INTRODUCTION


THESE VOLUMES TRY TO GIVE SOBERLY AND WITH WHAT TRUTH IS POSSIBLE
THE EXPERIENCES OF BOTH BATTALIONS OF THE IRISH GUARDS FROM 1914 TO
1918 THE POINT OF VIEW IS THE BATTALIONS AND THE FACTS MAINLY
FOLLOW THE REGIMENTAL DIARIES SUPPLEMENTED BY THE FEW PRIVATE
LETTERS AND DOCUMENTS WHICH SUCH A WAR MADE POSSIBLE AND BY SOME
TALES THAT HAVE GATHERED ROUND MEN AND THEIR ACTIONS

AS EVIDENCE IS RELEASED HISTORIANS MAY BE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT WHAT
HAPPENED IN OR BEHIND THE BATTLELINE WHAT MOTIVES AND NECESSITIES
SWAYED THE ACTORS AND WHO STOOD UP OR FAILED UNDER HIS BURDEN
BUT A BATTALIONS FIELD IS BOUNDED BY ITS OWN VISION EVEN WITHIN
THESE LIMITS THERE IS LARGE ROOM FOR ERROR WITNESSES TO PHASES OF
FIGHTS DIE AND ARE DISPERSED THE GROUND OVER WHICH THEY FOUGHT IS
BATTERED OUT OF RECOGNITION IN A FEW HOURS SURVIVORS CONFUSE DATES
PLACES AND PERSONALITIES AND IN THE TRENCHES THE MONOTONY OF THE
WAITING DAYS AND THE REPETITIONWORK OF REPAIRS BREED MISTAKES AND
FALSE JUDGMENTS MEN GROW DOUBTFUL OR OVERSURE AND IN ALL GOOD
FAITH GIVE DIRECTLY OPPOSED VERSIONS THE CLEAR SIGHT OF A COMRADE
SO MANGLED THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LONG DEAD IS BURNT IN ON ONE
BRAIN TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL ELSE THAT HAPPENED THAT DAY THE SHOCK
OF AN EXPLODED DUMP SHAKING DOWN A FIRMAMENT UPON THE LANDSCAPE
DISLOCATES MEMORY THROUGHOUT HALF A BATTALION AND SO ON IN ALL
MATTERS TILL THE END OF LABORIOUS ENQUIRY IS TOO OFTEN THE OPENING
OF FRESH CONFUSION WHEN TO THIS ARE ADDED THE PERSONAL PREJUDICES
AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF MEN UNDER HEAVY STRAIN CARRYING CLOUDED
MEMORIES OF ORDERS HALF GIVEN OR HALF HEARD AMID SCENES THAT PASS
LIKE NIGHTMARES THE ONLY WONDER TO THE COMPILER OF THESE RECORDS
HAS BEEN THAT ANY SURE FACT WHATEVER SHOULD BE RETRIEVED OUT OF THE
WHIRLPOOL OF WAR

IT SEEMED TO HIM BEST THEN TO ABANDON ALL IDEA OF SUCH BROAD
AND BALANCED NARRATIVES AS WILL BE PUT FORWARD BY EXPERTS AND TO
LIMIT HIMSELF TO MATTERS WHICH DIRECTLY TOUCHED THE MENS LIVES AND
FORTUNES NOR HAS HE BEEN TOO CAREFUL TO CORRECT THE INFERENCES OF
THE TIME BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF LATER EVENTS FROM FIRST TO LAST THE
IRISH GUARDS LIKE THE REST OF OUR ARMIES KNEW LITTLE OF WHAT WAS
GOING ON ROUND THEM PROBABLY THEY KNEW LESS AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
THAN AT THE BEGINNING WHEN OUR FORCES WERE SO SMALL THAT EACH MAN
FELT HIMSELF SOMEBODY INDEED AND SO STOOD TO BE HUNTED THROUGH THE
HEAT FROM MONS TO MEAUX TURNED AGAIN TO SUFFER BENEATH THE SOUPIR
RIDGES AND ENDURED THE FIRST HIDEOUS WINTER OF THE SALIENT WHERE
WET ALMOST WEAPONLESS BUT UNBROKEN HE HELPED IN THE LONG MIRACLE
OF HOLDING THE LINE

BUT THE MEN OF 14 AND 15 AND WHAT MEAGRE RECORDS OF THEIR DAY WERE
SAFE TO KEEP HAVE LONG BEEN LOST WHILE THE CROWDED YEARS BETWEEN
REMOVE THEIR BATTLES ACROSS DEAD BELGIAN TOWNS AND VILLAGES AS FAR
FROM US AS THE FIGHTS IN HOMER

DOUBTLESS ALL WILL BE RECONSTRUCTED TO THE SATISFACTION OF FUTURE
YEARS WHEN IF THERE BE MEMORY BEYOND THE GRAVE THE GHOSTS MAY
LAUGH AT THE NEATLY GROOMED HISTORIES MEANTIME WE CAN TAKE IT FOR
GRANTED THAT THE OLD REGULAR ARMY OF ENGLAND PASSED AWAY IN THE MUD
OF FLANDERS IN LESS THAN A YEAR IN TRAINING MORALE ENDURANCE
COURAGE AND DEVOTION THE EARTH DID NOT HOLD ITS LIKE BUT IT
POSSESSED NEITHER THE NUMBERS GUNS NOR EQUIPMENT NECESSARY FOR
THE TYPE OF WAR THAT OVERTOOK IT THE FACT OF ITS UNPREPAREDNESS
HAS BEEN EXTOLLED AS PROOF OF THE PURITY OF ITS COUNTRYS IDEALS
WHICH MUST BE GREAT CONSOLATION TO ALL CONCERNED BUT HOW SLOWLY
THAT EQUIPMENT WAS FURNISHED HOW INADEQUATE WERE OUR FIRST ATTEMPTS
AT BOMBS TRENCHMORTARS DUCKBOARDS WIRING AND THE REST MAY
BE DIVINED THROUGH THE LOYAL AND GUARDED ALLUSIONS IN THE DIARIES
NOR DO PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS GIVE MUCH HINT OF IT FOR ONE OF THE
MARVELS OF THAT MARVELLOUS TIME WAS THE SILENCE OF THOSE CONCERNED ON
EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT TOO MUCH DISTRESS THEIR FRIENDS AT HOME THE
CENSORSHIP HAD IMPOSED THIS AS A MATTER OF PRECAUTION BUT ONLY THE
SPIRIT OF THE OFFICERS COULD HAVE BACKED THE LAW SO COMPLETELY AND
AS BETTER DAYS CAME THEIR EARLY MAKESHIFTS AND CONTRIVANCES PASSED
OUT OF REMEMBRANCE WITH THEIR EARLY DEAD BUT THE SUFFERINGS OF OUR
ARMIES WERE CONSTANT THEY INCLUDED WET AND COLD IN DUE SEASON
DIRT ALWAYS OCCASIONAL VERMIN EXPOSURE EXTREME FATIGUE AND THE
HOURLY INCIDENCE OF DEATH IN EVERY SHAPE ALONG THE FRONT LINE AND
LATER IN THE FURTHEST BACKAREAS WHERE THE ENEMY AEROPLANES HARRIED
THEIR CAMPS AND WHEN OUR REGULAR TROOPS HAD BEEN EXPENDED THESE
EXPERIENCES WERE IMPOSED UPON OFFICERS AND MEN COMPELLED TO COVER
WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THE LONG YEARS OF TRAINING THAT SHOULD GO TO
THE MAKING OF A SOLDIERMEN UNBROKEN EVEN TO THE DISTURBING IMPACT
OF CROWDS AND LIKE EXPERIENCES WHICH THE CONSCRIPT ACCEPTS FROM HIS
YOUTH THEIR SHORT HOMELEAVES GAVE THEM SUDDEN CHANGES TO THE TENSE
HOME ATMOSPHERE WHERE UNDER COVER OF A WHIRL OF ENTERTAINMENT THEY
AND THEIR KIN WEARIED THEMSELVES TO FORGET AND ESCAPE A LITTLE FROM
THAT LIFE ON THE BRINK OF THE NEXT WORLD WHOSE GUNS THEY COULD HEAR
SUMMONING IN THE SILENCES BETWEEN THEIR TALK YET SOME WERE GLAD TO
RETURNELSE WHY SHOULD YOUNGSTERS OF THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE HAVE
FOUND THEMSELVES UPON A FROSTY NIGHT ON AN IRONBOUND FRENCH ROAD
SHOUTING ALOUD FOR JOY AS THEY HEARD THE STAMMER OF A MACHINEGUN
OVER THE RISE AND TURNED UP THE WELLKNOWN TRENCH THAT LED TO THEIR
OWN DUGOUT AND THEIR BRETHREN FROM WHOM THEY HAD BEEN SEPARATED
BY THE VAST INTERVAL OF NINETYSIX HOURS MANY HAVE CONFESSED TO
THE SAME DELIGHT IN THEIR WORK AS THERE WERE OTHERS TO WHOM ALMOST
EVERY HOUR WAS FRANKLY DETESTABLE EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANIONSHIP THAT
REVEALED THEM ONE TO ANOTHER TILL THE CHANCES OF WAR SEPARATED THE
COMPANIONS AND THERE WERE TOO MANY ALMOST CHILDREN OF WHOM NO
RECORD REMAINS THEY CAME OUT FROM WARLEY WITH THE CONSTANTLY RENEWED
DRAFTS LIVED THE SPAN OF A SECOND LIEUTENANTS LIFE AND WERE SPENT
THEIR INTIMATES MIGHT PRESERVE PERHAPS MEMORIES OF A PROMISE
CUT SHORT RECOLLECTIONS OF A PHRASE THAT STUCK A CHANCESEEN ACT
OF BRAVERY OR OF KINDNESS THE DIARIES GIVE THEIR NAMES AND FATES
WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET IN MOST INSTANCES THE
COMPILER HAS LET THE MERE FACT SUFFICE SINCE TO HIS MIND IT DID
NOT SEEM FIT TO HEAP WORDS ON THE DOOM

FOR THE SAME REASON HE HAS NOT DEALT WITH EACH INSTANCE OF VALOUR
LEAVING IT TO STAND IN THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT WAS
ACKNOWLEDGED THE REWARDS REPRESENT BUT A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF
THE SKILL DARING AND HEROISM ACTUALLY NOTED FOR NO VOLUME COULD
HOLD THE FULL TALE OF ALL THAT WAS DONE EITHER IN THE WAY OF DUTY
UNDER CONSTRAINT OF NECESSITY AND DESIRE TO KEEP ALIVE OR THROUGH
JOY AND PLEASURE IN ACHIEVING GREAT DEEDS

HERE THE IRISH RANK AND FILE BY TEMPERAMENT EXCELLED THEY HAD
ALL THEIR RACES DELIGHT IN THE DRAMA OF THINGS AND WHATEVER
THE PINCHWHETHER AMBUSHED WARFARE OR HANDTOHAND SHOCK
OR AN INSOLENTLY PERFECT PARADE AFTER LONG DIVORCE FROM THE
DECENCIESCOULD BE DEPENDED UPON TO ADVANCE THE REGIMENTAL HONOUR
THEIR DISCIPLINE OF COURSE WAS THAT OF THE GUARDS WHICH BASED
UPON TRADITION PROVEN EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN HEART
ADJUSTS ITSELF TO THE SPIRIT OF EACH OF ITS BATTALIONS THOUGH THE
MATERIAL OF THAT BODY MIGHT BE EXPENDED TWICE IN A TWELVEMONTH THE
LEAVEN THAT REMAINED WORKED ON THE NEW SUPPLIES AT ONCE AND FROM THE
FIRST IN THE DINGY OUTOFDATE BARRACKS AT WARLEY THE REGIMENTAL
RESERVES GATHERED AND GREW INTO A FULLFLEDGED SECOND BATTALION
WITH RESERVES OF ITS OWN AND TO THESE THE WOUNDED OFFICERS AND
MEN SENT HOME TO BE REPATCHED EXPLAINED THE ARTS AND NEEDS OF A
WAR WHICH APPARENTLY ALWAYS AT A STAND CHANGED CHARACTER EVERY
MONTH AFTER THE UTTER INADEQUACY OF ITS OPENING THERE WAS A PERIOD
OF HANDMADE BOMBS AND OF LOADED STICKS FOR CLOSE WORK OF NIPPERS
FOR THE ABUNDANT WIRE LEFT UNCUT BY OUR FEW GUNS OF REMEDIES FOR
TRENCHFEET OR MEDICAMENTS AGAINST LOCKJAW FROM THE GROSSLY MANURED
BELGIAN DIRT AND OF FANCY TIMBERINGS TO HOLD UP SLIDING TRENCHES
IN DUE COURSE WHEN A FEW SET BATTLES WHICH SOMETIMES GAINED SEVERAL
HUNDRED YARDS HAD WASTED THEIR MANY THOUSAND LIVES INFALLIBLE FORMS
OF ATTACK AND DEFENCE DEVELOPED THEMSELVES WERE TRIED AND GENERALLY
FOUND WANTING WHILE SCIENTIFIC RAIDS THE EVOLUTION OF SPECIALISTS
AND THE MASS OF REGULATED DETAIL THAT MORE AND MORE SURROUNDED THE
LIFE OF THE TRENCHES OCCUPIED THEIR LEISURE BETWEEN ACTIONS OUR
BATTALIONS PLAYED THEMSELVES INTO THE GAME AT THE AWFUL PRICE THAT
MUST BE PAID FOR IMPROVISATION HOWEVER CHEERY ENDURING WITH A
PHILOSOPHY THAT MAY HAVE SAVED THE WAR THE DEVIATIONS AND DELAYS
MADE NECESSARY BY THE DEMANDS OF THE VARIOUS POLITICAL AND OTHER
ORGANISATIONS AT HOME

IN THE SAME SPIRIT THEY ACCEPTED THE INEVITABLE BREAKDOWNS IN THE
BUSINESS OF WARBYEXPERIMENT FOR IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE
WAS HARDLY AN OPERATION IN WHICH PLATOONS COMPANIES REGIMENTS
BRIGADES OR DIVISIONS WERE NOT LEFT WITH ONE OR BOTH FLANKS IN THE
AIR AMONG THEMSELVES OFFICERS AND MEN DISCUSSING SUCH MATTERS MAKE
IT QUITE CLEAR HOW AND WHY SUCH AND SUCH UNITS BROKE WERE MISLED
OR DELAYED ON THEIR WAY INTO THE LINE BUT WHEN A CIVILIAN PRESUMES
TO ASSIST ALL RANKS UNITE AGAINST HIS UNINFORMED CRITICISMS
HE IS WARNED THAT ONCE OVER THE TOP NO PLANS HOLD FOR THE
MACHINEGUN AND THE LIE OF THE GROUND DICTATE THE SITUATION TO THE
PLATOONCOMMANDER ON WHOM ALL THINGS DEPEND AND WHO SEES PERHAPS
FIFTY YARDS ABOUT HIM THERE ARE LIMITS TOO OF SHOCK AND EXHAUSTION
BEYOND WHICH HUMANITY CANNOT BE PRESSED WITHOUT PAYING TOLL LATER
FOR WHICH CAUSE IT MAY HAPPEN THAT A DIVISION THAT HAS BORNE LONG
AGONY UNFLINCHING AND SINCERELY BELIEVES ITSELF CAPABLE OF YET MORE
WILL FOR NO REASON THEN APPARENT AT ALMOST THE MERE RUMOUR OF
NOISES IN THE NIGHT COLLAPSE IGNOMINIOUSLY ON THE SAME GROUND WHERE
A MONTH LATER WITH TWO THIRDS OF ITS STRENGTH CASUALTIES IT CUTS
COOLLY AND CLEANLY TO ITS GOAL AND ITS FELLOWS WHO HAVE BORNE THE
SAME YOKE ALLOW FOR THIS

THE COMPILER OF THESE RECORDS THEREFORE HAS MADE LITTLE ATTEMPT
TO PUT FORWARD ANY THEORY OF WHAT MIGHT OR SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF
THINGS HAD GONE ACCORDING TO PLAN AND HAS BEEN SCRUPULOUS TO AVOID
DEBATABLE ISSUES OF BAD STAFFWORK OR FAULTY GENERALSHIP THEY WERE
NOT LACKING IN THE WAR BUT THE BROAD SENSE OF JUSTICE IN ALL WHO
SUFFERED FROM THEM RECOGNISING THAT ALL WERE EQUALLY AMATEURS SAVED
THE DEPRESSION OF REPEATED FAILURES FROM TURNING INTO DEMORALISATION

HERE AGAIN THE IRISH WERE REPORTED BY THOSE WHO KNEW THEM BEST TO
HAVE BEEN LENIENT IN THEIR JUDGMENTS THOUGH THEIR PRIVATE SPEECH
WAS AS UNRESTRAINED AS THAT OF ANY OTHER BODY OF BEWILDERED AND
OVERMASTERED MEN WEARING DOWN THE ENEMY THROUGH A PERIOD OF FOUR
YEARS AND THREE MONTHS DURING MOST OF WHICH TIME THAT ENEMY DEALT
LOSSES AT LEAST EQUAL TO THOSE HE RECEIVED TESTED HUMAN VIRTUE UPON
A SCALE THAT THE WORLD HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THE IRISH GUARDS STOOD
TO THE TEST WITHOUT FLAW

THEY WERE IN NO SENSE ANY MANS COMMAND THEY NEEDED MINUTE
COMPREHENSION QUICK SYMPATHY AND INFLEXIBLE JUSTICE WHICH THEY
REPAID BY INDIVIDUAL DEVOTION AND A COLLECTIVE GOODWILL THAT SHOWED
BEST WHEN THINGS WERE AT THEIR UTTER WORST THEIR MOODS NATURALLY
VARIED WITH THE WEATHER AND THE BURDEN OF FATIGUES ACTIONS MERELY
KILL WHILE FATIGUE BREAKS MENS HEARTS BUT THEIR MORALE WAS
CONSTANT BECAUSE THEIR UNOFFICIAL LIFE ON WHICH MORALE HINGES MADE
FOR CONTENTMENT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE GUARDS DEMANDING THE UTMOST
THAT CAN BE EXACTED OF THE MAN REQUIRES OF THE OFFICER UNRESTING
CARE OF HIS MEN UNDER ALL CONDITIONS THIS CARE CAN BE A SOURCE OF
SORROW AND FRICTION IN RIGID OR OVERCONSCIENTIOUS HANDS TILL
WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD A BATTALION MAY BE REDUCED TO THE
MENTAL STATE OF NURSEHARRIED CHILDREN OR CONVERSELY AN ADORED
COMPANY COMMANDER BOLD AS A LION MAY FOR LACK OF IT TURN HIS
PUZZLED COMPANY INTO A BEARGARDEN BUT THERE IS AN ELASTICITY IN
CELTIC PSYCHOLOGY THAT DOES NOT OFTEN LET THINGS REACH BREAKINGPOINT
EITHER WAY AND THEIR SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SOCIAL DUTYIT IS A RACE
MORE CAREFUL TO REGARD EACH OTHERS FEELINGS THAN EACH OTHERS
LIVESHELD THEM AS EASILY AS THEY WERE STRICTLY ASSOCIATED A JEST
THE GRAVE HEARING OUT OF ABSURD COMPLAINTS THAT MIGHT TURN TO TRAGEDY
WERE THE HEARING NOT ACCORDED A PROMPT SOOTHING DOWN OF GLOOMY
INJURED PRIDE A PIECE OF FLAGRANT BUFFOONERY SANCTIONED EVEN
SHARED BUT NEVER TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WENT FAR IN DARK DAYS TO BUILD
UP THAT UNDERSTANDING AND UNDERSTOOD INNER LIFE OF THE TWO BATTALIONS
TO WHICH NOW MEN LOOK BACK LOVINGLY ACROSS THEIR CIVILIAN YEARS
IT CALLED FOR A DEVOTION FROM ALL LITTLE THIS SIDE OF IDOLATRY AND
WAS SHOWN EQUALLY BY OFFICERS NCOS AND MEN STRETCHERBEARERS
COOKS ORDERLIES AND NOT LEAST BY THE HARDBIT FANTASTIC OLD
SOLDIERS USED FOR ODD DUTIES WHO FAITHFULLY HOBBLED ABOUT FRANCE
ALONGSIDE THE RUSH OF WONDERFUL YOUNG BLOOD

WERE INSTANCES GIVEN THE IMPRESSION MIGHT BE FALSE FOR THE TONE
AND TEMPER OF THE TIME THAT SET THE PACE HAS GONE OVER BUT WHILE
IT LASTED THE MEN MADE THEIR OFFICERS AND THE OFFICERS THEIR MEN
BY METHODS AS OLD AS WAR ITSELF AND THEIR ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS
FEARLESS EVEN IN A COMMUNITY NONE TOO REGARDFUL OF NATURES FIRST
LAW FORMED A SUBTLE AND SUPPLE LINK BETWEEN BOTH THAT THE PRIEST
EVER IN WAITING UPON DEATH OR PAIN SHOULD LEARN TO MAGNIFY HIS
OFFICE WAS AS NATURAL AS THAT DOCTORS AND FRONTLINE COMMANDERS
SHOULD FIND HIM SOMEWHAT UNDER THEIR FEET WHEN OCCASION CALLED FOR
THE SECULAR NOT THE SPIRITUAL ARM THAT COMMANDING OFFICERS TO
KEEP PEACE AND SAVE IMPORTANT PILLARS OF THEIR LITTLE SOCIETY SHOULD
FIRST ADVISE AND FINALLY ORDER THE PADRE NOT TO EXPOSE HIMSELF
WANTONLY IN FORWARD POSTS OR ATTACKS WAS EQUALLY OF A PIECE WITH
HUMAN NATURE AND THAT THE PRIESTS TO THE HUGE CONTENT OF THE
MEN SHOULD DISREGARD THE ORDER WHATS A CASUALTY COMPARED TO A
SOUL WAS MOST NATURAL OF ALL THEN THE QUESTION WOULD COME UP FOR
DISCUSSION IN THE TRENCHES AND DUGOUTS WHERE EVERYTHING THAT ANY
ONE HAD ON HIS MIND WAS THRASHED OUT THROUGH THE LONG QUIET HOURS
OR DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN WITH THE RISE AND FALL OF SHELLFIRE
THEY SPECULATED ON ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH AS THEY WORKED IN
PILED FILTH AMONG THE CARCASES OF THEIR FELLOWS LAY OUT UNDER THE
STARS ON THE EVES OF OPEN BATTLE OR VEGETATED THROUGH A MONTHS
FEEDING AND IDLENESS BETWEEN ONE SACRIFICE AND THE NEXT

BUT NONE HAVE KEPT MINUTES OF THOSE INCREDIBLE SYMPOSIA THAT MADE FOR
THEM A LIFE APART FROM THE MAD WORLD WHICH WAS THEIR PORTION NOR
CAN ANY PEN RECREATE THAT WORLDS BRILLIANCE SQUALOR UNREASON AND
HEAPED BOREDOM RECOLLECTION FADES FROM MENS MINDS AS COMMON LIFE
CLOSES OVER THEM TILL EVEN NOW THEY WONDER WHAT PART THEY CAN EVER
HAVE HAD IN THE SHREWD MANHUNTING SAVAGES WHO ANSWERED TO THEIR
NAMES SO FEW YEARS AGO

IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF THESE INITIATED THAT THE COMPILER HAS LOADED
HIS RECORDS WITH DETAIL AND SEEMING TRIVIALITY SINCE IN A LIFE WHERE
DEATH RULED EVERY HOUR NOTHING WAS TRIVIAL AND BALD REFERENCES TO
VILLAGES BILLETS CAMPS FATIGUES AND SPORTS AS WELL AS HINTS OF
TALES THAT CAN NEVER NOW FULLY BE TOLD CARRY EACH THEIR SEPARATE
SIGNIFICANCE TO EACH SURVIVOR INTIMATE AND INCOMMUNICABLE AS FAMILY
JESTS

AS REGARDS OTHER READERS THE COMPILER DARES NO MORE THAN HOPE THAT
SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO CARE FOR OLD HISTORY OR THAT LARGER NUMBER
WHO AT PRESENT ARE PUTTING AWAY FROM THEMSELVES ODIOUS MEMORIES MAY
FIND A LITTLE TO INTEREST OR EVEN COMFORT IN THESE VERY DETAILS AND
FLATNESSES THAT MAKE UP THE UNLOVELY YET SUPERB LIFE ENDURED FOR
THEIR SAKES

THEY REACHED HAVRE AT 6 A M ON AUGUST 13 A FIERCELY HOT DAY AND
TIRED AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT ABOARD SHIP AND A LONG WAIT IN A
HOT TINROOFED SHED FOR SOME MISSING MEN MARCHED THREE MILES OUT
OF THE TOWN TO REST CAMP NO 2 IN A LARGE FIELD AT SANVIC A SUBURB
OF HAVRE AT THE TOP OF THE HILL LATER THE CITY HERSELF BECAME
ALMOST A SUBURB TO THE VAST RESTCAMPS ROUND IT HERE THEY RECEIVED
AN ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME FROM THE FRENCH AND WERE FIRST LARGELY
INTRODUCED TO THE WINES OF THE COUNTRY FOR MANY MAIDENS LINED THE
STEEP ROAD AND OFFERED BOWLS OF DRINKS TO THE WEARIED

NEXT DAY AUGUST 14 MEN RESTED A LITTLE LOOKING AT THIS STRANGE
BRIGHT FRANCE WITH STRANGE EYES AND BATHED IN THE SEA AND CAPTAIN
H BERNERS REPLACING SIR DELVES BROUGHTON JOINED AT ELEVEN
OCLOCK THEY ENTRAINED AT HAVRE STATION UNDER SECRET ORDERS FOR THE
FRONT THE HEAT BROKE IN A TERRIBLE THUNDERSTORM THAT SOAKED THE NEW
UNIFORMS THE CROWDED TRAIN TRAVELLED NORTH ALL DAY RECEIVING GREAT
WELCOMES EVERYWHERE BUT NO ONE KNOWING WHAT ITS DESTINATION MIGHT
BE AFTER MORE THAN SEVENTEEN HOURS SLOW PROGRESS BY ROADS THAT WERE
NOT REVEALED THEN OR LATER THEY HALTED AT WASSIGNY AT A QUARTER TO
ELEVEN ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 15 AND UNLOADING IN HOT DARKNESS
BIVOUACKED AT A FARM NEAR THE STATION

ON THE MORNING OF AUGUST 16 THEY MARCHED TO VADENCOURT WHERE FOR
THE FIRST TIME THEY WENT INTO BILLETS THE VILLAGE A COLLECTION OF
TYPICAL WHITEWASHED TILED HOUSES WITH A LOVELY OLD CHURCH IN THE
CENTRE LAY OUT PLEASANTLY BY THE SIDE OF A POPLARPLANTED STREAM
THE 2ND COLDSTREAM GUARDS WERE ALSO BILLETED HERE THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE THE 2ND GRENADIER GUARDS AND 3RD
COLDSTREAM BEING AT GROUGIS ALL SUPPLIES BE IT NOTED CAME FROM A
VILLAGE OF THE OMINOUS NAME OF BOUE WHICHAS THEY WERE TO LEARN
THROUGH THE FOUR WINTERS TO FOLLOWMEANS MUD

AT VADENCOURT THEY LAY THREE DAYS WHILE THE MEN WERE BEING INOCULATED
AGAINST ENTERIC A FEW HAD BEEN SO TREATED BEFORE LEAVING WELLINGTON
BARRACKS BUT IN VIEW OF THE HURRIED DEPARTURE 90 PER CENT
REMAINED TO BE DEALT WITH THE DIARY REMARKS THAT FOR TWO DAYS THE
BATTALION WAS NOT UP TO MUCH MAJOR H CRICHTON FELL SICK HERE

ON THE 20TH AUGUST THE MARCH TOWARDS BELGIUM OF THE BRIGADE BEGAN
VIA ETREUX AND FESMY WHERE LIEUTENANT AND QUARTERMASTER HICKIE
WENT SICK AND HAD TO BE SENT BACK TO RAILHEAD TO MAROILLES WHERE
THE BATTALION BILLETED AUGUST 21 AND THENCE VIA PONT SUR SAMBRE
AND HARGNIES TO LA LONGUEVILLE AUGUST 22 HERE BEING THEN FIVE
MILES EAST OF MALPLAQUET THE BATTALION HEARD THE FIRST SOUND OF THE
GUNS OF THE WAR FAR OFF NOT KNOWING THAT AT THE END OF ALL THEY
WOULD HEAR THEM CEASE ALMOST ON THAT VERY SPOT

AT THREE OCLOCK IN THE MORNING OF AUGUST 23 THE BRIGADE MARCHED
VIA RIEZ DE LERELLE INTO BELGIAN TERRITORY AND THROUGH BLAREGNIES
TOWARDS MONS WHERE IT WAS DIMLY UNDERSTOOD THAT SOME SORT OF BATTLE
WAS IN THE MAKING BUT IT WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT EIGHTY THOUSAND
BRITISH TROOPS WITH THREE HUNDRED GUNS DISPOSED BETWEEN COND
THROUGH MONS TOWARDS BINCHE WERE MEETING TWICE THAT NUMBER OF
GERMANS ON THEIR FRONT PLUS SIXTY THOUSAND GERMANS WITH TWO HUNDRED
AND THIRTY GUNS TRYING TO TURN THEIR LEFT FLANK WHILE A QUARTER OF A
MILLION GERMANS WITH CLOSE ON A THOUSAND GUNS WERE DRIVING IN THE
FRENCH ARMIES ON THE BRITISH RIGHT FROM CHARLEROI TO NAMUR ACROSS
THE MEUSE AND THE SAMBRE THIS IN SUBSTANCE WAS THE SITUATION AT
MONS IT SUPPLIED A SUFFICIENT ANSWER TO THE IMMORTAL QUESTION
PUT BY ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THE BATTALION A DRILL SERGEANT WHO
HAPPENED TO ARRIVE FROM HOME JUST AS THAT SITUATION HAD EXPLAINED
ITSELF AND FOUND HIS BATTALION STEADILY MARCHING SOUTH FWHATS ALL
THIS TALK ABOUT A RETREAT SAID HE AND STRICTLY REBUKED THE SHOUTS
OF LAUGHTER THAT FOLLOWED1


THE RETREAT FROM MONS

THE BRIGADE WAS FIRST ORDERED TO TAKE UP A POSITION AT BOIS LAHANT
CLOSE TO THE DIRTIER SUBURBS OF MONS WHICH IS A FAIR CITY ON A HILL
BUT THE ORDER WAS CANCELLED WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FIFTH
DIVISION WAS ALREADY THERE EVENTUALLY THE IRISH GUARDS WERE TOLD
TO MOVE FROM THE VILLAGE OF QUEVY LE PETIT WHERE THEY HAD EXPECTED
TO GO INTO BILLETS TO HARVENG HERE THEY WERE ORDERED WITH THE 2ND
GRENADIER GUARDS TO SUPPORT THE FIFTH DIVISION ON A CHALK RIDGE
FROM HARMIGNIES TO THE MONS ROAD WHILE THE OTHER TWO BATTALIONS OF
THE BRIGADE THE 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM GUARDS TOOK UP POSITION
NORTHEAST OF HARVENG THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MIGHT BE IN FRONT
OF THEM OR WHO WAS IN SUPPORT WAS NATURALLY SMALL IT WAS A HOT
STILL EVENING NO GERMANS WERE VISIBLE BUT SHRAPNEL FELL AHEAD OF
THE BATTALION AS IT MOVED IN ARTILLERY FORMATION ACROSS THE ROLLING
CROPPED LANDS ONE SINGLE FARRANGING RIFLE BULLET LANDED WITH A
PHTT IN THE CHALK BETWEEN TWO OFFICERS ONE OF WHOM TURNING TO
THE OTHER LAUGHED AND SAID AH NOW WE CAN SAY WE HAVE BEEN UNDER
FIRE A FEW MORE SHELLS ARRIVED AS THE ADVANCE TO THE RIDGE WENT
FORWARD AND THE BRIGADE REACHED THE SEVENTH KILOMETRESTONE ON THE
HARMIGNIESMONS ROAD BELOW THE RIDGE ABOUT 6 P M ON THE 23RD
AUGUST THE IRISH RIFLES COMMANDED BY COLONEL BIRD DSO WERE
FIGHTING HERE AND NOS 1 AND 2 COMPANIES OF THE IRISH GUARDS WENT
UP TO REINFORCE IT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE BATTALION HAD
BEEN PERSONALLY SHELLED AND FIVE MEN WERE WOUNDED THE GUNS CEASED
ABOUT DUSK AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FIRE FROM THE GERMAN TRENCHES
WHICH WERE RATHER IN THE NATURE OF SCRATCHHOLES AHEAD OF THEM THAT
NIGHT TOO WAS THE FIRST ON WHICH THE TROOPS SAW A SEARCHLIGHT USED
THEY ENJOYED ALSO THEIR FIRST EXPERIENCE OF DIGGING THEMSELVES IN
THE WHICH THEY DID SO CASUALLY THAT VETERANS OF AFTER YEARS WOULD
HOLD UP THAT TRENCH AS A SAMPLE OF THE VALOUR OF IGNORANCE AT
MIDNIGHT THE IRISH RIFLES WERE ORDERED TO RETIRE WHILE THE IRISH

AT 2 OCLOCK IN THE MORNING OF AUGUST 24 THE BATTALION HAVING
COVERED THE RETIREMENT OF ALL THE OTHER TROOPS RETIRED THROUGH
THE POSITION WHICH THE 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM GUARDS HAD TAKEN UP
TO QUEVY LE PETIT WHERE IT WAS ORDERED WITH THE 2ND GRENADIERS
TO ENTRENCH ANOTHER POSITION NORTH OF QUEVY LE PETIT FROM THE
THIRD KILOMETRESTONE ON THE GENLYQUEVY LE PETIT ROAD TO THE TENTH
KILOMETRESTONE ON THE MONSBETTIGNIES ROAD THIS IT DID WHILE THE
WHOLE OF THE SECOND DIVISION RETIRED THROUGH THE POSITION AT 4 P
M THE BATTALION ACTING AS REARGUARD THEIR NOTION OF DIGGINGIN
WAS TO CUT FIRESTEPS IN THE SIDE OF THE HANDY BANK OF ANY ROAD AT
NINE OCLOCK THAT NIGHT THE BATTALION CAME OUT OF BELGIUM BY THE
SAME ROAD THAT IT HAD MARCHED INTO BELGIUM THROUGH BLAREGNIES PAST
BAVAI WHERE THE FIRST AND SECOND ARMY CORPS DIVERGED AND THROUGH LA
LONGUEVILLE TO MALGARNI WHERE THEY BIVOUACKED IN AN ORCHARD HAVING
BEEN FORTYFOUR HOURS UNDER ARMS HERE THE FIRST MAIL FROM ENGLAND
ARRIVED AND WAS DISTRIBUTED BY TORCHLIGHT UNDER THE APPLETREES IN
THE WARM NIGHT

ON THE AFTERNOON OF AUGUST 25 THE BATTALION REACHED LANDRECIES AN
UNLOVELY LONGSTREETED TOWN IN CLOSELY CULTIVATED COUNTRY THE
GERMAN PRESSURE WAS HEAVY BEHIND THEM AND THAT EVENING THE 3RD
COLDSTREAM GUARDS ON OUTPOST DUTY TO THE NORTHWEST OF LANDRECIES
ON THE MORMAL ROAD WERE ATTACKED AND AS HISTORY SHOWS BEAT
OFF THAT ATTACK IN A NIGHTFIGHT OF SOME SPLENDOUR THE BATTALION
TURNED OUT AND BLOCKED THE PAV ENTRANCE TO THE TOWN WITH IMPROVISED
BARRICADES WHICH THEY LINED OF STONES TABLES CHAIRS CARTS AND
PIANOS RELIEVED THE COLDSTREAM AT 130 A M AUGUST 26 AND ONCE
AGAIN COVERED THE RETIREMENT OF THE BRIGADE OUT OF THE TOWN TOWARDS
ETREUX THE MEN WERE VERY TIRED SO WEARY INDEED THAT MANY OF THEM
SLEPT BY THE ROADSIDE WHILE WAITING TO RELIEVE THE COLDSTREAMS AT
LANDRECIES FIGHT THAT NIGHT WAS THE FIRST THEY HEARD WOUNDED MEN
SCREAM A COUPLE OF IRISH GUARDS OFFICERS SLEEPING SO DEEPLY THAT
ONLY THE DEMOLITION BY SHELLFIRE OF THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR WAKED THEM
WERE LEFT BEHIND HERE BUT AFTER TWENTYFOUR HOURS OF FANTASTIC AND
AT THAT TIME ALMOST INCREDIBLE ADVENTURES REJOINED SAFELY NEXT DAY
IT WAS RECORDED ALSO THAT ONE OF THE REGIMENTAL DRUMS WAS SEEN AND
HEARD GOING DOWN LANDRECIES MAIN STREET IN THE DARKNESS STRUNG ON
THE FORELEG OF A GUNHORSE WHO HAD STEPPED INTO IT AS A BATTERY WENT
SOUTH A BATTALION COOKER THE SPARKS FLYING FROM IT PASSED LIKE
A FIREENGINE HASTENING TO A FIRE AND MEN FOUND TIME TO LAUGH AND
POINT AT THE STRANGE THING

AT ETREUX WHERE WITH THE REST OF THE BRIGADE THE BATTALION
ENTRENCHED ITSELF AFTER THE SHALLOW PATTERN OF THE TIME IT HAD
ITS FIRST SIGHT OF A GERMAN AEROPLANE WHICH FLEW OVER ITS TRENCHES
AND DROPPED A BOMB THAT MISSED A TRENCH BY TWENTY YARDS THE
BATTALION FIRED AT IT AND IT FLEW AWAY LIKE A WOUNDED BIRD AND
EVENTUALLY CAME DOWN AND WAS CAPTURED BY ANOTHER DIVISION BOTH
SIDES WERE EQUALLY INEXPERIENCED IN THOSE DAYS IN THE DETAILS OF
AIR WAR ALL THAT DAY THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF WHAT THEY JUDGED WAS
A BATTLE IN THE DIRECTION OF LE CATEAU THIS WAS THE SECOND ARMY
CORPS AND A SINGLE DIVISION OF THE THIRD CORPS UNDER SMITHDORRIEN
INTERRUPTING OUR RETIREMENT TO MAKE A STAND AGAINST FOUR OR MORE
GERMAN ARMY CORPS AND SIX HUNDRED GUNS THE RESULT OF THAT ACTION
CAUSED THE DISCERNING GENERAL VON KLUCK TO TELEGRAPH THAT HE HELD
THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE SURROUNDED BY A RING OF STEEL AND BERLIN
BEHUNG ITSELF WITH FLAGS THIS ALSO THE BATTALION DID NOT KNOW
THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE FACT THAT THEY HAD LOST TOUCH WITH
THE SECOND DIVISION AND THAT THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER HAD TOLD THE
OFFICERS THAT SO FAR AS HE COULD MAKE OUT THEY WERE SURROUNDED AND
HAD BETTER DIG IN DEEPER AND WAIT ON AS NO ONE KNEW PARTICULARLY
WHERE THEY MIGHT BE IN ALL FRANCE AND AS THE NIGHT OF THE 26TH WAS
VERY WET THE TIRED MEN SLEPT UNDISTURBEDLY OVER THE PROPOSITION
TO RESUME THEIR RETREAT NEXT DAY AUGUST 27 DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE
SAMBRE THROUGH VNROLLES TUPIGNY VADENCOURT NOYALES TO THE
OPEN GLARING COUNTRY ROUND MONT DORIGNY WHERE THE BROAD ROAD TO
ST QUENTIN CROSSES THE RIVER IT WAS IN RESERVE THAT DAY AND THE
NEXT AUGUST 28 WAS ADVANCEGUARD TO THE BRIGADE AS THE RETIREMENT
CONTINUED THROUGH CHTILLON BERTHENICOURT AND MOY TO VENDEUIL
AND THE CROSSROADS WEST OF THE VENDEUILLA FRE ROAD WHILE THE
BRIGADE MARCHED ON TO BERTAUCOURT AFTER THE BRIGADE HAD PASSED THE
BATTALION ACTED AS REARGUARD INTO BERTAUCOURT HERE NO 2 COMPANY
UNDER MAJOR STEPNEY WAS SENT TO BEAUTOR TO ASSIST A SECTION OF THE
ROYAL ENGINEERS IN DEMOLISHING A BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER THEREAN
OPERATION PERFORMED WITHOUT INCIDENTAND IN DUE COURSE JOINED UP
WITH THE BATTALION AGAIN BY THIS TIME THE RETREAT AS ONE WHO
TOOK PART IN IT SAYS HAD BECOME CURIOUSLY NORMALTHE EFFECT
DOUBTLESS OF THAT CONTINUED OVEREXERTION WHICH REDUCES MEN TO THE
STATE OF SLEEPWALKERS THERE WAS A TEN MINUTES HALT EVERY HOUR ON
WHICH THE WHOLE BATTALION DROPPED WHERE IT STOOD AND SLEPT AT NIGHT
SOME OF THEM BEGAN TO SEE LIGHTS LIKE THOSE OF COMFORTABLE BILLETS
BY THE ROADSIDE WHICH FOR SOME CURIOUS REASON OR OTHER COULD NEVER
BE REACHED OTHERS FOUND THEMSELVES ASLEEP ON THEIR FEET AND EVEN
WHEN THEY LAY DOWN TO SNATCH SLEEP THE MARCH MOVED ON AND WEARIED
THEM IN THEIR DREAMS OWING TO THE HEAT AND THE DUST MANY SUFFERED
FROM SORE FEET AND EXHAUSTION AND SINCE AMBULANCE ACCOMMODATION WAS
LIMITED THEY HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND TO FOLLOW ON IF AND AS BEST
THEY COULD BUT THOSE WHO FELL OUT WERE FEW AND THE DIARY REMARKS
APPROVINGLY THAT ON THE WHOLE THE BATTALION MARCHED VERY WELL AND
MARCHDISCIPLINE WAS GOOD NEITHER BRIGADE NOR BATTALION COMMANDERS
KNEW ANYTHING OF WHAT WAS AHEAD OR BEHIND BUT IT SEEMED THAT SINCE
THEY COULD NOT GET INTO PARIS BEFORE THE GERMANS AND TAKE FIRSTCLASS
TICKETS TO LONDON THEY WOULD ALL BE CUT OFF AND DESTROYED WHICH DID
NOT DEPRESS THEM UNDULY AT ALL EVENTS THE BATTALION ONE EVENING
FORGOT ITS WEARINESS LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE PART IN THE CHASE AND
CAPTURE OF A STRAY HORSE OF BELGIAN EXTRACTION WHICH AFTER ITS
AMPLE LACK OF MANNERS AND MOUTH HAD BEEN PROVED THEY TURNED OVER FOR
INSTRUCTION AND REFORMATION TO THE TRANSPORT

FROM BERTAUCOURT THEN WHERE THE BATTALION SPENT ANOTHER NIGHT IN
AN ORCHARD IT MARCHED VERY EARLY ON THE 30TH AUGUST TO TERNY VIA
DEUILLET SERVAIS BASSE FORT DE COUCY FOLEMBRAY COUCYLECHTEAU
THEN MAGNIFICENT AND UNTOUCHEDALL CLOSER MODELLED COUNTRY AND
IF POSSIBLE HOTTER THAN THE BARE LANDS THEY HAD LEFT THENCE FROM
TERNY TO PASLY NW OF SOISSONS HERE THEY LAY DOWN BY MOONLIGHT IN
A FIELD AND HERE AN OFFICER DREAMED THAT THE ALARM HAD BEEN GIVEN
AND THAT THEY MUST MOVE ON IN THIS NIGHTMARE HE ROSE AND WOKE UP ALL
PLATOONOFFICERS AND THE CO NEXT LABORIOUSLY AND METHODICALLY
HIS OWN COMPANY AND LAST OF ALL HIMSELF WHOM HE FOUND SHAKING AND
SWEARING AT A MAN EQUALLY DRUNK WITH FATIGUE

ON THE 31ST AUGUST THE BATTALION TOOK POSITION AS RIGHT FLANKGUARD
FROM 9 A M TO 3 P M ON THE HIGH GROUND NEAR LE MURGER FARM AND
BIVOUACKED AT SOUCY SO FAR THERE HAD BEEN LITTLE FIGHTING FOR THEM
SINCE LANDRECIES THOUGH THEY MOVED WITH THE COMFORTING KNOWLEDGE
THAT AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF THE ENEMY THOROUGHLY PROVIDED WITH MEANS
OF TRANSPORTATION WERE IN FIXED PURSUIT JUST ON THE EDGE OF A
SKYLINE FULL OF UNSEEN GUNS URGING THE BRITISH ALWAYS TO MOVE BACK


VILLERSCOTTERTS

ON THE 1ST SEPTEMBER THE ANNIVERSARY OF SEDAN THE BATTALION
WAS AFOOT AT 2 A M AND WITH THE 2ND COLDSTREAM GUARDS ACTED AS
REARGUARD UNDER THE COMMANDING OFFICER LIEUTCOLONEL THE HON G
MORRIS THERE HAD BEEN HEAVY DEW IN THE NIGHT FOLLOWED AT DAWN BY
THIN MISERABLE RAIN WHEN THEY BREAKFASTED AMONG WET LUCERNE AND
FIELDS OF STACKED CORN ON THE EDGE OF THE DEEP VILLERSCOTTERTS
BEECHFORESTS THEY FELL BACK INTO THEM ON A RUMOUR OF ADVANCING
CAVALRY WHO TURNED OUT TO BE TROOPS OF GERMAN INFANTRY RUNNING
FROM STACK TO STACK AND FILTERING INTO THE FOREST ON THEIR EITHER
FLANK THEIR FIRST POSITION WAS THE VIVIRES PUISEUX LINE A LITTLE
SOUTHWEST OF SOUCY VILLAGE THE BATTALION TO THE RIGHT OF THE
SOUCYVILLERSCOTTERTS ROAD AND THE COLDSTREAM TO THE LEFT ON A
FRONT OF NOT MORE THAN A MILE THEIR SECOND POSITION AS FAR AS
CAN BE MADE OUT WAS THE ROND DE LA REINE A MILE FARTHER SOUTH
WHERE THE DEEP SOFT FORESTROADS FROM SOUCY AND VIVIRES JOIN ON
THEIR WAY TO VILLERSCOTTERTS THE ENEMY RAN IN UPON THEM FROM
ALL SIDES AND THE ACTION RESOLVED ITSELF INTO BLIND FIGHTING IN
THE GLOOM OF THE WOODS WITH OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF MEN CROSSING
THE RIDES OR FIRING FROM BEHIND TREEBOLES THE GERMANS WERE VERY
CAUTIOUS AT FIRST BECAUSE OUR FIREDISCIPLINE AS WE FELL BACK GAVE
THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FOREST WAS FILLED WITH MACHINEGUNS
INSTEAD OF MERE TRAINED MEN FIRING TOGETHER SUSTAINEDLY THE MORNING
WET CLEARED AND THE DAY GREW CLOSE AND STIFLING THERE WAS NO
POSSIBILITY OF KEEPING TOUCH OR CONVEYING ORDERS SINCE THE GERMAN
ADVANCEGUARD WAS BY COMPARISON AN ARMY ALL THAT COULD BE DONE WAS
TO HOLD BACK AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THE ATTACKS ON FRONT AND FLANK AND
TO RETAIN SOME SENSE OF DIRECTION IN THE BULLETTORN WOODS WHERE
WHEN A MAN DROPPED IN THE BRACKEN AND BRAMBLE HE DISAPPEARED BUT
THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT TILL THE INSTANT OF HIS DEATH LIEUTCOLONEL
THE HON G MORRIS COMMANDING THE BATTALION RODE FROM ONE POINT
TO ANOTHER OF AN ACTION THAT WAS ALL FRONT CONTROLLING CHEERING
AND CHAFFING HIS MEN AND SO THAT HEATHEN BATTLE IN HALF DARKNESS
CONTINUED WITH ALL UNITS OF THE 4TH BRIGADE CONFUSEDLY ENGAGED
TILL IN THE AFTERNOON THE BATTALION COVERED BY THE 2ND COLDSTREAM
REFORMED STILL IN THE WOODS A MILE NORTH OF THE VILLAGE OF
PISSELEUX HERE THE ROLL WAS CALLED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE
FOLLOWING OFFICERS WERE MISSING LIEUTCOLONEL THE HON G MORRIS
MAJOR H F CRICHTON CAPTAIN C A TISDALL LIEUTENANT LORD ROBERT
INNESKER 2ND LIEUTENANT VISCOUNT CASTLEROSSE LIEUTENANT THE HON
AUBREY HERBERT AND LIEUTENANT SHIELDS RAMC

CAPTAIN LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD AND LIEUTENANT BLACKERDOUGLASS WERE
WOUNDED AND LEFT WITH THE FIELDAMBULANCE LIEUTCOLONEL MORRIS
MAJOR CRICHTON AND CAPTAIN TISDALL HAD BEEN KILLED THE OTHERS
HAD BEEN WOUNDED AND CAPTURED BY THE GERMANS WHO TREATED THEM WITH
REASONABLE HUMANITY AT VILLERSCOTTERTS TILL THEY WERE RELEASED ON
SEPTEMBER 12 BY THE FRENCH ADVANCE FOLLOWING THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE
MARNE COLONEL MORRISS BODY WAS AFTERWARDS IDENTIFIED AND BURIED
WITH THAT OF CAPTAIN TISDALL AND ONE LONG RUSTICFENCED GRAVE
PERHAPS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL RESTINGPLACES IN FRANCE ON A
SLOPE OF THE FOREST OFF THE DIM ROAD NEAR THE ROND DE LA REINE
HOLDS OUR DEAD IN THAT ACTION IT WAS MADE AND HAS BEEN RELIGIOUSLY
TENDED SINCE BY DR MOUFFLERS THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN AND HIS WIFE

THE DEATH OF COLONEL MORRIS AN OFFICER BELOVED AND A MAN NOTICEABLY
BRAVE AMONG BRAVE MEN WAS A HEAVY LOSS TO THE BATTALION HE
COMMANDED AND WHOSE TEMPER HE KNEW SO WELL IN THE THICK OF THE
FIGHT DURING A LULL IN THE FIRING WHEN SOME BLIND SHELLFIRE OPENED
HE CALLED TO THE MEN DYOU HEAR THAT THEYRE DOING THAT TO
FRIGHTEN YOU TO WHICH SOMEONE REPLIED WITH SIMPLE TRUTH IF THATS
WHAT THEYRE AFTER THEY MIGHT AS WELL STOP THEY SUCCEEDED WITH ME
HOURS AGO

AS A MATTER OF FACT THE MEN BEHAVED SERENELY AS MAY BE PROVED
BY THIS TALE THEY WERE WORKING THEIR WAY WELL UNDER RIFLEFIRE
ACROSS AN OPENING IN THE FOREST WHEN SOME OF THEM STOPPED TO PICK
BLACKBERRIES THAT ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION TO THESE THEIR SERGEANT
VERY DELIBERATELY SAID I SHOULDNT MIND THEM BERRIES LADS
THERES MAY BE WORRUMS IN EM IT WAS A SPEECH WORTHY OF A HERO
OF DUMAS WHOSE TOWN VILLERSCOTTERTS IS BY RIGHT OF BIRTH YET
ONCE DURING THEIR FURTHER RETIREMENT TOWARDS PISSELEUX THEY WERE
BADLY DISCONCERTED A CURIOUS PRIVATE PRODDED A HORNETS NEST ON A
BRANCH WITH HIS BAYONET AND THE INHABITANTS CAME OUT IN FORCE THEN
THERE WAS REAL CONFUSION NOT RESTORED BY THE SIGHT OF BALDHEADED
RESERVISTS FRANTICALLY SLAPPING WITH THEIR CAPS AT ONE HORNET WHILE
OTHERS STUNG THEM ON THEIR DEFENCELESS SCALPS SO THEY PASSED OUT OF
THE DARKNESS AND THE GREENERY OF THE FOREST WHICH FOUR YEARS LATER
WAS TO HIDE A GREAT FRENCH ARMY AND LAUNCH IT FORTH TO TURN THE
TIDE OF 1918

THEIR MARCH CONTINUED UNTIL 11 P M THAT NIGHT WHEN THE BATTALION
ARRIVED AT BETZ WHERE THE FIRST AND SECOND ARMY CORPS REJOINED
EACH OTHER ONCE MORE NO SUPPLIES WERE RECEIVED THAT NIGHT NOR THE
FOLLOWING DAY SEPTEMBER 2 WHEN THE BATTALION REACHED ESBLY WHERE
THEY BATHEDWITH SOAP BE IT NOTEDIN THE BROAD AND QUIET MARNE
AND AN OX WAS REQUISITIONED POTATOES WERE DUG UP FROM A FIELD AND
SOME SORT OF MEAL SERVED OUT

THE DIARY HERE NOTES THUS ENDED THE RETREAT FROM MONS THIS IS NOT
STRICTLY CORRECT IN TWELVE DAYS THE BRITISH ARMY HAD BEEN DRIVEN
BACK 140 MILES AS THE CROW FLIES FROM MONS AND FARTHER OF COURSE
BY ROAD THERE WAS YET TO BE A FURTHER RETIREMENT OF SOME FIFTEEN
MILES SOUTH OF ESBLY ERE THE GENERAL ADVANCE BEGAN BUT SEPTEMBER 3
MARKS AS NEARLY AS MAY BE SLACKWATER ERE THE EBB THAT FOLLOWED
OF THE TRIUMPHANT GERMAN TIDAL WAVE THROUGH BELGIUM ALMOST UP TO
THE OUTER FORTS OF PARIS THAT ADVANCE HAD AT THE LAST MOMENT
SWERVED ASIDE FROM PARIS TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST AND IN DOING SO HAD
PARTIALLY EXPOSED ITS RIGHT FLANK TO THE SIXTH FRENCH ARMY GENERAL
JOFFRE TOOK INSTANT ADVANTAGE OF THE FALSE STEP TO WHEEL HIS SIXTH
ARMY TO THE EAST SO THAT ITS LINE RAN DUE NORTH AND EAST FROM
ERMENONVILLE TO LAGNY AT THE SAME TIME THROWING FORWARD THE LEFT OF
HIS LINE THE BRITISH FORCE LAY BETWEEN LAGNY AND CORTECAN FILLING
THE GAP BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND FIFTH FRENCH ARMIES AND WAS STILL AN
EFFECTIVE WEAPON WHICH THE ENEMY SUPPOSED THEY HAD BROKEN FOR GOOD
BUT OUR HARRIED MEN REALIZED NO MORE THAN THAT FOR THE MOMENT THERE
SEEMED TO BE A PAUSE IN THE STEADY GOING BACK THE CONFUSION THE
DUST THE HEAT CONTINUED WHILE THE ARMIES MANUVRED FOR POSITION
AND SCOUTS AND AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE REPORTED MORE AND MORE GERMAN
COLUMNS OF ALL ARMS PRESSING DOWN FROM THE EAST AND NORTHEAST

ON SEPTEMBER 3 THE 4TH BRIGADE MOVED FROM ESBLY IN THE GREAT LOOPS
OF THE MARNE THROUGH MEAUX TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PIERRE LEVE
WHERE THE BATTALION FED ONCE MORE ON REQUISITIONED BEEF POTATOES
AND APPLES


THE ADVANCE TO THE AISNE

NEXT DAY SEPTEMBER 4 WHILE THE BRITISH ARMY WAS GETTING INTO
POSITION IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING FRONT TO THE RIGHT THE 4TH
BRIGADE HAD TO COVER A RETIREMENT OF THE 5TH BRIGADE BETWEEN PIERRE
LEVE AND LE BERTRAND AND THE BATTALION DUG ITSELF IN NEAR A FARM
GRAND LOGE ON THE PIERRE LEVEGIREMOUTIERS ROAD IN PREPARATION FOR
A REARGUARD ATTACK THAT DID NOT ARRIVE THEY REMAINED IN POSITION
WITH WHAT THE DIARY PATHETICALLY REFERS TO AS THE MACHINEGUN TILL
THEY WERE RELIEVED IN THE EVENING BY THE WORCESTERS AND REACHED
BIVOUAC AT LE BERTRAND AT ONE OCLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE 5TH
SEPTEMBER THAT DAY THEY BIVOUACKED NEAR FONTENAY AND PICKED UP SOME
MUCHNEEDED MESSTINS BOOTS PUTTIES AND THE LIKE WITH WHICH TO MAKE
GOOD MORE IMMEDIATE WASTE

ON THE 6TH THEY MARCHED THROUGH ROZOY WHERE THEY SAW AN OLD PRIEST
STANDING AT THE DOOR OF HIS CHURCH AND TO HIM THE MEN BARED THEIR
HEADS MECHANICALLY TILL HE OPENLY SURPRISED GAVE THEM HIS
BLESSING TO MONT PLAISIR TO GAIN TOUCH BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND
DIVISIONS OF THE ENGLISH ARMY MAJOR STEPNEY THE CO REPORTED TO
HEADQUARTERS 1ST BRIGADE AT 9 A M HALF A MILE NORTHEAST OF ROZOY
AT THE SAME MOMENT CAVALRY SCOUTS BROUGHT NEWS OF TWO ENEMY COLUMNS
ESTIMATED AT A THOUSAND EACH APPROACHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF
VAUDOY NOS 3 AND 4 COMPANIES WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO PROLONG THE
LINE OF THE FIRST DIVISION WHILE NOS 1 AND 2 COMPANIES WITH THE
MACHINEGUN ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES ON THE MONT PLAISIR ROAD

ARRIVED THAT DAY

THIS SMALL AFFAIR OF BOITRON WOOD WAS THE IRISH GUARDS SHARE OF THE
IMMENSE MIXED BATTLE OF THE MARNE NOW RAGING ALONG ALL THE FRONT
ITS RESULT AND THE CAPTURE OF THE MACHINEGUNS CHEERED THEM A LITTLE

THE NEXT FIVE DAYSSEPTEMBER 9 TO 13HAD NOTHING BUT TEDIOUS
MARCHING AND MORE TEDIOUS HALTS AND CHECKS DUE TO THE CONGESTION
OF TRAFFIC AND THE CHAOS IN THE VILLAGES THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED
SACKED DEFILED AND ABANDONED BY THE ENEMY THE MARNE WAS CROSSED
ON THE 9TH AT CHARLY WHERETHE INHABITANTS SAID THAT THE GERMANS
DETAILED FOR THE JOB HAD BEEN TOO DRUNK TO EFFECT ITA BRIDGE HAD
BEEN LEFT READY FOR DEMOLITION BUT INTACT AND BY THIS MEANS THE
FIRST AND SECOND DIVISIONS CROSSED THE RIVER THE WEATHER TURNED WET
WITH HEAVY SHOWERS GREATCOATS HAD BEEN LOST OR THROWN ASIDE ALL
ALONG THE LINE OF RETREAT BILLETS AND BIVOUACS MADE FILTHY BY THE
RETREATING GERMANS AND THERE WAS GENERAL DISCOMFORT ENLIVENED WITH
CONTINUOUS CANNONADING FROM THE FRONT AND THE APPEARANCE OF GERMAN
PRISONERS GATHERED IN BY OUR CAVALRY AHEAD AND THUS FROM THE MARNE
THE BATTALION CAME BY WAY OF TRENEL VILLERSSURMARNE COINTICOURT
OULCHYLECHTEAU COURCELLES AND ST MARD TO THE HIGH BANKS OF THE
AISNE WHICH THEY CROSSED BY THE PONTOON BRIDGE AT PONT DARCY ON THE
MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 14 AND ADVANCED TO SOUPIR IN THE HOLLOWS UNDER
THE STEEP WOODED HILLS

THAT DAY THE 2ND GRENADIERS FORMED THE ADVANCEGUARD OF THE
BRIGADE FOLLOWED BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM THE IRISH GUARDS AND THE
2ND COLDSTREAM AFTER THEY HAD CLEARED SOUPIR VILLAGE THE FORCE
WAS SHELLED AND AN ATTACK WAS MADE BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM THE IRISH
GUARDS IN SUPPORT ON A STEEP RIDGE NEAR LA COUR DE SOUPIR FARM
WHICH STOOD ON THE CREST OF THE BLUFF ABOVE THE RIVER THE HEAVILY
WOODED COUNTRY WAS ALIVE WITH MUSKETRY AND MACHINEGUN FIRE AND THE
DISTANCES WERE OBSCURED BY MIST AND HEAVY RAIN THE 3RD COLDSTREAM
ATTACKING THE FARM FOUND THEMSELVES OUTFLANKED FROM A RIDGE ON THEIR
RIGHT WHICH WAS THEN ATTEMPTED BY THREE COMPANIES OF THE IRISH
GUARDS THEY REACHED TO WITHIN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS OF A WOOD

ON THEIR RIGHT AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS ON THEIR LEFT HERE THOUGH
THEY DID NOT KNOW IT THE ADVANCE FROM THE MARNE WAS AT AN END OUR

SIDE AND DEEP ROADS HALF HIDDEN BY THE WOODS THAT CLIMBED THEM
THE PLATEAUX OF THE NORTH OF THE RIVER SHAPED THEMSELVES FOR THE
TRENCHWARFARE OF THE YEARS TO COME AND THE NATURAL STRENGTH OF THE

CAVES THAT RAN ALONG IT


THE HALT AT SOUPIR

ON THE 15TH SEPTEMBER PATROLS REPORTED THAT THE ENEMY HAD FALLEN BACK
A LITTLE FROM HIS POSITION AND AT DAYLIGHT TWO COMPANIES ENTRENCHED
THEMSELVES ON THE EDGE OF THE WOOD JUDGED BY PRESENT STANDARDS THOSE
TRENCHES WERE LITTLE MORE THAN SHALLOW FURROWS FOR WE DID NOT KNOW
THAT THE DAY OF OPEN BATTLE WAS ENDED AND IT IS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW
SLOWLY OUR PEOPLE BROKE THEMSELVES TO THE MONOTONOUS BUSINESS OF
TRENCH CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EVEN AFTER THEY HAD DUG THE
CASUAL DITCH WHICH THEY CALLED A TRENCH IT COST SOME TIME AND A FEW
LIVES TILL THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORKS COULD NOT BE APPROACHED IN
THE OPEN AS HAD BEEN WARS CUSTOM THEIR FIRST COMMUNICATIONTRENCH
WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED YARDS LONG AND IT STRUCK THEM AS A GIGANTIC
AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FATIGUE

THE ENEMY HAD NOT FALLEN BACK MORE THAN A THOUSAND YARDS FROM THE
COUR DE SOUPIR FARM WHICH THEY WERE RESOLUTE TO RETAKE IF POSSIBLE
THEY FIRED ON OUR BURYINGPARTIES AND SHELLED THE TRENCHES ALL
THROUGH THE 16TH SEPTEMBER PATROLS WERE SENT OUT AT DAWN AND
DUSKSINCE ANY ONE VISIBLE LEAVING THE TRENCHES WAS FIRED UPON BY
SNIPERSFOUND HOSTILE INFANTRY IN FULL STRENGTH IN FRONT OF THEM
AND THE BATTALION HAD TO ORGANIZE ITS FIRST SYSTEM OF TRENCHRELIEF
FOR THE DIARY OF THE 18TH SEPTEMBER REMARKS THAT NOS 1 AND 4
COMPANIES RELIEVED 2 AND 3 COMPANIES IN THE TRENCHES AND WERE AGAIN
SHELLED DURING THE DAY

SNIPING ON HUN LINES WAS A NOVEL EXPERIENCE TO THE BATTALION THEY
JUDGED IT STRANGE TO FIND A MAN APPARENTLY DEAD WITH A CLOTH OVER
HIS FACE LYING IN A HOLLOW UNDER A RIDGE COMMANDING THEIR LINE WHO
TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE ALIVE AND UNWOUNDED HIS RIFLE WAS WITHIN
SHORT REACH AND HE WAS WAITING TILL OUR PATROLS HAD PASSED TO GET TO
HIS WORK BUT THEY KILLED HIM ANGRILY AND WITH ASTONISHMENT

1 AND 4 ABOUT 300 YARDS IN THE REAR WITH THE HEADQUARTERS IN ONE OF
THE CAVES WHICH ARE A FEATURE OF THE COUNTRY THE WORD DUGOUT HAD
NOT YET BEEN INVENTED THE NEAREST APPROACH TO IT IS A REFERENCE IN
A PRIVATE LETTER TO A SHELTERRECESS IN THE SIDE OF THE TRENCH TO
PROTECT ONE FROM SHRAPNEL THE DIARY MARKS THAT THE USUAL ALARMS
OCCURRED AT 630 WHEN THE PATROL WENT OUT AND THE ENEMY FIRED A GOOD
DEAL OF SHRAPNEL WITHOUT EFFECT SOUPIR LIKE MANY FRENCH VILLAGES
WAS FULL OF CAREFULLY PLANTED SPIES OF SINGULAR AUDACITY ONE WAS
FOUND IN AN OFFICERS ROOM HE HAD APPEARED FROM A CELLAR ALLEGING
THAT HE WAS AN INVALID BUT AS THE GUNNERS TELEPHONEWIRES NEAR THE
CELLAR HAD BEEN CUT AND OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN REPORTED TO THE ENEMY
WITH GREAT REGULARITY HIS EXPLANATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED NOR WERE HIS
DAYS LONG IN THAT LAND

PATROLS TOO WERE ELASTIC AFFAIRS ONE OF THEM UNDER LIEUTENANT R
H FERGUSON WENT OUT ON THE NIGHT OF THE 21ST CAME ON THE ENEMYS
TRENCHES HALF A MILE OUT LAY DOWN TO LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION
THERE WERE ALL BUT CUT OFF BY A WANDERING SECTION OF SNIPERS AND
RETURNED TO THEIR LINES UNMOLESTED AFTER THE LIEUTENANT HAD SHOT THE
LEADING PURSUER WITH HIS REVOLVER

ON THE 22ND SEPTEMBER THE BATTALIONBOTH ENTRENCHED AND IN RESERVE
IN THE CAVES BEHINDEXPERIENCED FOUR HOURS HIGHEXPLOSIVE HOWITZER
FIRE WHICH EXCEPT FOR THE EFFECT ON THE NERVES DID VERY LITTLE
DAMAGE THEY HAD YET TO LEARN WHAT CONTINUOUS NOISE COULD DO TO
BREAK MENS NERVE THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A HEAVY FUSILLADE VARIED BY
STARSHELLS ROCKETS AND SEARCHLIGHTS WHICH LASTED INTERMITTENTLY
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE ROCKETDISPLAY WAS NEW TO THE MEN
SEARCHLIGHTS WE KNOW THEY HAD SEEN BEFORE

ON THE 23RD A TELEPHONELINE BETWEEN BATTALION HEADQUARTERS AND
THE ADVANCED TRENCHES WAS INSTALLED FOR THE FIRST TIME NOS 2
AND 3 COMPANIES RELIEVED NOS 1 AND 4 IN THE TRENCHES AND A MAN
BRINGING BACK A MESSAGE FROM NO 4 COMPANY WAS KILLED BY A SNIPER
THE BATTALION WAS RELIEVED BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM IN THE EVENING AND
RETURNED TO ITS BILLETS IN THE BARNS AND LOFTS OF SOUPIR VILLAGE
WHERE NEXT DAY SEPTEMBER 24 THE DIARY OBSERVES THEY SPENT A QUIET
MORNING THE MEN GOT WASHED AND SHAVED AND COMPANY OFFICERS WERE
ABLE TO GET AT THEIR COMPANIES THERE ARE SO MANY NEW OFFICERS WHO
DO NOT KNOW THEIR MEN THAT ANY REST DAY SHOULD BE MADE USE OF IN
THIS MANNER THEY RELIEVED THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AGAIN THAT EVENING
AND DIGGING OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE EXISTING TRENCHES AND MAKE
COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES WERE AT ONCE BEGUN HERE IS THE FIRST DIRECT
REFERENCE IN THE DIARY TO COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES AS SUCH

SNIPERS WERE ACTIVE ALL THROUGH THE 25TH SEPTEMBER THE TRENCHES WERE
HEAVILY SHELLED IN THE AFTERNOON AND ONE MAN WAS HIT IN THE LEG
WHILE GOING TO FETCH WATER THEY RETURNED TO SOUPIR IN THE EVENING
AND SPENT THE 26TH STANDING TO IN ANTICIPATION OF ENEMY ATTACKS
WHICH DID NOT DEVELOP INTO ANYTHING MORE THAN AN ARTILLERY DUEL AND
IN DIGGING TRENCHES FOR THE DEFENCE OF SOUPIR VILLAGE THIS WORK
HOWEVER HAD TO BE STOPPED OWING TO HEAVY SHELLFIRE BROUGHT TO BEAR
ON THE WORKINGPARTIESPRESUMABLY THROUGH INFORMATION FROM THE MANY
SPIESAND AFTER A WEARING DAY RELIEVED THE 3RD COLDSTREAM IN THE
TRENCHES AT NIGHT THE DIARY GIVES NO HINT OF THE TREMENDOUS STRAIN
OF THOSE TWENTYFOUR HOURS RELIEFS FROM BEING SHELLED IN A TRENCH
TO BEING SHELLED IN A VILLAGE NOR OF THE INADEQUACY OF OUR ARTILLERY
AS IT STROVE TO COPE WITH THE GERMAN GUNS NOR OF THE RASPING
IRRITATION CAUSED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT EVERY DISPOSITION MADE WAS
REPORTED ALMOST AT ONCE TO THE ENEMY

ON SEPTEMBER 27A SUNDAYTHE ENEMYS BANDS WERE HEARD PLAYING UP
AND DOWN THE TRENCHES SOME ATTEMPT WAS MADE BY A BRITISH BATTALION
ON THE RIGHT TO MOVE OUT A PATROL COVERED BY THE FIRE OF NO 2
COMPANY BUT THE ENEMY SHELLS AND MACHINEGUNS SMOTHERED EVERY
MOVEMENT

ON THE 28TH SEPTEMBER THEIR DAY IN BILLETS STAKES WERE CUT OUT OF
THE WOODS BEHIND SOUPIR WHILE THE PIONEERS COLLECTED WHAT WIRE THEY
COULD LAY HANDS ON AS THE BATTALION WAS ORDERED TO CONSTRUCT WIRE
ENTANGLEMENTS IN FRONT OF THEIR TRENCHES TONIGHT THE ENTANGLEMENTS
WERE MADE OF TWO OR THREE STRANDS AT THE MOST OF AGRICULTURAL
WIRE PICKED UP WHERE THEY COULD FIND IT THEY HEARD HEAVY FIGHTING
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ON THEIR RIGHTPROBABLY THE FIRST DIVISION
BOTH SIDES BY NOW WERE FEELING THE STRAIN OF TRENCHWORK FOR WHICH
NEITHER HAD MADE PREPARATIONS AND THE RESULT WAS AN INCREASING
TENSION MANIFESTING ITSELF IN WILD OUTBURSTS OF MUSKETRY AND
ARTILLERY AND CAMP RUMOUR OF MASSED ATTACKS AND BREAKSTHROUGH

ON THE 30TH SEPTEMBER FM LORD ROBERTSS BIRTHDAY A
CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAM WAS SENT TO HIM AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF
MATERIAL WAS COLLECTED OUT OF WHICH HUTS FOR THE MEN COULD BE BUILT
THESE WERE FRAIL AFFAIRS OF STRAW AND TWIG HALF DUG IN HALF BUILT
OUT OF THE NEAREST BANKS OR PLACED UNDER THE LEE OF ANY AVAILABLE
SHELTER THE VERY FABRIC OF THEM HAS LONG SINCE BEEN OVERLAID WITH
STRATA OF FRESH WRECKAGE AND THE TWIG ROOFS AND SIDES ARE ROTTED
BLACK UNDER THE GRASS OR PLOUGHED IN

THE MONTH CLOSES WITH THE NOTE THAT AS IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT
MOONLIGHT NIGHT THE BATTALIONS USUAL RELIEF OF THE COLDSTREAM WAS
CARRIED OUT UP THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES SOME MEN STILL RECALL
THAT FIRST CLUMSY TRENCHRELIEF

OCTOBER 1 WAS SPENT IN PERFECTING COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES AND
SHELTERS AND THE BRIGADIER CAME UP IN THE MORNING AND WAS TAKEN
ROUND THE TRENCHES TWO OFFICERS WERE SENT TO CHAVONNE TO MEET THE
5TH BRIGADEONE TO BRING THE WORCESTERS TO THE BATTALIONS TRENCHES
THE OTHER TO SHOW THE CONNAUGHT RANGERS THEIR BILLETS IN SOUPIR THE
3RD COLDSTREAM MARCHED OUT OF SOUPIR AND TOOK UP THE LINE TO THE LEFT
OF THE 2ND GRENADIERS NEAR VAILLY AND NEXT DAY 2ND OCTOBER NO 1
COMPANY OF THE IRISH GUARDS DUG A CONNECTINGTRENCH BETWEEN THOSE
TWO OTHERWISE FOR THE MOMENT LIFE WAS SMOOTH

IT MAY BE NOTED FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF GENERATIONS TO COME THAT
SOME OF THE RESERVISTS GRUMBLED AT ORDERS NOT TO TALK OR SMOKE
IN THE TRENCHES AS THAT DREW FIRE AND THAT A NEWLY APPOINTED
PLATOONOFFICER WHEN HE HAD ADMONISHED THEM OFFICIALLY FELL THEM
OUT AND INFORMED THEM UNOFFICIALLY THAT WERE THERE ANY MORE TROUBLE
HE WOULD AFTER THE CO HAD DEALT WITH THE OFFENDERS TAKE THEM ON
FOR THREE ROUNDS BOXING IN PUBLIC PEACE AND GOODWILL RETURNED AT
ONCE

ON THE 3RD OCTOBER A PLATOON WAS DESPATCHED TO HELP THE ROYAL
ENGINEERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A ROAD ACROSS A NEW BRIDGE THEY
HAD PUT UP BETWEEN SOUPIR AND CHAVONNE THE BATTALION RELIEVED THE
3RD COLDSTREAM IN ITS NEW POSITION THREEQUARTERS OF A MILE EAST
OF VAILLY AND NEXT DAY QUIETLY IMPROVED TRENCHES AND HEADCOVER
WHICH LATTER IS MENTIONED FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS ALL CASUAL
TIMBER PICKED UP OFF THE COUNTRYSIDE

ON THE 5TH OCTOBER A PATROL EXPLORED THROUGH THE WOOD IN FRONT OF
THE RIGHT TRENCHES BUT FOUND ONLY DEAD GERMANS TO THE NUMBER OF
THIRTY AND MANY HALF BURIED AS WELL AS FIVE BRITISH SOLDIERS KILLED
IN SOME LOST AFFAIR OF A FORTNIGHT BEFORE PRIVATE OSHAUGHNESSY
NO 1 COMPANY WAS SHOT DEAD BY A SNIPER WHEN ON OBSERVATIONPOST
AT THE END OF THIS WOOD HE HAD ONLY ARRIVED THAT MORNING WITH A
DRAFT OF ONE HUNDRED MEN UNDER LIEUTENANT GORELANGTON AND HAD
ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO GO OUT ON THIS DUTY IN THE AFTERNOON THREE
SHELLS BURST ON THE ROAD NEAR BATTALION HEADQUARTERS AND FATALLY
WOUNDED LIEUTENANT G BROOKE WHO WAS ON HIS WAY TO SOUPIR TO TAKE
OVER THE TRANSPORT FROM LIEUTENANT E J GOUGH HE WAS SENT IN TO
BRAISNE WHERE HE DIED ON THE 7TH OCTOBER THE DIARY NOTES HE
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND SO SOON HAD NOT THE SHELLS BROKEN THE
TELEPHONEWIRE TO HEADQUARTERS A MESSAGE WAS COMING THROUGH AT THE
TIME AND WHEN COMMUNICATION WAS STOPPED THE SIGNALLING SERGEANT
SENT TWO MEN TO REPAIR THE WIRE AND THEY FOUND HIM HE WAS BROUGHT
IN TO THE ADS AT VAILLYSURAISNE BY HIS OWN MEN WHO MADE THE
RAMC STRETCHERBEARERS WALK BEHIND AS THEY WOULD ALLOW NONE BUT
THEMSELVES TO CARRY HIM THEY BADE HIM FAREWELL BEFORE THEY RETURNED
TO THEIR TRENCHES AND WENT OUT OPENLY WEEPING WHEN HE WAS SENT TO
BRAISNE THAT EVENING AFTER BEING DRESSED HIS OWN MEN AGAIN GOT AN
AMBULANCE ACROSS THE PONTOONBRIDGE WHICH HAD BEEN HITHERTO RECKONED
IMPASSABLE FOR HIS CONVENIENCE HIS LAST WORDS TO THEM WERE THAT
THEY WERE TO PLAY THE GAME AND NOT TO REVENGE HIS DEATH ON THE HUN

ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 6TH OCTOBER WHICH WAS COLD AND MISTY THE
GERMANS PUSHED A PATROL THROUGH THE WOOD AND OUR STANDINGPATROL WENT
OUT AND DISCOVERED ONE GERMAN UNDEROFFICER OF THE 64TH IMPERIAL
JGER GUARDS DEAD AND THE RIFLE OF ANOTHER MAN

THE ENEMY SENT OUT NO MORE PATROLS MEN HAD GROWN TO BE CUNNING
AMONG THE TIMBER AND NOTICED EVERY TREE THEY MOVED UNDER WHEN THE
COLDSTREAM RELIEVED THE BATTALION THAT NIGHT ONE OF OUR PATROLS
FOUND A FELLED TREE HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PLACED ACROSS THEIR HOMEWARD
PATH BY SOME UNKNOWN HANDIT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LATE JGER
UNDEROFFICERWHO HAD EXPECTED TO ATTACK THE PATROL WHILE IT WAS
CLIMBING OVER THE OBSTACLE

ON THE 7TH THE BATTALION RESTED IN SOUPIR ALL DAY AND ON THE 8TH
LIEUTENANT G BROOKES BODY WAS BROUGHT IN FROM BRAISNE AND BURIED IN
SOUPIR CEMETERY

THE 9TH WAS A QUIET DAY EXCEPT FOR AN HOURS SHELLING AND A GOOD
DEAL OF CHEERING FROM THE GERMAN TRENCHES IN THE EVENING EVIDENTLY
IN HONOUR OF THE FALL OF ANTWERP IT ANNOYED OUR MEN FOR THE REASON
THAT THEY COULD NOT RETALIATE OUR GUNS HAD NOT A ROUND TO THROW AWAY


THE MOVE TOWARD THE SEA

THE OPPOSING LINES HAD BEEN LOCKED NOW FOR CLOSE UPON A MONTH AND
AS DEFENCES ELABORATED THEMSELVES ALL HOPE OF BREAKINGTHROUGH
VANISHED BOTH SIDES THEN OPENED THAT MUTUALLY OUTFLANKING MOVEMENT
TOWARDS THE WEST WHICH DID NOT END TILL IT REACHED THE SEA HELD UP
ALONG THEIR MAIN FRONT THE GERMANS STRUCK AT THE FLANDERS PLAIN THE
ALLIES STRIVING TO MEET THE MOVEMENT AND ENVELOP THEIR RIGHT FLANK AS
IT EXTENDED A BRITISH FORCE HAD BEEN SENT TO ANTWERP THE SEVENTH
DIVISION AND THE THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION HAD BEEN LANDED AT ZEEBRUGGE
ON THE 7TH OCTOBER WITH THE IDEA OF HELPING EITHER THE ANTWERP FORCE
OR COOPERATING WITH THE ALLIED ARMIES AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATED
MEANTIME THE MAIN BRITISH FORCE WAS BEING HELD IN THE TRENCHES OF
THE AISNE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AWAY AND IT SEEMED GOOD TO
ALL CONCERNED THAT THESE TWO BODIES OF BRITISH TROOPS SHOULD BE
CONSOLIDATED BOTH FOR PURPOSES OF OFFENCE COMMAND AND BY NO MEANS
LEAST SUPPLY ON THE FLANDERS FLANK COVERING THE CHANNEL THERE
WERE OBVIOUS DANGERS IN MOVING SO MANY MEN FROM HIGH GROUND ACROSS A
BROAD RIVER UNDER THE ENEMYS EYE IT COULD ONLY BE EFFECTED AT NIGHT
WITH ALL PRECAUTIONS BUT AS THE WESTERN PRESSURE DEVELOPED AND WAS
ACCENTUATED BY THE FALL OF ANTWERP THE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRANSFER
OUTWEIGHED ALL RISK OUR CAVALRY MOVED ON THE 3RD OCTOBER BY ROAD
FOR FLANDERS AND A FEW DAYS LATER THE INFANTRY BEGAN TO ENTRAIN FOR
ST OMER THE SECOND CORPS WAS THE FIRST TO LEAVE THE THIRD CORPS
FOLLOWED AND THE FIRST WAS THE LAST

ORDERS CAME TO THE BATTALION ON SUNDAY OCTOBER 11 TO BE PREPARED
TO MOVE AT SHORT NOTICE AND NEW CLOTHES WERE ISSUED TO THE MEN BUT
THEY DID NOT HAND OVER THEIR TRENCHES TO THE FRENCH TILL THE 13TH
OCTOBER WHEN THEY MARCHED TO PERLES IN THE EVENING AND ENTRAINED ON
THE 14TH AT FISMES A LITTLE AFTER NOON REACHING HAZEBROUCK VIA
THE ROUTE IS WORTH RECORDING MAREUILSUROURCQ ORMOY ST DENIS

A M ETAPLES BOULOGNE CALAIS AND ST OMER EVERY STONE OF WHICH
LAST SIX WAS TO BE AS FAMILIAR TO THEM AS THEIR OWN HEARTHS FOR YEARS
TO COME

AT 5 P M ON THE 15TH THE BATTALION WENT INTO BILLETS AT HAZEBROUCK
IT WAS A SHARP CHANGE FROM THE SOFT WOODED BLUFFS AND CLEAN CHALKY
HILLS ABOVE THE AISNE TO THE SLOW DITCHLIKE STREAMS AND CROWDED
FARMING LANDSCAPE OF FLANDERS AT HAZEBROUCK THEY LAY TILL THE
MORNING OF THE 17TH WHEN THEY MARCHED TO BOESCHEPE ATTENDED CHURCH
PARADE ON SUNDAY THE 18TH AND MARCHED TO UNTOUCHED YPRES VIA ST
KOKEBEELE RENINGHELST AND VLAMERTINGHE ON THE 20TH WITH THE BRIGADE
SOME DIVISIONAL TROOPS AND THE 41ST BATTERY RFA THE BRIGADE
HALTED AT YPRES A FEW HOURS SEEING AND BEING IMPRESSED BY THE BEAUTY
OF THE CLOTH HALL AND THE CROWDED MARKETPLACE THE 2ND COLDSTREAM
AND THE 2ND BATTALION GRENADIERS BEING EVENTUALLY SENT FORWARD
THE REMAINDER OF THE BRIGADE BILLETED IN ST JEAN THEN DESCRIBED
IMPERSONALLY AS A SMALL VILLAGE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF KILOMETRES EAST
OF YPRES THEY HALTED AT THE EDGE OF THE CITY FOR DINNER AND THE
MEN GOT OUT THEIR MELODEONS AND DANCED JIGS ON THE FLAWLESS PAV
MUCH FIRING WAS HEARD ALL DAY AND THE 2ND COLDSTREAM CAME INTO
ACTION ABOUT 4 P M AND REMAINED IN THE TRENCHES ALL NIGHT

THAT WAS THE SUM OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT TO THE
BATTALIONTHAT AND ORDERS TO DRIVE THE ENEMY BACK WHEREVER
MET SO THEY FIRST WERE INTRODUCED TO THE STAGE OF THE BLOODY AND
DEBATABLE LAND WHICH WILL BE KNOWN FOR ALL TIME AS THE SALIENT

THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OF OUR ARMY ON THE FLANDERS FLANK HAD BEEN
OFFENSIVE BUT THE LONG CHECK ON THE AISNE GAVE THE ENEMY TIME TO
BRING FORWARD TROOPS FROM THEIR IMMENSE AND PERFECTLY PREPARED
RESERVES WHILE THE FALL OF ANTWERPSMALL WONDER THE GERMANS HAD
CHEERED IN THEIR TRENCHES WHEN THE NEWS CAMERELEASED MORE
CONSEQUENTLY THE MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN ON THE ALLIES SIDE AS AN
ATTEMPT TO ROLL UP THE GERMAN RIGHT FLANK BEFORE IT COULD REACH THE
SEA ENDED IN A DESPERATE DEFENCE TO HOLD BACK AN OVERWHELMINGLY
STRONG ENEMY FROM SWEEPING FORWARD THROUGH BELGIUM TO CALAIS AND THE
FRENCH SEABOARD OUT OF THIS DEFENCE DEVELOPED THAT IMMENSE AND
OVERLAPPING SERIES OF OPERATIONS CENTRING ON YPRES EXTENDING FROM
THE YSER CANAL IN THE NORTH TO LA BASSE IN THE SOUTH AND LASTING
FROM MIDOCTOBER TO THE 20TH NOVEMBER 1914 WHICH MAY BE RANKED AS
THE FIRST BATTLE OF YPRES

IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE SECOND AND THIRD BRITISH ARMY CORPS
WERE THE FIRST TO LEAVE THE AISNE TRENCHES FOR THE WEST ON THE 11TH
OCTOBER THE SECOND ARMY CORPS WAS IN POSITION BETWEEN THE AIRE AND
BTHUNE AND IN TOUCH WITH THE LEFT FLANK OF THE TENTH FRENCH ARMY AT
LA BASSE

ON THE 12TH OF OCTOBER THE THIRD ARMY CORPS REACHED ST OMER AND
MOVED FORWARD TO HAZEBROUCK TO GET TOUCH WITH THE SECOND ARMY CORPS
ON ITS RIGHT THE IDEA BEING THAT THE TWO CORPS TOGETHER SHOULD WHEEL
ON THEIR OWN LEFT AND STRIKING EASTWARD TURN THE POSITION OF THE
GERMAN FORCES THAT WERE FACING THE TENTH FRENCH ARMY THEY FAILED
OWING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE GERMAN FORCES ON THE SPOT AND BY
OCTOBER 19 AFTER INDESCRIBABLY FIERCE FIGHTING THE SECOND AND THIRD
ARMY CORPS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL ON A LINE FROM LA BASSE
THROUGH ARMENTIRES NOT NOTICEABLY DIFFERING FROM THE POSITION WHICH
OUR FORCES WERE DESTINED TO OCCUPY FOR MANY MONTHS TO COME THE
ATTEMPTED FLANK ATTACKS HAD BECOME FRONTAL ALL ALONG THE LINE AND IN
DUE COURSE FRONTAL ATTACKS SOLIDIFIED INTO TRENCHWARFARE AGAIN

NORTH OF ARMENTIRES THE SITUATION HAD SETTLED ITSELF IN MUCH THE
SAME FASHION FLANK ATTACKS BEING OUTFLANKED BY THE EXTENSION OF THE
ENEMYS LINE WITH STRENUOUS FRONTAL ATTACKS OF HIS DAILY INCREASING
FORCES

THE SEVENTH DIVISIONTHE FIRST HALF OF THE FOURTH ARMY
CORPSREACHED YPRES FROM DIXMUDE ON THE 14TH OCTOBER AFTER ITS
UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO RELIEVE ANTWERP AS THE FIRST ARMY CORPS HAD
NOT YET COME UP FROM THE AISNE THIS DIVISION WAS USED TO COVER THE
BRITISH POSITION AT YPRES FROM THE NORTH THE INFANTRY LYING FROM
ZANDVOORDE ON THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH ZONNEBEKE TO LANGEMARCK ON
THE NORTHWEST HERE AGAIN THROUGH LACK OF NUMBERS AND ARTILLERY
EQUIPMENT THE BRITISH POSITION WAS AS SERIOUS AS IN THE SOUTH ENEMY
FORCES MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE BRITISH AND BELGIAN ARMIES COMBINED
WERE BEARING DOWN ON THE BRITISH LINE FROM THE EASTWARD THROUGH
COURTRAI ISEGHEM AND ROULERS AND OVER THE LYS BRIDGE AT MENIN
LATER ON IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THESE REPRESENTED NOT LESS THAN FIVE
NEW ARMY CORPS THE SEVENTH DIVISION WAS ORDERED TO MOVE UPON MENIN
TO SEIZE THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER AND THUS CHECK THE ADVANCE OF
FURTHER REINFORCEMENTS THERE WERE OF COURSE NOT ENOUGH TROOPS FOR
THE WORK BUT ON THE 18TH OCTOBER THE DIVISION THE RIGHT CENTRE OF
WHICH RESTED ON THE YPRESMENIN ROAD NOT YET LINED THROUGHOUT WITH
DEAD WHEELED ITS LEFT THE 22ND BRIGADE FORWARD AS THE ADVANCE
BEGAN THE CAVALRY ON THE LEFT BECAME AWARE OF A LARGE NEW GERMAN
FORCE ON THE LEFT FLANK OF THE ADVANCE AND FIGHTING BECAME GENERAL
ALL ALONG THE LINE OF THE DIVISION

ON THE 19TH OCTOBER THE AIRMEN REPORTED THE PRESENCE OF TWO FRESH
ARMY CORPS ON THE LEFT NO FURTHER ADVANCE BEING POSSIBLE THE
DIVISION WAS ORDERED TO FALL BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL LINE AN OPERATION
ATTENDED WITH HEAVY LOSS UNDER CONSTANT ATTACKS

ON THE 20TH OCTOBER THE PRESSURE INCREASED AS THE GERMAN ARMY CORPS
MADE THEMSELVES FELT AGAINST THE THIN LINE HELD BY THE SEVENTH
DIVISION WHICH WAS NOT AMPLY PROVIDED WITH HEAVY BATTERIES
THEIR LOSSES WERE LARGELY DUE TO ARTILLERY FIRE DIRECTED BY
AIROBSERVATION THAT OBLITERATED TRENCHES MEN AND MACHINEGUNS

ON THE 21ST OCTOBER THE ENEMY ATTACKED THE DIVISION THROUGHOUT THE
DAY ARTILLERY PREPARATIONS BEING VARIED BY MASS ASSAULTS BUT STILL
THE DIVISION ENDURED IN THE FACE OF AN ENEMY AT LEAST FOUR TIMES
AS STRONG AND CONSTANTLY REINFORCED IT IS AS ONE WRITER SAYS
HARDLY CONCEIVABLE THAT OUR MEN COULD HAVE CHECKED THE ENEMYS
ADVANCE FOR EVEN A DAY LONGER HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRIVAL AT
THIS JUNCTURE OF THE FIRST ARMY CORPS REINFORCEMENTS WERE URGENTLY
NEEDED AT EVERY POINT OF THE BRITISH LINE BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE
IMMINENT DANGER LAY TO THE NORTH OF YPRES WHERE FRESH GERMAN FORCES
UNDERESTIMATED AS USUAL MIGHT SWEEP THE BELGIAN ARMY ASIDE AND
ENTER THE CHANNEL PORTS IN OUR REAR WITH THIS IN MIND THE BRITISH
COMMANDERINCHIEF DECIDED TO USE THE FIRST ARMY CORPS TO PROLONG THE
BRITISH LINE ALREADY AS IT SEEMED NEARLY WORN THROUGH TOWARD THE
SEA RATHER THAN TO STRENGTHEN ANY OCCUPIED SECTOR HE POSTED IT
THEREFOREUNTIL FRENCH REINFORCEMENTS SHOULD ARRIVETO THE NORTH
OR LEFT OF THE SEVENTH DIVISION FROM ZONNEBEKE TO BIXSCHOOTE

OUR FRONT AT THAT DATE RAN FROM HOLLEBEKE TO BIXSCHOOTE A DISTANCE
ALLOWING FOR BENDS OF SOME SIXTEEN MILES TO PROTECT THIS WE HAD BUT
THREE DEPLETED INFANTRY DIVISIONS AND TWO CAVALRY BRIGADES AGAINST
OPPOSED FORCES OF NOT LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND MOREOVER THE
GROUND WAS HAMPERED BY THE FLIGHT FROM ROULERS AND VILLAGES IN
GERMAN POSSESSION OF REFUGEES OF WHOM A PERCENTAGE WERE CERTAINLY
SPIES BUT OVER WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXERCISE ANY CONTROL THEY
CARRIED THEIR GOODS IN LITTLE CARTS DRAWN BY DOGS AND THEY WEPT AND
WAILED AS THEY STRAGGLED PAST OUR MEN


THE SALIENT AND THE FIRST BATTLE OF YPRES

THE ORDERS FOR THE GUARDS BRIGADE ON OCTOBER 21 TO DRIVE BACK THE
ENEMY WHEREVER MET WERE NOT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE ALL THEIR NEWS
IN BILLETS HAD BEEN OF FRESH FORMATIONS COMING DOWN FROM THE NORTH
AND THE EAST AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GERMANS COUNTED WITH
CONFIDENCE UPON ENTERING CALAIS VIA YPRES IN A FEW DAYS

THE BRIGADE LESS THE 2ND COLDSTREAM ASSEMBLED IN A FIELD ABOUT
FOUR KILOMETRES ALONG THE YPRESZONNEBEKE ROAD AND AFTER A WAIT
OF THREE HOURS NO 4 COMPANY OF THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS ADVANCED TO
THE SUPPORT OF THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED TO PROLONG
THE LINE TO THE RIGHT OF THE 2ND COLDSTREAM THIS COMPANY AND BOTH
THE ADVANCED BATTALIONS SUFFERED SOMEWHAT SEVERELY FROM SHELLFIRE
AND OCCASIONAL SNIPING THUS COLDLY DOES THE DIARY ENTER UPON
WHAT WAS IN FACT THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST BATTLE OF YPRES IN
WHICH COMPANIES HAD TO DO THE WORK OF BATTALIONS AND BATTALIONS OF
BRIGADES AND WHOSE ONLY RELIEF WAS A CHANGE OF TORN AND BLOODSOAKED
GROUND FROM ONE THREATENED SECTOR OF THE LINE TO THE NEXT

IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO RECORD HOW THE PEOPLE OF YPRES BROUGHT HOT
COFFEE TO THE BATTALION AS IT PASSED THROUGH THE DAY BEFORE OCTOBER
20 AND HOW WHEN THEY HALTED THERE A FEW HOURS THE MEN AMUSED
THEIR HOSTS BY AGAIN DANCING IRISH JIGS ON THE CLATTERING PAVEMENTS
WHILE THE REFUGEES CLATTERED PAST OR HOW IT WAS NECESSARY TO WARN
THE COMPANIES THAT THE ENEMY MIGHT ATTACK BEHIND A SCREEN OF BELGIAN
WOMEN AND CHILDRENIN WHICH CASE THE BATTALION WOULD HAVE TO FIRE
THROUGH THEM

ON THE EVENING OF THE 21ST OCTOBER THE BATTALION WAS ORDERED UP TO
THE SUPPORT OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE 22ND BRIGADE WHICH HAD FALLEN
BACK TO ZONNEBEKE IT CAME UNDER A HEAVY BURST OF ARTILLERY
FIRE AND WAS FORCED TO LIE DOWN IN A PLOUGHED FIELD FOR FIFTEEN
MINUTESAT THAT TIME A NOVEL EXPERIENCE ON ITS WAY A HARE STARTED
UP WHICH WAS CAPTURED BY A MAN OF NO 2 COMPANY TO THE SCANDAL OF
DISCIPLINE AND THE DELIGHT OF ALL AND LATER SOLD FOR FIVE SHILLINGS
AT ZONNEBEKE IT FOUND NO 4 COMPANY ALREADY LINING THE MAIN ROAD ON
THE LEFT OF THE TOWN AND TOOK UP A POSITION IN EXTENDED ORDER ON ITS
RIGHT THUS ESTABLISHING THE LINE INTO ZONNEBEKE THE CASUALTIES
IN SPITE OF THE ARTILLERY FIRE ARE NOTED AS ONLY ONE KILLED AND
SEVEN WOUNDED WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN FAR UNDER THE MARK THE NIGHT
WAS LIT BY THE FLAMES OF BURNING HOUSES BY WHICH LIGHT THEY HUNTED
FOR SNIPERS IN HAYSTACKS ROUND THE VILLAGE BURIED STRAY DEAD OF A
BATTALION OF THE SEVENTH DIVISION WHICH HAD LEFT THEM AND BY ORDER
DID A DEAL OF FUTILE DIGGINGIN

THE NEXT DAY THE 22ND BRIGADE RETIRED OUT OF ZONNEBEKE ABOUT A
KILOMETRE DOWN THE MAIN ROAD TO YPRES THE BATTALION AND HALF THE
2ND COLDSTREAM CONFORMING TO THE MOVEMENT THIS ENABLED THE GERMANS
TO ENTER THE NORTH OF ZONNEBEKE AND POST MACHINEGUNS IN SOME OF THE
HOUSES NONE THE LESS OUR PATROLS REMAINED IN THE SOUTH END OF THE
TOWN AND DID EXCELLENT WORK AN OFFICERS PATROL UNDER LIEUTENANT
FERGUSON CAPTURING THREE MOUNTED ORDERLIES ONE MAN WAS KILLED AND
8 WOUNDED IN THE BATTALION THAT DAY

ON THE 23RD OCTOBER THE ENEMY BROUGHT UP MORE MACHINEGUNS AND
USED THEM AGAINST US ENERGETICALLY ALL THE DAY A PLATOON OF NO
1 COMPANY UNDER LIEUTENANT THE HON H ALEXANDER ATTEMPTED AN
OUTFLANKING MOVEMENT THROUGH ZONNEBEKE TOWARDS THE CHURCH SUPPORTED
BY A PLATOON OF NO 4 COMPANY UNDER LIEUTENANT W C N REYNOLDS
IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THE LATTER OFFICER WAS WOUNDED THE TRENCHES
WERE SHELLED WITH SHRAPNEL ALL THE AFTERNOON AND A GERMAN ADVANCE
WAS SPRAYED DOWN WITH OUR RIFLEFIRE IN THE EVENING THE FRENCH MADE
AN ATTACK THROUGH ZONNEBEKE HELPED BY THEIR 75S AND ESTABLISHED
THEMSELVES IN THE TOWN THEY ALSO AT 9 P M RELIEVED THE BATTALION
WHICH MOVED AT ONCE SOUTHWEST TO ZILLEBEKE AND ARRIVED THERE AT
2 A M ON THE MORNING OF THE 24TH WHEN IT BILLETED CHIEFLY IN A
BRICKYARD READY TO BE USED AFRESH

THE RELIEVING TROOPS WERE A DIVISION OF THE NINTH FRENCH ARMY
CORPS THEY TOOK OVER THE LINE OF OUR SECOND DIVISION WHILE OUR
SECOND DIVISION IN TURN TOOK OVER PART OF THE FRONT OF THE SEVENTH
DIVISION AT THE SAME TIME FRENCH TERRITORIALS RELIEVED OUR FIRST
DIVISION BETWEEN BIXSCHOOTE AND LANGEMARCK THUS FREEING US OF ALL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY GROUND NORTH OF THE YPRESZONNEBEKE ROAD OUR
ARMY ON THE 24TH OCTOBER THEN STOOD AS FOLLOWS FROM THE ZONNEBEKE
ROAD TO A POINT NEAR THE RACECOURSE IN THE HISTORIC POLYGON WOOD
WEST OF REUTEL WAS THE SECOND DIVISION ON ITS RIGHT UP TO THE MENIN
ROAD LAY THE FIRST DIVISION AND FROM THE MENIN ROAD TO ZANDVOORDE
THE SEVENTH DIVISION WITH THE 3RD CAVALRY BRIGADE IN THE ZANDVOORDE
TRENCHES OUR LINE HAD THUS BEEN SHORTENED AND STRENGTHENED BUT THE
ENEMY WERE CONTINUOUSLY RECEIVING REINFORCEMENTS FROM ROULERS AND
MENIN AND THE PRESSURE NEVER CEASED

IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE 24TH OCTOBER AND BEFORE THE TRANSFER
OF ALL THE TROOPS HAD BEEN EFFECTED THE BRITISH YPRES FRONT WAS
ATTACKED THROUGHOUT IN FORCE AND ONCE MORE THE SHOCK OF THE ATTACK
FELL ON THE REMAINS OF THE SEVENTH DIVISION RESERVES THERE WERE
NONE EACH BATTALION STOOD WHERE IT WAS IN THE FLOOD AND FOUGHT ON
FRONT FLANK AND REAR INDIFFERENTLY THE IRISH GUARDS HAD A FEW
HOURS REST IN THE BRICKFIELDS AT ZILLEBEKE WHERE BY SOME MIRACLE
IT FOUND ITS MAIL OF HOMELETTERS AND PARCELS WAITING FOR IT EVEN
BEFORE IT COULD OPEN THEM IT WAS ORDERED OUT FROM ZILLEBEKE2 ALONG
THE YPRESMENIN ROAD TO HOOGE TO HELP THE 20TH BRIGADE SEVENTH
DIVISION WHICH HAD BEEN ATTACKED ON THE MORNING OF THE 25TH
OCTOBER AND PARTIES OF THE ENEMY WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BROKEN
THROUGH INTO POLYGON WOOD

THAT ATTACK HOWEVER WAS REPULSED DURING THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING
THE BATTALION WAS DESPATCHED TO ACT IN SUPPORT OF THE 5TH BRIGADE
NEAR RACECOURSE POLYGON WOOD DUE NORTH OF VELDHOEK WHERE THE
BATTALION BIVOUACKED FOR THE NIGHT IN A PLOUGHED FIELD THIS WAS THE
FIRST TIME IT HAD MARCHED UP THE MENIN ROAD OR SEEN THE CHTEAU OF
HOOGE OF WHICH NOW NO TRACE REMAINS SITTING STATELY AMONG ITS LAWNS

ON THE 25TH OCTOBER AFTER A HEAVY BOMBARDMENT AS BOMBARDMENTS WERE
THEN RECKONED THE WHOLE DIVISION WAS ORDERED AT DAWN TO ADVANCE
AGAINST REUTEL THE 2ND GRENADIER GUARDS AND THE IRISH GUARDS BEING
GIVEN THE WORK OF CLEARING OUT POLYGON WOOD OF WHICH THE ENEMY
HELD THE UPPER HALF THEY WERE ADVANCING THROUGH THE WOODS AND THE
TRENCHES OF THE WORCESTER BATTALION THERE WHEN A BIG SHELL BURST
IN LIEUTENANT FERGUSONS PLATOON NO 3 COMPANY KILLING 4 AND
WOUNDING 9 MEN AS FAR AS WAS KNOWN FERGUSON HIMSELF KNOCKED DOWN
BUT UNWOUNDED WENT BACK TO ADVISE NO 2 COMPANY COMING UP BEHIND
HIM TO DEVIATE A LITTLE FOR THE GROUND WAS A SLAUGHTERHOUSE
THE BATTALION FOUGHT ITS WAY TO A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS NORTH OF
REUTEL AND WAS THEN BROUGHT UNDER HEAVY RIFLEFIRE FROM CONCEALED
TRENCHES ON A RIDGE THE 2ND GRENADIERS ON THE RIGHT HAD EARLIER
BEEN HELD UP BY A GERMAN TRENCH ON THEIR LEFT AND AS DARK CAME
ON TOUCH BETWEEN THE BATTALIONS THERE WAS LOST AND THE PATROL
SENT OUT TO REGAIN IT ONLY STUMBLED ON THE GERMAN TRENCH THE LEFT
OF THE BATTALION LOST TOUCH BY NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE WITH THE
5TH BRIGADE AND AS THE WET NIGHT CLOSED IN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES
ISOLATED IN DARKNESS AND DRIPPING AUTUMN UNDERGROWTH WITH THE OLD
ORDERS TO HOLD GROUND GAINED AT ALL COSTS MEANTIME THEY HUNG
WITH BOTH FLANKS IN THE AIR AND ENEMY PATROLS ON EITHER SIDE THE
NEAREST SUPPORTS OF ANY KIND WERE THE TRENCHES OF THE WORCESTERS
SIX HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND THROUGH THE WOODS SO THE BATTALION LINKED
UP WITH THEM BY MEANS OF A DOUBLE FRONT OF MEN BACK TO BACK STRUNG
OUT TAILWISE FROM THEIR BIVOUAC TO THE WORCESTERS THE MANUVRE
SUCCEEDED THERE WAS SNIPING ALL NIGHT FROM EVERY SIDE BUT THANKS TO
THE FAITHFUL TAIL THE ENEMY COULD NOT GET ROUND THE BATTALION TO
MAKE SURE WHETHER IT WAS WHOLLY IN THE AIR THE CASUALTIES THIS DAY
WERE REPORTED AS 4 KILLED AND 23 WOUNDED

AT 4 A M ON THE 26TH OCTOBER JUST AFTER THE NIGHTS RAIN HAD
CEASED WORD CAME FROM BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS THAT THE 3RD COLDSTREAM
WERE TO BE EXPECTED ON THE BATTALIONS RIGHT THEY ARRIVED AN HOUR
AND A HALF LATER AND THE BATTALION ATTACKED AGAIN TO BE HELD UP IN
A SALIENT HEAVILY ENFILADED FROM EVERY ANGLE BY MACHINEGUNS AND
THOUGH NO 2 COMPANY CARRIED A COUPLE OF FARMHOUSES OUTSIDE THE
WOODS THEY WERE FORCED TO RETIRE FROM ONE OF THEM AND LOST HEAVILY
AN ATTACK BY THE 6TH BRIGADE IN THE AFTERNOON RELIEVED THE PRESSURE
A LITTLE AND HELPED THE BATTALION TO GET IN TOUCH WITH AT LEAST
ITS BRIGADE LIEUTENANT SHIELDS RAMC ATTACHED WAS KILLED HERE
WHILE ATTENDING OUR WOUNDED HE HAD BEEN REMONSTRATED WITH ONLY A
FEW MINUTES BEFORE FOR EXPOSING HIMSELF TOO MUCH AND PAID AS MUCH
HEED TO THE REBUKE AS DID THE OTHERS WHO SUCCEEDED HIM IN HIS OFFICE
THE CASUALTIES FOR THE DAY WERE 1 OFFICER AND 9 MEN KILLED AND 42
WOUNDED THE NIGHT WAS MEMORABLE INASMUCH AS THE BATTALION WHICH HAD
HAD NO FOOD FOR FORTYEIGHT HOURS WAS ALLOWED TO EAT ITS EMERGENCY
RATIONS

THERE WAS A GERMAN ATTACK ON THE NIGHT OF THE 27TH OCTOBER LASTING
FOR LESS THAN AN HOUR BUT THE ADVANCE OF THE 6TH BRIGADE ON THE
BATTALIONS LEFT TOGETHER WITH THE ADVANCE OF THE FRENCH STILL
FARTHER TO THE LEFT THREATENING PASSCHENDAELE KEPT THE ENEMY
MODERATELY QUIET TILL THE BATTALION WAS RELIEVED IN THE EVENING OF
THE 27TH BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AND WENT INTO BIVOUAC JUST WEST OF
RACECOURSE WOOD IT WAS SHELLED WHILE SETTLING DOWN HERE AND AT
INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT MAJOR HERBERT STEPNEY WAS SLIGHTLY
WOUNDED IN THE BACK BY A BULLET WHEN AT SUPPER IN A FARMHOUSE 2
MEN WERE KILLED AND 3 WOUNDED CAPTAIN A H L MCCARTHY RAMC
JOINED FOR DUTY REPLACING LIEUTENANT SHIELDS

NEXT MORNING OCTOBER 28 THE 5TH BRIGADE WAS ATTACKING AND THE
BATTALION WAS ORDERED TO SUPPORT IT WAS HEAVILY SHELLED AGAIN IN
THE WOOD AND DUG ITSELF IN NORTHWEST ON THE RACECOURSE WHERE IT
STAYED ALL DAY READY TO SUPPORT THE COLDSTREAM AND HAD A QUIET
TIME THE CO LORD ARDEE WENT TO HOSPITAL WITH A BAD THROAT
LIEUTENANT GREER WAS WOUNDED WHILE SERVING HIS MACHINEGUN WHICH HAD
BEEN LENT TO THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AND A COUPLE OF MEN WERE WOUNDED
DRILLSERGEANT A WINSPEAR JOINED THE CONNAUGHT RANGERS AS 2ND
LIEUTENANTONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE ARMY OFFICERS PROMOTED FROM
THE RANKS

THE ENEMY AT THAT DATE WERE SO SURE OF SUCCESS THAT THEY MADE NO
ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL THEIR INTENTIONS AND ALL OUR SPENT FORCES ON THE
YPRES FRONT WERE WELL AWARE THAT A SERIOUS ATTACK WOULD BE OPENED
ON THEM ON THE 29TH RUMOUR SAID IT WOULD BE SUPERINTENDED BY THE
KAISER HIMSELF BUT SO FAR AS THE BATTALION WAS CONCERNED THAT DAY
WAS RELATIVELY QUIET THE 2ND BRIGADE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO RETAKE
THE TRENCHES LOST BY THE 1ST BRIGADE EAST OF GHELUVELT AND THE
BATTALIONS DUTY WITH THE 2ND GRENADIERS WAS TO FILL UP WHATEVER
GAPS MIGHT BE FOUND IN A LINE WHICH WAS MAINLY GAPS BETWEEN THE LEFT
OF THE 2ND AND THE RIGHT OF THE 1ST BRIGADE NEAR POLDERHOEK IT
REACHED THE LIGHT RAILWAY FROM GHELUVELT TO POLDERHOEK DISCOVERED
THAT THE GAP THERE COULD BE FILLED UP BY A PLATOON COMMUNICATED WITH
THE COS OF THE TWO BRIGADES CONCERNED SENT BACK THREE COMPANIES
TO THE 4TH BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS LEFT ONE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE
1ST BRIGADE AND AT NIGHT WITHDREW FOR THE MOMENT THE LINE COULD
BE HELD WITH THE TROOPS ON THE SPOT AND IT WAS NO POLICY TO USE
A MAN MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY THE CASUALTIES TO THE MEN FOR THAT
DAY WERE BUT 4 KILLED AND 6 WOUNDED THOUGH A SHELL BURST ON THE
BRIGADE RESERVE AMMUNITION COLUMN WEST OF RACECOURSE WOOD AND DID
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE

THE 30TH OCTOBER OPENED ON THE HEAVIEST CRISIS OF THE LONG BATTLE OF
YPRES THE BATTALION TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT OF JACK JOHNSONS DUG
TRENCHES A QUARTER OF A MILE WEST OF RACECOURSE WOOD IN CASE THE
TROOPS AT THE FARTHER END OF IT SHOULD BE DRIVEN BACK FOR IN THOSE
YEARS WOODS WERE VISIBLE AND GAVE GOOD COVER GERMAN AEROPLANES
WELL AWARE THAT THEY HAD NO ANTIAIRCRAFT GUNS TO FEAR SWOOPED LOW
OVER THEM IN THE MORNING AND MEN COULD ONLY REPLY WITH SOME PITIFUL
RIFLEFIRE

IN THE AFTERNOON ORDERS CAME FOR THEM AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS TO STOP
DIGGING AND MOVE UP TO KLEIN ZILLEBEKE TO SUPPORT THE HARDPRESSED
SEVENTH DIVISION ON WHOSE FRONT THE ENEMY HAD BROKEN THROUGH
AGAIN WHEN THEY REACHED WHAT WAS MORE OR LESS THE LINE NOS 1
AND 2 COMPANIES WERE SENT FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE CAVALRY IN THEIR
TRENCHES WHILE NOS 3 AND 4 COMPANIES DUG THEMSELVES IN BEHIND KLEIN
ZILLEBEKE3 A GAP OF ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE WAS FOUND RUNNING
FROM THE KLEIN ZILLEBEKEZANDVOORDE ROAD NORTH TO THE TRENCHES OF THE
2ND GORDON HIGHLANDERS AND PATROLS REPORTED THE ENEMY IN FORCE IN A
STRIP OF WOOD IMMEDIATELY TO THE EAST OF IT WHETHER THE GAP HAD BEEN
BLASTED OUT BY CONCENTRATED ENEMYFIRE OR WHETHER WHAT THE GUNS HAD
LEFT OF OUR CAVALRY HAD RETIRED WAS NEVER CLEAR THE BATTALION WAS
TOLD OFF TO HOLD THE PLACE AND TO FIND OUT WHO WAS ON EITHER SIDE OF
THEM WHILE THE 2ND GRENADIERS CONTINUED THE LINE SOUTHWARD FROM THE
MAIN ROAD TO THE CANAL BEGINNING AT 11 P M THEY DUG THEMSELVES
IN TILL MORNING LIGHT A BURNING FARMHOUSE BLAZED STEADILY ALL
NIGHT IN A HOLLOW BY ZANDVOORDE AND OUR PATROLS ON THE ROAD COULD
SEE THE GERMANS IN THEIR SPIKED HELMETS SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE
GLARE AS THEY STORMED OUT OF THE WOODS AND MASSED BEHIND THE FOLD
OF THE GROUND READY FOR THE MORNINGS ATTACK TWO YEARS LATER OUR
GUNS WOULD HAVE WAITED ON THEIR TELEPHONES TILL THE ENEMY FORMATION
WAS COMPLETED AND WOULD THEN HAVE REMOVED THOSE BATTALIONS FROM THE
FACE OF THE EARTH BUT WE HAD NOT THOSE GUNS DURING THE NIGHT THE
OXFORDSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY CAME UP AND OCCUPIED A FARM BETWEEN THE
BATTALION AND THE GORDON HIGHLANDERS AND STRENGTHENED THE SITUATION
A LITTLE COMPANY COMMANDERS HAD ALREADY BEEN OFFICIALLY WARNED THAT
THE POSITION WAS SERIOUS AND THAT THEY MUST HANG ON AT ALL COSTS
ALSO THAT THE KAISER HIMSELF WAS IN FRONT OF THEM

ON THE 31ST AFTER AN ATTACK BY THE FRENCH TOWARDS HOLLEBEKE WHICH
DID NOT DEVELOP THE FULL STORM BROKE THE BATTALION BACKED BY
TWO RFA GUNS WAS SHELLED FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING TILL ELEVEN
OCLOCK AT NIGHT IN SUCH TRENCHES AS IT HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONSTRUCT
DURING THE NIGHT WHILE MACHINEGUN AND INFANTRY FIRE GREW STEADILY
THROUGH THE HOURS THE COMPANIES WERE DISPOSED AS FOLLOWS NO 4
COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH OF THE MAIN WOOD THEN NO 3 WITH
NO 1 IN TOUCH WITH THE OXFORDSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY AT A FARMHOUSE
NEXT TO THE GORDONS NO 2 WAS IN RESERVE AT A FARM WITH HEADQUARTERS

ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 31ST OCTOBER LORD ARDEE ARRIVED FROM
HOSPITAL THOUGH HE WAS IN NO STATE TO BE OUT OF IT AND WAS GREETED
BY THE INFORMATION THAT THE GORDONS ON THE LEFT HEAVILY SHELLED HAD
BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR TRENCHES THE OXFORD LI AND ALSO NO 1
COMPANY OF THE BATTALION WHICH WAS IN TOUCH WITH THEM HAD TO CONFORM
TO THE MOVEMENT THE SECTION OF RFA HAD TO RETIRE ALSO WITH THE
GORDONS AND AFTER APOLOGIES DULY DELIVERED AMONG BURSTING GERMAN
SHELL FOR HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THEIR GUNS THEY LIMBERED UP AND
WENT OFF AS THOUGH IT WERE THE MILITARY TOURNAMENT THERE WAS A
COUNTERATTACK AND EVENTUALLY THE ENEMY WERE DRIVEN BACK AND THE
LINE WAS REESTABLISHED BEFORE NIGHT WHICH PASSED SAYS THE DIARY
FAIRLY QUIETLY THE MOONLIGHT MADE MOVEMENT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOR
COULD THE MEN GET ANY HOT TEA THEIR GREAT STANDBY BUT RATIONS WERE
DISTRIBUTED THE CASUALTIES AMONG OFFICERS THAT DAY WERE LIEUTENANT
L S COKE KILLED AND BURIED IN THE GARDEN OF THE FARM CAPTAIN LORD
FRANCIS SCOTT LIEUTENANT THE EARL OF KINGSTON AND LIEUTENANT R
FERGUSON WOUNDED THERE WERE MANY CASUALTIES IN THE FRONT TRENCHES
SPECIALLY AMONG NO 3 COMPANY MEN BEING BLOWN TO PIECES AND NO
TRACE LEFT THE DEPRESSING THING ABOVE ALL WAS THAT WE SEEMED TO
HAVE NO GUNS TO REPLY WITH

BOMBARDMENT WAS RENEWED ON THE 1ST NOVEMBER THE FRONT TRENCHES WERE
DRENCHED BY FIELDGUNS AT CLOSE RANGE WITH SPURTS OF HEAVY STUFF
AT INTERVALS THE REAR BY HEAVY ARTILLERY WHILE MACHINEGUN FIRE
FILLED THE INTERVALS ONE OF THE TRENCHES OF A PLATOON IN NO 3
COMPANY UNDER LIEUTENANT MAITLAND WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN IN AND ONLY
A FEW MEN ESCAPED THE LIEUTENANT REMAINED WITH THE SURVIVORS WHILE
SERGEANT C HARRADINE UNDER HEAVY FIRE TOOK THE NEWS TO THE CO
IT WAS HOPELESS TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS THE MACHINEGUN FIRE WOULD
HAVE WIPED THEM OUT MOVING AND OUR ARTILLERY WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO
SILENCE ANY ONE SECTOR OF THE ENEMYS FIRE

IN THE AFTERNOON THE ENEMY ATTACKEDWITH RIFLEFIRE AND A
CLOSERANGE SMALL PIECE THAT BROKE UP OUR TWO MACHINEGUNSACROSS
SOME DEAD GROUND AND OCCUPIED THE WRECKED TRENCH DRIVING BACK THE
FEW REMAINS OF NO 3 COMPANY THE COMPANIES ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT
NOS 4 AND 1 AFTER HEAVY FIGHTING FELL BACK ON NO 2 COMPANY WHICH
WAS OCCUPYING ROUGHLY PREPARED TRENCHES IN THE REAR ONE PLATOON
HOWEVER OF NO 1 COMPANY UNDER LIEUTENANT N WOODROFFE HE HAD
ONLY LEFT ETON A YEAR DID NOT GET THE ORDER TO RETIRE AND SO
HELD ON IN ITS TRENCH TILL DARK AND WAS CERTAINLY INSTRUMENTAL IN
CHECKING THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY THE LINE WAS NEAR BREAKINGPOINT
BY THEN BUT COMPANY AFTER COMPANY DELIVERED WHAT BLOW IT COULD AND
FELL BACK SHELLED AND MACHINEGUNNED AT EVERY STEP TO THE FRINGE
OF ZILLEBEKE WOOD HERE THE OFFICERS EVERY COOK ORDERLY AND MAN
WHO COULD STAND TOOK RIFLE AND FOUGHT FOR THEY WERE ALL THAT STOOD
THERE BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND THE CHANNEL PORTS YEARS LATER A MAN
REMEMBERING THAT FIGHT SAID TWAS LIKE A FOOTBALL SCRUM EVERY
ONE WAS SOMEBODY YELL UNDERSTAND IF HE DROPPED THERE WAS NO ONE
TO TAKE HIS PLACE GREAT DAYS AN WE NOT SO FRIGHTENED AS WHEN IT
CAME TO THE FIGHTIN BY MACHINERY ON THE SOMME AFTERWARDS4
THE CO SENT THE ADJUTANT TO BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS TO ASK FOR HELP
BUT THE WHOLE STAFF HAD GONE OVER TO THE 2ND BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS
WHOSE BRIGADIER HAD TAKEN OVER COMMAND OF THE 4TH BRIGADE AS ITS OWN
BRIGADIER HAD BEEN WOUNDED ABOUT THIS TIME TOO THE CO OF THE
BATTALION LORD ARDEE WAS WOUNDED EVENTUALLY THE 2ND BATTALION
GRENADIERS WAS SENT UP WITH SOME CAVALRY OF THE MUCHENDURING 7TH
BRIGADE AND THE LINE OF SUPPORTTRENCHES WAS HELD THE BATTALION HAD
HAD NOTHING TO EAT FOR THIRTYSIX HOURS SO THE CAVALRY KEPT THE LINE

AND LIEUTENANT G M MAITLAND WHO HAD STAYED WITH HIS HANDFUL IN NO
3 COMPANYS TRENCH WAS MISSING YET THE TIME WAS TO COME WHEN THREE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASUALTIES WOULD BE REGARDED AS NO EXTRAORDINARY
PRICE TO PAY FOR GROUND WON OR HELD ONE SMALL DRAFT OF 40 MEN
ARRIVED FROM HOME THAT NIGHT

ON NOVEMBER 2 THE BATTALION WAS REDUCED TO THREE COMPANIES SINCE IN
NO 3 COMPANY ALL OFFICERS WERE CASUALTIES AND ONLY 26 MEN OF IT
ANSWERED THEIR NAMES AT ROLLCALL THEY WERE HEAVILY SHELLED ALL THAT
DAY THEY TRIED TO PUT UP A LITTLE WIRE ON THEIR FRONT DURING THE
NIGHT THEY COLLECTED WHAT DEAD THEY COULD THEY RECEIVED SEVERAL
WOUNDED MEN OF THE DAYS FIGHT AS THEY CRAWLED INTO OUR LINES THEY
HEARD ONE SUCH MAN CALLING IN THE DARK AND THEY HEARD THE ENEMY TURN
A MACHINEGUN ON HIM AND SILENCE HIM THE REGULAR WORK OF SENDING
FORWARD AND RELIEVING THE COMPANIES IN THE FRONT LINE WENT ON VARIED
BY AN ATTACK FROM THE ENEMY CHIEFLY RIFLEFIRE ON THE NIGHT OF
THE 3RD NOVEMBER ON THAT DATE THEY RECEIVED A NEW MACHINEGUN
AND ANOTHER DRAFT OF SIXTY MEN UNDER CAPTAIN E C S KINGHARMAN
SEVERAL OF WHOM WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED THAT SAME AFTERNOON THE
NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH FALSE ALARMS AS SOME OF THE NEW DRAFTS BEGAN
TO IMAGINE CROWDS OF GERMANS ADVANCING OUT OF THE DARK THIS WAS A
POPULAR OBSESSION BUT IT LED TO WASTE OF AMMUNITION AND WAKING UP
UTTERLY TIRED MEN ELSEWHERE IN THE LINE

ON THE 4TH NOVEMBER THERE WAS AN OUTBURST OF MACHINEGUNNING FROM A
FARMHOUSE NOT 300 YARDS AWAY ONE FIELDGUN WAS BROUGHT UP TO DEAL
WITH THEM AND SOME OF THE 2ND LIFE GUARDS STOOD BY TO HELP IN EVENT
OF AN ATTACK BUT THE ENEMY CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH MERE PUNISHING
FIRE

ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 5 THEY LOCATED OUR ONE FIELDGUN WHICH WAS
STILL TRYING TO COPE WITH THE ENEMYS MACHINEGUNS SHELLED IT FOR AN
HOUR VIGOROUSLY BLEW UP THE FARMHOUSE THAT SHELTERED IT BUTCLEAN
MISSED THE GUN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN FIRING AT LEAST ONE ROUND EVERY
TEN MINUTES ONE OF OUR WOUNDED OF THE 1ST NOVEMBER MANAGED TO CRAWL
INTO OUR LINES HE HAD BEEN THREE DAYS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATERTHE
GERMANS WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD DIE REFUSING HIM BOTH THERE WAS HEAVY
SHELLING AND ABOUT THIRTY CASUALTIES IN THE LINE AS FAR AS KNOWN

ON THE 6TH AFTER AN HOURS PREPARATION WITH HEAVY LIGHT AND
MACHINEGUN FIRE THE ENEMY ATTACKED THE FRENCH TROOPS ON THE
BATTALIONS RIGHT WHO FELL BACK AND LEFT THE FLANK OF THE BATTALION
NO 2 COMPANY OPEN THE COMPANY IN GOOD ORDER AND FIGHTING
FELL BACK BY PLATOONS TO ITS SUPPORT TRENCHES BUT THIS LEFT NO
1 COMPANY PRACTICALLY IN THE AIR AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THE
GREATER PART OF THEM WERE MISSING AS THE GERMANS OCCUPIED THE
FRENCH TRENCHES IN SUCCESSION THEY OPENED AN ENFILADE FIRE ON THE
IRISH WHICH DID SORE EXECUTION ONCE AGAIN THE ADJUTANT WENT TO THE
BRIGADIER TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION THE HOUSEHOLD CAVALRY WERE SENT
UP AT THE GALLOP TO ZILLEBEKE WHERE THEY DISMOUNTED AND ADVANCED
ON FOOT THE 1ST LIFE GUARDS ON THE LEFT WERE DETAILED TO RETAKE
THE IRISH GUARDS TRENCHES WHILE THE 2ND LIFE GUARDS ATTACKED
THE POSITION WHENCE THE FRENCH HAD BEEN OUSTED A HUNDRED IRISH
GUARDSMEN COLLECTED ON THE SPOT ALSO TOOK PART IN THE ATTACK WHICH
IN AN HOUR RECOVERED MOST OF THE LOST POSITIONS HERE LIEUTENANT W
E HOPE WAS KILLED AND A LITTLE LATER LIEUTENANT N WOODROFFE FELL
SHOT DEAD IN THE ADVANCE OF THE HOUSEHOLD CAVALRY TWO COMPANIES
HAD THESE BEEN AVAILABLE COULD HAVE HELD THE SUPPORTTRENCHES
AFTER THE HOUSEHOLD CAVALRY HAD CLEARED THE FRONT BUT THERE WERE
NO REINFORCEMENTS AND THE UNCEASING PRESSURE ON THE FRENCH DROVE
THE BATTALION BACK ON A FRESH LINE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
THE SUPPORT TRENCHES WHICH THE CAVALRY HELD TILL THE REMAINS OF THE
BATTALION HAD REFORMED AND GOT SOME HOT TEA FROM THE EVERFORWARD
COOKERS IN ADDITION TO LIEUTENANTS HOPE AND WOODROFFE KILLED
CAPTAIN LORD JOHN HAMILTON AND LIEUTENANT E C S KINGHARMAN WHO

DAY

ON NOVEMBER 7 THE BATTALION RELIEVED THE CAVALRY AT ONE IN THE
MORNING AND DUG AND DEEPENED THEIR TRENCHES ON THE EDGE OF THE
WOOD TILL WORD CAME TO THEM TO KEEP UP A HEAVY FIRE ON ANY ENEMY

RIGHT THAT BRIGADE NOW REDUCED TO TWO COMPOSITE BATTALIONSTHE
ROYAL WELSH FUSILIERS WITH THE 2ND QUEENS AND THE WARWICKS WITH
S STAFFORDSBOTH COMMANDED BY CAPTAINS DID ALL THAT WAS HUMANLY
POSSIBLE AGAINST THE PRESSURE BUT IN THE END AS THE DIARY SAYS
HAVING FAILED TO GET THE LINE REQUIRED WITHDREW UNDER HEAVY
SHELLFIRE THEIR ATTACK WAS NO MORE THAN ONE OF MANY DESPERATE
INTERLUDES IN THE DESPERATE FIRST BATTLE OF YPRESA WINNING FIGHT
AGAINST HOPELESS ODDS OF MEN AND MATERIALBUT IT DIVERTED ATTENTION
FOR THE MOMENT FROM THE BATTALIONS PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE LINE
AND THE ENEMY DID NOT SHELL OUR TRENCHES MUCH EARLY IN THE DAY
MAJOR STEPNEY COMMANDING WENT OUT FROM THE SUPPORT TRENCHES AND
WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN ALIVE HIS BODY WAS FOUND LATE IN THE EVENING

SOME DIFFICULTY AS SNIPERS WERE BUSY AS THEY HAD BEEN ALL DAY ONE
OFFICER WROTE OUR MEN ARE VERY TIRED AND THE RIFLES ARE IN AN AWFUL
STATE IT RAINS CONTINUOUSLY AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ANY SORT OF
RIFLEOIL

THE 16TH NOVEMBER A DAY OF SNOW AND HEAVY FIRING ENDING IN AN
ATTACK WHICH WAS SUPPRESSED BY RAPID FIRE WAS GRIMLY ENLIVENED BY
THE APPEARANCE OF ONE GERMAN DESERTER WITH TWO FINGERS SHOT OFF WHO
ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF FIGHTING

ON THE 17TH NOVEMBER BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS WERE BLOWN IN BY
SHELLFIRE BOTH OF THE IRISH GUARDS ORDERLIES ON DUTY WERE INJURED

NOT PRESSED HOME FOLLOWED AT THREE OCLOCK ANOTHER OUTBREAK OF
SMALLARM FIRE AT HALFPAST NINE AND YET ANOTHER TOWARDS MIDNIGHT
AND A HEAVY SHELLING OF THE FRENCH ON OUR RIGHT THEN ALL WAS
QUIET SAYS THE EASILY SATISFIED RECORD

AMOUNT OF HEAVY SHELLING BUT NOT SO MUCH AS USUAL AND ON THE 18TH
THEIR BATTERED REMNANTS CAME OUT THEY WERE RELIEVED BY A COMPANY OF
THE 3RD COLDSTREAM CAPTAIN H DAWSON AND MARCHED OFF TO BILLETS
AT POTIJZE ON THE YPRESZONNEBEKE ROAD WHERE THE MEN GOT PLENTY OF

THEY HAD BORNE THEIR BURDEN NEEDED RENEWAL OR REPAIR THEY RESTED

THE STRENGTH OF THE BATTALION STOOD AT 700 MEN AND 15 OFFICERS OF
THE LATTER THE DIARY NOTES THAT NINE ARE IN THE SPECIAL RESERVE
SEVEN OF THEM HAVING DONE NO SORT OF SOLDIERING BEFORE THE WAR
MERCIFULLY MEN LIVED BUT ONE DAY AT A TIME OR THE DIARIST
MIGHT HAVE DRAWN CONCLUSIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE FALLEN FAR SHORT
OF WHAT THE FUTURE WAS TO BRING FROM THE FACT THAT AS MANY AS
TWELVE MACHINEGUNNERS WERE KEPT AT THE BASE BY THE ORDER OF THE
AUTHORITIES THERE WAS NEED TO TRAIN MACHINEGUNNERS AND EVEN
GREATER NEED FOR THE GUNS THEMSELVES BUT THE BATTALION WAS NOT
OCCUPIED WITH THE LARGER QUESTIONS OF THE WAR THEY HAD BORNE THEIR
PART AGAINST ALL ODDS OF NUMBERS AND EQUIPMENT IN BARRING THE GERMAN
ROAD TO THE SEA IN THE FIRST MONTHLONG BATTLE OF YPRES THEY KNEW
VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE NOT ONE OF THEIR NUMBER COULD HAVE
GIVEN ANY CONSECUTIVE ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED NOR IN THAT
GENERALPOST OF DAILY AND NIGHTLY CONFUSION WHITHER THEY HAD GONE
ALL THEY WERE SURE OF WAS THAT SUCH AS LIVED WERE NOT DEAD THE LORD
ONLY KNOWS WHY AND THAT THE ENEMY HAD NOT BROKEN THROUGH THEY HAD
NO KNOWLEDGE WHAT LABOURS STILL LAY BEFORE THEM

ON THE 3RD DECEMBER AFTER AN ISSUE OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND A VISIT
FROM SIR DOUGLAS HAIG COMMANDING THE FIRST ARMY CORPS THEY LINED
THE ROAD FROM METEREN TOWARDS BAILLEUL FOR THE VISIT OF THE KING WHO
WALKED DOWN THE LINES OF THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE AND AFTER SHAKING
HANDS WITH THE FOUR COMMANDING OFFICERS OF THE BRIGADE SAID I AM
VERY PROUD OF MY GUARDS AND AM FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THEIR BRAVERY
ENDURANCE AND FINE SPIRIT I WISH I COULD HAVE ADDRESSED THEM ALL
BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE SO YOU MUST TELL THEM WHAT I SAY TO YOU YOU
ARE FIGHTING A BRAVE AND DETERMINED ENEMY BUT IF YOU GO ON AS YOU
HAVE BEEN DOING AND SHOW THE SAME FINE SPIRIT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
END PLEASE GOD AND THAT IS VICTORY I WISH YOU ALL GOOD LUCK

VALOURS REWARD

THE DIARY NOTES THE ISSUE OF CARDIGAN WAISTCOATS AND GOATSKIN COATS
FOR EACH MAN AS WELL AS OF A NEW AMERICAN PATTERN BOOT WITH A HARD

OLD AMMUNITIONBOOT ROUTEMARCHES INCREASED IN LENGTH AND THE
MEN MARCHED AS WELL AS THEY ATE INDEED THEY VOLUNTEERED TO THE
BRIGADIER WHO CAME ROUND ONCE TO SEE THE DINNERS THAT THEY HAD
NEVER BEEN SO WELL FED IT KEPT THEM HEALTHY THOUGH THERE WERE THE
USUAL CRITICISMS FROM OFFICERS NCOS AND SURVIVING VETERANS OF
THE REGULAR ARMY ON THE QUALITY OF THE NEW DRAFTS SOME OF WHOM IT
SEEMS SUFFERED FROM BAD TEETH AND HAD TO BE SENT AWAY FOR RENEWALS
AND REFITS AS A MUCHTRIED SERGEANT REMARKED A MAN WITH A SORE
TOOTH IS A NUISANCE AN A DANGER TO THE WHOLE BRITISH ARMY

ON THE 9TH DECEMBER SIR DOUGLAS HAIG CAME OVER TO PRESENT THE

COMRADES

A PARTY FROM THE BRIGADE WAS SENT TO HEADQUARTERS OF THE 11TH
ENGINEERING COMPANY TO BE TAUGHT HOW TO THROW BOMBS MADE OUT OF
JAMPOTS WHICH APPARENTLY ARE USED AGAINST THE ENEMY AT CLOSE
QUARTERS IN THE PRESENT TRENCHWARFARE THERE WERE AT LEAST
HALFADOZEN MORE OR LESS DANGEROUS VARIETIES OF THESE HANDMADE
BOMBS IN USE BEFORE STANDARD PATTERNS WERE EVOLVED AND BOMBING TOOK
ITS PLACE AS A REGULAR AID TO WARFARE THE JAMPOT BOMB DIED EARLY
BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD CAUSED A SUFFICIENCY OF TROUBLE TO ITS USERS
THE OTHERS WILL BE MENTIONED IN DUE COURSE

AEROPLANE DUTY WAS ANOTHER INVENTION OF THOSE EARLY DAYS A COMPANY
WAS TOLD OFF DAILY TO LOOK OUT FOR AEROPLANES AND IF POSSIBLE TO
BRING THEM DOWNPRESUMABLY BY RIFLEFIRE THE WAR WAS STILL VERY
YOUNG

MAJOR ARBUTHNOT SCOTS GUARDS ARRIVED ON THE 14TH DECEMBER WITH
QUEEN ALEXANDRAS PRESENTS TO THE BATTALION WHICH WERE DULY ISSUED TO
SELECTED OFFICERS NCOS AND MEN BUT AT THE TIME THE BATTALION
WAS UNDER TWO HOURS NOTICE TO MOVE EITHER TO SUPPORT AN ATTACK THEN
BEING DELIVERED BY THE THIRD DIVISION UPON THE WOOD AT WYTSCHAETE
OR FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THE ATTACK WAS NOT A SUCCESS EXCEPT IN
SO FAR AS IT PINNED THE ENEMY FORCES TO ONE PLACE BUT THE BATTALION
WAS NOT CALLED UPON TO HELP IT LIVED UNDER SHORT NOTICE FOR A WEEK
WHICH NATURALLY INTERFERED WITH EXTENDED ROUTEMARCHES OR TRAINING
COMPANIES WERE SENT OUT ONE BY ONE TO DIG IN THE WATERLOGGED SOIL
AND TO EXTEMPORISE MEANS OF KEEPING THEIR FEET OUT OF THE WATER BY
BLOCKS OF WOOD MADE IN THE FORM OF A PLATFORM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
TRENCHES THUS LABORIOUSLY IS DESCRIBED THE GENESIS OF WHAT WAS
LATER TO GROW INTO THOUSANDS OF MILES OF DUCKBOARD PLAIN OR WIRED

MEANTIME BETWEEN THE 20TH AND 22ND OF DECEMBER THE FIERCE AND
UNSATISFACTORY BATTLE OF CUINCHY THE BURDEN OF WHICH FELL HEAVILY
ON OUR DEVOTED INDIAN TROOPS HAD BEEN FOUGHT OUT ON A FRONT OF
HALFADOZEN MILES FROM SOUTH OF THE BTHUNE CANAL TO FESTUBERT
NOTHING HAD BEEN GAINED EXCEPT THE ALLIMPORTANT ISSUETHAT THE
ENEMY DID NOT BREAK THROUGH THERE WAS A LONG CASUALTYLIST AS
CASUALTIES WERE THEN COUNTED AND THE INDIAN BRIGADES WERE WITHDRAWN
FROM THEIR WRECKED AND SODDEN TRENCHES FOR A LITTLE REST THE GUARDS
BRIGADE WAS ORDERED TO RELIEVE THEM AND ON THE 22ND MARCHED OUT
FROM METEREN THE HERTS TERRITORIAL BATTALION TO BE HONOURABLY AND
AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN LATER AS THE HERTS GUARDS LED THAT FIRST
MARCH FOLLOWED BY THE 2ND COLDSTREAM 1ST BATTALION IRISH GUARDS
THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS THEY BILLETED AT BTHUNE
WHERE ON THE 23RD DECEMBER THE 2ND COLDSTREAM IN SUPPORT THEY
TOOK OVER THEIR SHARE OF THE INDIAN TRENCHES NEAR LE TOURET BETWEEN
ESSARS AND RICHEBOURG LAVOU AND ON CHRISTMAS EVE AFTER TEA AND THE
DISTRIBUTION OF THE CHRISTMAS PUDDINGS FROM ENGLAND THE BATTALION
WITH THE HERTFORDSHIRES RELIEVED THE 4TH DOGRAS 6TH JATS AND 9TH
GURKHAS IT IS RECORDED THAT THE GURKHA BEING A SOMEWHAT SHORTER MAN
THAN THE AVERAGE GUARDSMAN THE LONG IRISH HAD TO DIG THEIR TRENCHES
ABOUT TWO FEET DEEPER AND THEY WONDERED LOUDLY WHAT SORT OF PERSONS
THESE LITTLE DARK FELLAS COULD BE

THE CHRISTMAS TRUCE OF 1914 REACHED THE BATTALION IN SEVERELY
MODIFIED FORM THEY LAY AMONG A NETWORK OF TRENCHES ALREADY MANY
TIMES FOUGHT OVER WITH COMMUNICATIONS THAT LED DIRECTLY INTO THE
ENEMYS LINES A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS AWAY SO THEY SPENT CHRISTMAS
DAY UNDER OCCASIONAL BOMBARDMENT OF HEAVY ARTILLERY IN EXPLORING
AND ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT AMONG THESE WET AND
DREARY WORKS IN THIS DUTY LIEUTENANT G P GOUGH AND LIEUTENANT F
H WITTS AND SIX MEN WERE WOUNDED

EARL KITCHENER THEIR COLONEL SENT THEM CHRISTMAS WISHES AND THE
KINGS AND QUEENS CHRISTMAS CARDS WERE DISTRIBUTED THEIR COMFORT
WAS THAT CHRISTMAS NIGHT WAS FROSTY SO THAT THE MEN KEPT DRY AT LEAST

BOXING DAY WAS QUIET TOO AND ONLY FOUR MEN WERE WOUNDED AS THEY
DUG IN THE HARD GROUND TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE
2ND COLDSTREAM ON THEIR LEFT THEN THE FROST BROKE IN RAIN THE
CLAY STUCK TO THE SPADE THE TRENCHES BEGAN TO FILL AND A DESERTER
BROUGHT NEWS OF AN IMPENDING ATTACK WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING
MORE SERIOUS THAN A BOMBING AFFAIR WHICH WAS DULY ATTENDED TO SOME
OF OUR OWN SHELLS BURSTING SHORT KILLED ONE MAN AND WOUNDED SIX
PRINCESS MARYS GIFTS OF PIPES TOBACCO AND CHRISTMAS CARDS WERE
DISTRIBUTED TO THE MEN AND DULY APPRECIATED

THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF KEEPING ANYTHING FREE FROM MUD FORCED THEM TO
REDUCE THEIR FIRINGLINE TO THE LEAST POSSIBLE NUMBERS WHILE THOSE
IN SUPPORT OR BILLETS MADE SHIFT TO CLEAN RIFLES AND ACCOUTREMENTS
THE DAYS WENT FORWARD IN RAIN AND WET WITH DIGGING WHERE WATER
ALLOWED AND A REGULAR DAILY TOLL OF A FEW MEN KILLED AND WOUNDED

ON THE 30TH DECEMBER CAPTAIN ERIC GOUGH WAS KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET
WHILE COMMANDING HIS COMPANY NO 1 AND WAS BURIED NEXT DAY IN A
CEMETERY A FEW MILES ALONG THE BTHUNERICHEBOURG ROAD HE HAD BEEN
TRANSPORT OFFICER SINCE THE BATTALION LEFT LONDON IN AUGUST BUT
HAD COMMANDED A COMPANY SINCE THE 21ST NOVEMBER AND WAS AN IMMENSE
LOSS TO THE BATTALION TO WHICH HE WAS DEVOTED LIEUTENANT SIR G
BURKE AND 2ND LIEUTENANT J M STEWART CAME FROM ENGLAND ON THE SAME
DAY AND WERE POSTED TO NO 1 COMPANY NOW COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT L
HARGREAVES

THE DIARY ENDS THE YEAR WITH A RECAPITULATION MORE IMPRESSIVE IN ITS
RESTRAINT THAN ANY MULTITUDE OF WORDS

THE COUNTRY ROUND THIS PART IS VERY LOWLYING INTERSECTED WITH
DITCHES WITH POLLARDED WILLOWS GROWING ON THEIR BANKS NO SOONER
IS A TRENCH DUG THAN IT FILLS WITH WATER THE SOIL IS CLAY AND
SO KEEPS THE WATER FROM DRAINING AWAY EVEN IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE MEN AT ALL DRY THEY HAVE TO STAND ON PLANKS
RESTED ON LOGS IN THE TRENCHES AND IN THE LESS WET PLACES BUNDLES
OF STRAW AND SHORT FASCINES ARE PUT DOWN PUMPING HAS BEEN TRIED
BUT NOT WITH MUCH SUCCESS THE WEATHER CONTINUES WET AND THERE
DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY LIKELIHOOD OF A CHANGE CONSEQUENTLY WE
MAY EXPECT SOME FRESH DISCOMFORTS DAILY




1915

LA BASSE TO LAVENTIE


THEY WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED NEW YEARS DAY WAS MARKED BY THE FLOODING
OUT OF A SECTION OF FORWARD TRENCHES AND BY EXPERIMENTS WITH A
TRENCHMORTAR FROM WHICH 2ND LIEUTENANT KEATING AND SOME GARRISON
GUNNERS THREW THREE BOMBS AT AN ENEMY DIGGINGPARTY A COUPLE OF
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY THIS IS THE FIRST REFERENCE TO OUR USE OF
TRENCHMORTARS IN THE YOUNG CAMPAIGN THE ENEMY RETALIATED NEXT DAY
BY BOMBING FROM THEIR REAL TRENCHMORTARS AT A DISTANCE OF SEVEN
HUNDRED YARDS THE SMALL FARMHOUSE WHERE BATTALION HEADQUARTERS
LAY THE BOMBS COULD BE SEEN COMING AT A VERY STEEP ANGLE BUT THE
HOUSE WAS ONLY ONCE HIT DAYLIGHT SHOWED THE WORK OF THE IRISH
TRENCHMORTAR TO HAVE BEEN SO GOODIT HAD BLOWN A GAP IN THE GERMAN
TRENCHTHAT THEY CONTINUED IT AND INFLICTED AND OBSERVED MUCH DAMAGE

THEY WERE RELIEVED ON THE 3RD JANUARY BY THE KINGS ROYAL RIFLES
AND GOT TO BILLETS NEAR VIEILLE CHAPELLE LATE THAT NIGHT A LONDON
GAZETTE ANNOUNCED THAT THE DISTINGUISHED CONDUCT MEDAL HAD BEEN
AWARDED NO 2535 SERGEANT C HARRADINE NO 1664 CORPORAL C MORAN
NO 4015 PRIVATE W MOORE SINCE KILLED IN ACTION NO 2853
LANCECORPORAL W DELANEY ALSO THE NEW DECORATION CALLED THE
MILITARY CROSS HAD BEEN AWARDED TO LIEUTENANT THE HON H W GOUGH

THE BATTALION AS A WHOLE HAD ITS REWARD FOR THE PAST TEN DAYS
WHEN THE BRIGADIER EXPRESSED HIS APPROVAL OF THE WORK OF THE GUARDS
BRIGADE AND ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE IRISH GUARDS

CLEANING AND REFIT CLASSES IN BOMBTHROWING BOTH BY HAND AND FROM
RIFLES UNDER THE ENGINEERS AND AN ELEMENTARY MACHINEGUN CLASS
UNDER 2ND LIEUTENANT STRAKER FILLED IN THE WEEK BUT THE MOST
APPRECIATED BOON AT VIEILLE CHAPELLE WAS SOME HUGE TUBS IN WHICH THE
MEN COULD BE BOILED CLEAN FATHER GWYNNE HELD SERVICE IN THE ROOFLESS
SHELLWRECKED CHURCH LONG SINCE WIPED OUT

THEY TOOK OVER TRENCHES FROM THE WORCESTERS ON THE 8TH WITH A COLD
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT AWAITED THEM FOR THE DIARY NOTES THE DAY BEFORE
ANOTHER WET DAY WHICH WILL PROBABLY COMPLETELY FILL TRENCHES ON
THE LEFT OF THE NEW LINE WITH WATER BUT IT DID NOT FILL THEM MORE
THAN TWO FEET DEEP THOUGH THE WHOLE LINE WAS AFLOAT AND IN THE
COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES SEVEN MEN GOT STUCK IN THE MUD ONE OF THEM
WAS NOT EXTRICATED FOR SIX HOURS THE RELIEF TOOK SIX AND A HALF
HOURS IN POURING RAIN WITH ONE MAN KILLED AND TWO WOUNDED THE
FRONT LINE OF THE GUARDS BRIGADE WAS HELD BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM ON
THE RIGHT THE 2ND COLDSTREAM IN SUPPORT ONE COMPANY OF THE 2ND
GRENADIERS IN THE CENTRE AND THE REST OF THE BATTALION IN SUPPORT
THE IRISH GUARDS ON THE LEFT THE HERTS TERRITORIALS IN SUPPORT THE
GRENADIERS RELIEVED THEIR FRONT COMPANY EVERY TWENTYFOUR HOURS
THE OTHERS EVERY FORTYEIGHT THIS MEANT THAT BATTALION COS HAD
TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THE FRONT LINE STUDYING WHAT WAS IN
EFFECT THE NAVIGATION OF CANALS

ON THE 9TH JANUARY FOR EXAMPLE THE WATER AVERAGED THREE FEET IN
THE TRENCHES AND AS THAT AVERAGE ROSE IT WAS DECIDED TO LEAVE
A FEW STRONG POSTS IN COMPARATIVELY DRY POSITIONS AND WITHDRAW
THE OTHERS ALONG THE RUE DU BOIS INTO THE DESTROYED VILLAGE OF
RICHEBOURG LAVOU LUCKILY THE ENEMY NOT TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
HAD HIS OWN TROUBLES TO ATTEND TO AND DESPITE HIS LAVISH FLARES AND
MUSKETRYFIRE OUR MEN WERE EXTRICATED BODILY IN SOME INSTANCES
WITH BUT 3 KILLED AND 2 WOUNDED

ON THE 10TH JANUARY THE HERTS REGIMENT RELIEVED THEM AND THE WHOLE
BATTALION BILLETED AT RICHEBOURG ST VAAST CASUALTIES FROM SMALLARM
FIRE HAD BEEN INCREASING OWING TO THE SODDEN STATE OF THE PARAPETS
BUT THE BATTALION RETALIATED A LITTLE FROM ONE TELESCOPICSIGHTED
RIFLE SENT UP BY LIEUTENANT THE EARL OF KINGSTON WITH WHICH
DRILLSERGEANT BRACKEN CERTAINLY ACCOUNTED FOR 3 KILLED AND 4
WOUNDED OF THE ENEMY THE DIARY MERCIFULLY BLIND TO THE DREADFUL
YEARS TO COME THINKS THERE SHOULD BE MANY OF THESE RIFLES USED AS
LONG AS THE ARMY IS SITTING IN TRENCHES MANY OF THEM WERE SO USED
THIS THE FATHER OF THEM ALL NOW HANGS IN THE REGIMENTAL MESS

THEN TRENCHFEET AND RHEUMATISM DEVELOPED AND IN FORTYEIGHT HOURS
FIFTY MEN HAD TO BE SENT TO HOSPITAL FOR ONE FORM OR OTHER OF THESE
COMPLAINTS

A DRAFT OF A HUNDRED FRESH MEN ARRIVED BETWEEN THE 11TH AND 12TH OF
JANUARY WITH SIX OFFICERS CAPTAIN P S LONGINNES 2ND LIEUTENANTS
F F GRAHAM J R RALLI R B H KEMP D W GUNSTON DEREK AND
J T ROBYNS ECONOMY IN OFFICERS AND MEN WAS NOT YET POSSIBLE FOR
WHEN AN OFFICER WAS NOT IN THE FRONT LINE HE HAD MORE THAN ALL HE
COULD DO TO LOOK AFTER WHAT COMFORTS WERE OBTAINABLE FOR THE MEN
YET CONCESSIONS WERE MADE TO HUMAN WEAKNESS FOR WHEN THE BATTALION
RETURNED TO ITS TRENCHES ON THE 12TH AN ORDER WAS RECEIVED AND TO
SOME EXTENT OBEYED THAT MEN WERE NOT TO STAND IN THE WATER FOR
MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS AT A TIME THIS CALLED FOR CONTINUOUS
RELIEFS OF THE PLATOONS AS IT TOOK A MAN MOST OF HIS REST IN
BILLETS TO SCRAPE HIMSELF MODERATELY CLEAN TO SAVE THE LABOUR OF
PORTAGE THROUGH THE MUD EACH MAN WAS GIVEN TWO DAYS SUPPLIES
WHEN HE WENT INTO THE TRENCHES PLUS SOME DRY TEA AND A COUPLE OF
TINS OF MACONOCHIE TO HEAT UP OVER THE BRAZIERS THE IDEA WORKED
SATISFACTORILY FOR THE DAYS OF THE MERCILESS AIRPATROLS HAD YET
TO COME AND THE BRAZIERS FLARED NAKED TO HEAVEN WHILE THE IRISH
DRUMMED UP WHICH IS TO SAY STEWED THEIR TEA OR RATIONS ON THEM

THE HOPELESS WORK OF IMPROVING POSITIONS IN SOIL NO STIFFER THAN
PORRIDGE WAS RESUMED AND THE TELESCOPICSIGHTED RIFLE IN THE
HANDS OF SERGEANTMAJOR KIRK AND DRILLSERGEANT BRACKEN WHO WERE
LATER CONGRATULATED BY THE GOC SECOND DIVISION CONTINUED ITS
DISCREET AND GUARDED LABOURS AMONG THE ENEMY ONLY 1 MAN WAS KILLED
AND 1 WOUNDED ON THE 13TH JANUARY AND THE NIGHT OF THAT EASY DAY
PASSED OFF QUIETLY THE ENEMY OCCUPYING HIMSELF CHIEFLY WITH SINGING
SONGS OR PLAYING ON MOUTHORGANS HERE AND ELSEWHERE HE WAS GIVEN
TO SPASMS OF MUSIC FOR NO ASCERTAINABLE REASON WHICH THE IRISH WHO
DO NOT NATURALLY BURST INTO SONG RATHER RESENTED BETWEEN MORCEAUX
HE SENT UP MANY COLOURED FLARES WHILE OUR WORKINGPARTIES SILENTLY
COMPLETED AND CHRISTENED BY THE NAME OF GIBRALTAR A POST TO COMMAND
A FLOODED GAP IN THE OOZY LINE

THEY WERE RELIEVED ON THE 15TH JANUARY BY THE HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY
OF THE 3RD BRIGADE LAHORE DIVISION WHICH WAS TAKING OVER THE LINE
HELD BY THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE THE BATTALION WENT BACK TO BRIGADE
RESERVE BILLETS AT LOCON5

THEIR LAST WEEK IN THE TRENCHES HAD COST THEM 82 CASUALTIES INCLUDING
SICK BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT AT THIS TIME CAPTAIN MCCARTHY
THE MEDICAL OFFICER BY ISSUING MUSTARD MIXED WITH LARD FOR THE
MEN TO RUB ON THEIR FEET HAD IN THREE DAYS GOT THE BETTER OF THE
EPIDEMIC OF TRENCH OR AS THEY WERE THEN CALLED SWOLLEN FEET

IT WAS WHILE IN RESERVE THAT 2ND LIEUT KEATING BOMBING INSTRUCTOR
AND IN CHARGE OF THE TRENCHMORTARS LOST HIS LIFE AND 13 MEN WERE
WOUNDED OWING TO THE PREMATURE EXPLOSION OF AN OLDTYPE FUSED BOMB
WITH WHICH HE WAS INSTRUCTING A CLASS SECOND LIEUTENANT KEATING WAS
BURIED NEXT DAY IN THE CEMETERY NEAR LE TOURET WHERE MANY GUARDSMEN
WERE ALREADY LAID AND HIS EPITAPH MAY WORTHILY STAND AS IT WAS
WRITTENA VERY CAPABLE OFFICER ALWAYS READY TO UNDERTAKE ANY TASK
HOWEVER DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS

AFTER A FEW DAYS THE BATTALION WENT INTO CORPS RESERVE AND SPENT A
WEEK IN BEING SMARTENED UP BEHIND THE LINE WITH STEADY DRILL
RIFLE EXERCISES ROUTEMARCHING AND KIT INSPECTION ON RAINY DAYS
LEST LIFE IN THE CAKED FILTH OF THE TRENCHES SHOULD LEAD ANY ONE
TO FORGET THE STANDARD OF THE BRIGADE OF GUARDS WHICH UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCE ALLOWS ANY EXCUSE

THEIR WORK WAS INTERRUPTED BY ANOTHER KAISERBATTLE OBEDIENTLY
PLANNED TO CELEBRATE THE ALL HIGHESTS BIRTHDAY IT BEGAN ON THE
25TH JANUARY WITH A DEMONSTRATION ALONG THE WHOLE FLAT FRONT FROM
FESTUBERT TO VERMELLES BTHUNE WAS ALSO SHELLED FROM AN ARMOURED
TRAIN RUN OUT OF LA BASSE AND A HEAVY ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED BY
PRUSSIAN INFANTRY ON A SALIENT OF OUR LINE HELD BY THE 1ST INFANTRY
BRIGADE WHERE IT JOINED THE FRENCH LINE AMONG THE TANGLE OF RAILWAY
TRACKS AND BRICKFIELDS NEAR CUINCHY OWING TO THE MUD THE SALIENT
WAS LIGHTLY MANNED BY HALF A BATTALION OF THE SCOTS GUARDS AND HALF
A BATTALION OF THE COLDSTREAM THEIR TRENCHES WERE WIPED OUT BY THE
ARTILLERY ATTACK AND THEIR LINE FELL BACK PERHAPS HALF A MILE TO
A PARTIALLY PREPARED POSITION AMONG THE BRICKFIELDS AND RAILWAY
LINES BETWEEN THE AIRELA BASSE CANAL AND THE LA BASSEBTHUNE
ROAD HERE FIGHTING CONTINUED WITH REINFORCEMENTS AND COUNTERATTACKS
KNEEDEEP IN MUD TILL THE ENEMY WERE CHECKED AND A NONE TOO STABLE
DEFENCE MADE GOOD BETWEEN A MESS OF GERMAN COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES AND
A KEEP OR REDOUBT HELD BY THE BRITISH AMONG THE HUGE BRICKSTACKS
BY THE RAILWAY SO FAR AS THE BATTALION WAS CONCERNED THIS PHASE
OF THE AFFAIR SEEMS TO HAVE LED TO NO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYS
STANDINGTO IN READINESS TO SUPPORT WITH THE REST OF THE BRIGADE AND
TAKING WHAT ODD SHELLS FELL TO THEIR SHARE

NO INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE SELFCENTRED THAN A BATTALION IN THE FACE
OF WAR STEADY DRILL AND COMPANY KIT INSPECTIONS WERE CARRIED ON
IN THE LULLS OF THE WAITING AND THEIR MAIN PREOCCUPATION WAS HOW
MUCH WATER MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN THE NEW TRENCHES WHEN THEIR TURN
CAME TO OCCUPY THEM THE GERMANS WERE DEVOTING SOME OF THEIR HEAVY
ARTILLERY TO SHELLING THE LOCK OF THE AIRELA BASSE CANAL AT PONT
FIXE BETWEEN GIVENCHY AND CUINCHY IN THE HOPE OF BURSTING IT AND
FLOODING THE COUNTRY THEY SPENT MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTINCH
HOWITZER SHELLS ON THAT ENDEAVOUR IN ONE DAY AND LATERLONG AFTER
THE LOCK HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY PROTECTED WITH SANDBAGSUSED TO GIVE
IT STATED DOSES OF SHELL AT REGULAR INTERVALS SIMILARLY THEY WOULD
BOMBARD ONE SPECIAL SPOT ON THE LINE NEAR BTHUNE BECAUSE ONCE IN 14
AN ARMOURED TRAIN OF OURS HAD FIRED THENCE AT THEM

THE BATTALION HAD JUST BEEN REINFORCED BY A DRAFT OF 107 MEN AND
4 OFFICERSCAPTAIN ERIC GREER LIEUTENANT BLACKERDOUGLASS 2ND
LIEUTENANT R G C YERBURGH AND 2ND LIEUTENANT S G TALLENTS
THEY WERE UNDER ORDERS TO MOVE UP TOWARDS THE FIGHTING AMONG THE
BRICKFIELDS WHICH HAD OPENED ON THE 25TH AND HAD NOT CEASED SINCE
UNOFFICIAL REPORTS DESCRIBED THE TRENCHES THEY WERE TO TAKE OVER
AS NOT VERY WET BUT OTHERWISE DAMNABLE AND ON THE 30TH JANUARY
THE BATTALION DEFINITELY MOVED FROM LOCON WITH THE 2ND COLDSTREAM
VIA BTHUNE TO CUINCHY HERE THE COLDSTREAM TOOK OVER FROM THE
2ND BRIGADE THE WHOLE LINE OF A THOUSAND YARDS OF TRENCH OCCUPIED
BY THEM THE IRISH FURNISHING SUPPORTS THE REST OF THE BRIGADE
THAT IS TO SAY THE HERTS TERRITORIALS THE GRENADIERS AND THE 3RD
COLDSTREAM WERE AT ANNEQUIN BEUVRY AND BTHUNE

THE COMPANIES WERE DISPOSED BETWEEN THE LA BASSEBTHUNE ROAD
AND THE RAILWAY BESIDE THE AIRELA BASSE CANAL THE CENTRE OF
THEIR LINE CONSISTED OF A COLLECTION OF HUGE DULL PLUMCOLOURED
BRICKSTACKS MOTTLED WITH BLACK WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORIGINALLY
THIRTY FEET HIGH FIVE OF THESE WERE HELD BY OUR PEOPLE AND THE
OTHERS BY THE ENEMYTHE WHOLE CONNECTED AND INTERLOCKED BY SAPS AND
COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES NEW AND OLD WITHOUT KEY OR FINALITY NEITHER
SIDE COULD LIVE IN COMFORT AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS UNTIL THEY HAD
STRENGTHENED THEIR LINES EITHER BY LOCAL ATTACKS BOMBING RAIDS OR
SYSTEMATISED ARTILLERY WORK THE WHOLE POSITION AN OFFICER REMARKS
PROFESSIONALLY IS MOST INTERESTING AND REQUIRES CAREFUL HANDLING

EXCEPT FOR RAILWAY EMBANKMENTS AND CULVERTS THE COUNTRY ABOUT WAS SO
FLAT THAT A BULLET ONCE STARTED HAD NO REASON TO STOP THE MEN WERE
BILLETED IN SOLIDBUILT FLEMISH HOUSES WITH BULLETPROOF PARTITIONS
AND THEREFORE UNLESS NOTICEABLY SHELLED WERE INCLINED TO WALK ABOUT
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES IN THE DAYLIGHT TILL THEY WERE STERNLY SET
TO WORK TO CLEAN THEIR BILLETS OF MONTHS OF ACCUMULATIONS OF REFUSE
AND TO BURY NEGLECTED CARCASES WAR AND ALL CONNECTED WITH IT WAS
INFINITELY STALE ALREADY BUT HOUSES AND THE RUINS OF THEM HAD NOT
YET BEEN WHOLLY WIPED OUT IN THAT SECTOR

THEY WERE INSTALLED BY THE LAST DAY OF THE MONTH WITH NO GREATER
INCONVENIENCE THAN DRIFTS OF STRAY BULLETS OVER THE SUPPORT TRENCHES
AND UNSYSTEMATIC SHELLING OF BATTALION HEADQUARTERS TWO OR THREE
HUNDRED YARDS IN THE REAR AND SOME DESULTORY BOMBING IN THE
COMPLICATED FRONT LINE

EARLY IN THE MORNING OF THE 1ST FEBRUARY A POST HELD BY THE
COLDSTREAM IN A HOLLOW NEAR THE EMBANKMENT JUST WEST OF THE RAILWAY
TRIANGLEA SPOT UNHOLY BEYOND MOST EVEN IN THIS SECTORWAS BOMBED
AND RUSHED BY THE ENEMY THROUGH AN OLD COMMUNICATIONTRENCH NO 4
COMPANY IRISH GUARDS WAS ORDERED TO HELP THE COLDSTREAMS ATTACK THE
MEN WERE LED BY LIEUTENANT BLACKERDOUGLASS WHO HAD BUT REJOINED ON
THE 25TH JANUARY HE WAS KNOCKED OVER BY A BOMB WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF
THE GERMAN BARRICADE TO THE TRENCH PICKED HIMSELF UP AND WENT ON
ONLY TO BE SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD A MOMENT LATER LIEUTENANT LEE OF
THE SAME COMPANY WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEART THE COMPANY COMMANDER
CAPTAIN LONGINNES AND 2ND LIEUTENANT BLOM WERE WOUNDED AND THE
COMMAND DEVOLVED ON CQMS CARTON WHO IN SPITE OF A VERBAL ORDER
TO RETIRE WHICH HE DID NOT BELIEVE HELD ON TILL THE MORNING IN THE
TRENCH UNDER SUCH COVER OF SHELLHOLES AND HASTY BARRICADES AS COULD
BE FOUND OR PUT UP THE GERMANS WERE TOO WELL POSTED TO BE MOVED
BY BOMB OR RIFLE SO WHEN DAYLIGHT SHOWED THE SITUATION OUR BIG
GUNS WERE CALLED UPON TO SHELL FOR TEN MINUTES WITH SHRAPNEL THE
HOLLOW WHERE THEY LAY THE SPECTACLE WAS SICKENING BUT THE RESULTS
WERE SATISFACTORY THEN A SECOND ATTACK OF SOME FIFTY COLDSTREAM AND
THIRTY IRISH GUARDS OF NO 1 COMPANY UNDER LIEUTENANTS GRAHAM AND
INNES WENT FORWARD HUNG FOR A MOMENT ON THE FRINGE OF THEIR OWN
SHRAPNELFOR BARRAGES WERE NEW THINGSAND SWEPT UP THE TRENCH IT
WAS HERE THAT LANCECORPORAL OLEARY LIEUTENANT INNESS ORDERLY
WON HIS VC HE RUSHED UP ALONG THE RAILWAY EMBANKMENT ABOVE THE
TRENCHES SHOT DOWN 5 GERMANS BEHIND THEIR FIRST BARRICADE IN
THE TRENCH THEN 3 MORE TRYING TO WORK A MACHINEGUN AT THE NEXT
BARRICADE FIFTY YARDS FARTHER ALONG THE TRENCH AND TOOK A COUPLE
OF PRISONERS EYEWITNESSES REPORT THAT HE DID HIS WORK QUITE
LEISURELY AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE OPEN VISIBLE FOR ANY DISTANCE
AROUND INTENT UPON KILLING ANOTHER GERMAN TO WHOM HE HAD TAKEN A
DISLIKE MEANTIME GRAHAM BADLY WOUNDED IN THE HEAD AND INNES
TOGETHER WITH SOME COLDSTREAM HAD WORKED THEIR WAY INTO THE POST AND
FOUND IT DESERTED OUR GUNS AND OUR ATTACK HAD ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT
30 DEAD BUT HAD LEFT 32 WOUNDED AND UNWOUNDED PRISONERS ALL OF
WHOM WITH ONE EXCEPTION WEPT ALOUD THE HOLLOW WAS FULL OF MIXED
DEADCOLDSTREAM IRISH AND GERMAN

THE MEN WHO REMAINED OF NO 4 COMPANY DID NOT SETTLE DOWN TO
THE WORK OF CONSOLIDATING THEIR POSITION TILL THEY HAD FOUND
BLACKERDOUGLASSS BODY AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HIS COMPANY HAD BEEN
WOUNDED IN THE FIRST ATTACK WHILE TRYING TO BRING IT AWAY LEES BODY
WAS RECOVERED NOT FAR OFF

A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER THE POST HAD FALLEN THE ENGINEERS WERE
UP WITH UNLIMITED SANDBAGS AND HELPED THE MEN WHO WORKED AS THEY
ATE AMONG THE PILED HORRORS AROUND THEM WHILE EVERYTHING WAS MADE
READY FOR THE EXPECTED GERMAN COUNTERATTACK IT DID NOT COME NOT
ONLY HAD THE POST BEEN ABANDONED BUT ALSO A COUPLE OF TRENCHES
RUNNING OUT OF IT TO THE SOUTHWARD THESE WERE DULY BARRICADED IN
CASE THE ENEMY WERE MINDED TO WORK BACK ALONG THEM AT DUSK BUT FOR
THE REST OF THE DAY THEY PREFERRED TO SHELL KILLING 2 AND WOUNDING
5 MEN OF THE TWO COMPANIES WHICH WERE RELIEVED BY A COMPANY OF THE
3RD COLDSTREAM AND ONE OF THE 3RD GRENADIERS OUR MEN RETURNED TO
BILLETS VERY TIRED AND HUNGRY BUT VERY PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES
THAT DAYS WORK HAD COST US 2 OFFICERS AND 8 MEN KILLED 3 OFFICERS
AND 24 MEN WOUNDED AND 2 MEN MISSING IN RETURN TWO MACHINEGUNS
8 WHOLE AND 24 WOUNDED PRISONERS HAD BEEN TAKEN THE POST RECOVERED
AND PERHAPS SIXTY YARDS OF ADDITIONAL TRENCH WITH IT SUCH WAS THE
PRICE PAID IN THOSE YEARS FOR MAINTAINING EVEN A FOOTHOLD AGAINST THE
MASSED PRESSURE OF THE ENEMY IT IS DISTINCTLY NOTED IN THE DIARY
THAT TWO COMPLETE MACHINEGUNS WERE ADDED TO THE DEFENCE OF THE
POST AFTER IT HAD BEEN RECAPTURED MACHINEGUNS WERE THEN VALUABLE
ARTICLES OF BARTER FOR WHEN THE FRENCH WHO WERE THEIR NEIGHBOURS
WISHED TO BORROW ONE SUCH ARTICLE FOR MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT
A BRIGADIERGENERALS PERMISSION HAD TO BE OBTAINED

THIS EXPERIENCE HAD SHOWN IT WAS BETTER FOR EACH BATTALION IN THE
LINE TO PROVIDE ITS OWN SUPPORTS AND THEY REORGANIZED ON THE 2ND
FEBRUARY ON THIS BASIS THE 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM GUARDS TAKING OVER
THE LEFT HALF OF THE LINE UP TO WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF THE KEEP WHILE
FOR THEIR RIGHT TO THE MAIN LA BASSE ROAD THE 2ND GRENADIERS AND
THE IRISH GUARDS WERE RESPONSIBLEEACH WITH TWO COMPANIES IN THE
FIRE TRENCH AND TWO IN SUPPORT AND ALL ON FORTYEIGHT HOURS RELIEF

THE ENEMY CONTINUED TO SHELL THE CAPTURED POSITION KILLING 2 AND
WOUNDING 9 MEN THAT DAY BUT NO COUNTERATTACK DEVELOPED AND A FEW
DAYS LATER IT WAS DECIDED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE FRONT THEN HELD
BY THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE THE FIGHTING ON THE 25TH HAD LEFT IT
RUNNING IRREGULARLY THROUGH THE BIG BRICKYARD BEFORE MENTIONED OF
THE DOZEN OR MORE SOLID STACKS OF BRICK FOUR OR FIVE CONNECTED BY
A PARAPET OF LOOSE BRICKS AND KNOWN AS THE KEEP WERE IN OUR HANDS
THE OTHER EIGHT IRREGULARLY SPACED MADE A MOST AWKWARD WEDGE INTO
OUR LINE THEY WERE BACKED BY A LABYRINTH OF GERMAN TRENCHWORK AND
BEING SHELLPROOF SUPPORTS COULD BE MASSED BEHIND THEM IN PERFECT
SAFETY THE NEAREST WERE WITHIN BOMBING DISTANCE OF THE KEEP AND IN
THOSE DAYS THE GERMANS HAD MORE AND BETTER BOMBS THAN WE ON EVERY
ACCOUNT THEN THE WEDGE HAD TO BE CLEARED THE STACKS AND THEIR
CONNECTING TRENCHES OVERRUN AND THE LINE ADVANCED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
YARDS OR SO TO GET A BETTER FIELD OF FIRE AS A PRELIMINARY A SMALL
BUT NECESSARY PIECE OF GERMAN TRENCH ON THE FLANKS OF THE KEEP WAS
CAPTURED BY THE IRISH ON THE 5TH FEBRUARY WITH A LOSS OF BUT 2 KILLED
AND NONE WOUNDED

AT 2 P M ON THE 6TH OF FEBRUARY THE STACKS WERE HEAVILY BOMBARDED
FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOURA LARGE ALLOWANCE EVEN MOTHER A
NEIGHBOURING 92 PROBABLY OF NAVAL EXTRACTION TOOK PART IN IT
AND SOME FRENCH ARTILLERY RINGED THE APPROACHES ON THE GERMAN SIDE
WITH SCREENS OF BLACK MELENITE FUMES WHILE NO 2 COMPANY FROM
THE FRONT TRENCHES SWEPT THE GERMAN PARAPET FACING THEM WITH FIVE
MINUTES OF THAT OLD RAPID FIRE WHICH THE GERMANS IN THE SALIENT
AND ELSEWHERE HAD SO OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR MACHINEGUN WORK THEN TWO
ASSAULTING PARTIES OF THIRTY MEN EACH FROM NOS 3 AND 1 COMPANIES
UNDER 2ND LIEUTENANT T MUSGRAVE AND J RALLI OPENED THE ATTACK ON
FIVE OF THE EIGHT STACKS THE OTHER THREE WERE FAIRLY DEALT WITH ON
THE SAME LINES BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AS THERE WAS NO WIRE LEFT ON
THE TRENCH BEFORE OUR STACKS OUR PARTY GOT THERE ALMOST AT ONCE
BUT MUSGRAVE AHEAD OF HIS MEN WAS SHOT BY A GROUP OF FIVE GERMANS
WHO SHOWED FIGHT BEHIND A FEW FATAL UNBROKEN STRANDS IN THE REAR
THEY WERE ALL KILLED A MOMENT LATER WHEN THE MEN CAME UP THEN THE
SUPPORTING PARTIES UNDER LIEUTENANT INNES WERE SLIPPED TOGETHER
WITH THE ENGINEERS UNDER MAJOR FOWKES RE AND THE COMBINED ATTACK
SWEPT ON THROUGH THE BRICKSTACKS IN AND OUT OF THE TRENCHES AND
AROUND AND BEHIND THEM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE SHOT AND BAYONETED AS
FOUND TILLFIGHTING DIGGING CURSING AND SANDBAGGINGOUR MEN HAD
HACKED THEIR WAY SOME SEVENTY YARDS BEYOND THEIR OBJECTIVE AND DUG
IN UNDER A SHELF OF RAW GROUND ABOUT THREE FEET HIGH PROBABLY THE
LIP OF AN OLD CLAYPIT OUR GUNS HAD LIFTED AND WERE CHOKING OFF ALL
ATTEMPTS AT POSSIBLE COUNTERATTACKS BUT THE GERMAN SUPPORTS SEEM
TO HAVE EVAPORATED IN THE DIRECTION OF LA BASSE THERE WAS A RIDGE
IN FRONT OF THE CAPTURED POSITION WHENCE A FEW BULLETS WERE STILL
DROPPING BUT THE BACK OF THE DEFENCE HAD BEEN BROKEN AND AS FIRING
DIMINISHED FIRST ONE AND THEN TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE MEN WERE SET
DIGGING IN AND FILLING SANDBAGS THE FORTUNES OF THE LITTLE CAMPAIGN
HAD GONE SMOOTHLY AND WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY IN THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE
OF THE TRENCHWORK TO BRING UP REINFORCEMENTS OR MORE SHOVELS AND
AMMUNITION FOR THE DIGGINGPARTIES THE INDEFATIGABLE AND BROTHERLY
HERTS TERRITORIALS WERE DRAWN UPON THE COLDSTREAM HAD CARRIED THEIR
SHARE OF THE FRONT AND LAY IN LINE ON OUR LEFT AND AT DUSK WHILE
THE ENGINEERS WERE PUTTING UP MORE WIRE UNDER RIFLEFIRE AT 150
YARDS RANGE THE POSITION WAS SECURE

OUR CASUALTIES THANKS TO THE BOMBARDMENT AND THE SWIFTNESS OF THE
ATTACK WERE ONLY 1 OFFICER AND 6 MEN KILLED AND 25 WOUNDED FATHER
GWYNNE THE CHAPLAIN WAS SEVERELY WOUNDED BY A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL
WHILE WATCHING THE ATTACK FROM AN OBSERVATIONPOST WHICH AS THE
FATHER UNDERSTOOD IT MEANT AS FAR FORWARD AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER
THAT HE MIGHT BE READY TO GIVE COMFORT TO THE DYING THE COLDSTREAM
GATHERED IN TWENTYEIGHT PRISONERS THE IRISH NONE BUT AMONG THEIR
SPOILS IS ENTERED ONE IRON CROSS WON RATHER PICTURESQUELY AT THE
OPENING OF THE RUSH THE GERMANS MADE A CLOSERANGE BOMBINGRAID ON
ONE OF THE CORNERS OF THE KEEP AND AT LAST PITCHED A BOMB ON TO THE
TOP OF A SANDBAG REDOUBT THIS SO ANNOYED ONE OF OUR BOMBTHROWERS
A GIANT OF THE NAME OF HENNIGAN OF NO 1 COMPANY THAT HE PICKED UP
A TRENCHMORTAR BOMB NO TRINKET WHICH LAY CONVENIENT CUT DOWN THE
FUSE FOR SHORT RANGE AND THREW IT AT A SPOT WHERE HE HAD CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE OF A GERMAN OFFICER THE BOMB BURST ALMOST BEFORE IT REACHED
THE GROUND AND MUST HAVE MADE A DIRECT HIT FOR NOTHING UPON THE
OFFICER WAS RECOGNISABLE LATER SAVE THE IRON CROSS WHICH IN DUE TIME
WENT TO THE REGIMENTAL ORDERLY ROOM HENNIGAN WAS AWARDED THE DCM
FOR HIS BOMB ALSO BLEW IN AND BLOCKED UP THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCH
THROUGH WHICH THE BOMBERS CAMEA MATTER WHICH HE REGARDED AS A
SIDEISSUE COMPARED TO HIS SPLENDID BOWLIN

THE COMPANIES WERE RELIEVED IN THE EVENING BY A COMPANY OF
GRENADIERS AND AS THEY WANDERED BACK THROUGH THE NEWTAKEN TRENCHES
IN THE WINTER DUSK LOST THEIR WAY AMONG ALL MANNER OF HORRORS
ONE OFFICER WROTE I FELL OVER AND BECAME INVOLVED IN A KIND OF
WRESTLINGMATCH WITH A SHAPELESS THING THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A DEAD
MAN WITHOUT A HEAD  AND SO BACK TO BEUVRY VERY TIRED AND SAD FOR
THE DEATH OF TOMMY MUSGRAVE

THERE WERE OTHER CASUALTIES THAT MOVED LAUGHTER UNDER THE RIBS OF
DEATH A MAN REPORTED AFTER THE ACTION THAT HIS TEETH WERE ALL BROKE
ON HIM HIS COMPANY OFFICER NATURALLY EXPRESSED SYMPATHY BUT SOME
SURPRISE AT NOT SEEING A BULLETHOLE THROUGH BOTH CHEEKS I TOOK
THEM OUT AND PUT THEM IN MY POCKET FOR THE CHARGE SORR AND THEY
ALL BROKE ON ME WAS THE REPLY WELL GO TO THE DOCTOR AND SEE IF
HE CAN GET YOU A NEW SET IVE BEEN TO HIM SORR AND ITS LITTLE
SYMPATHY I GOT HE JUST GAVE ME A PILL AND CHASED ME AWAY SORR

A WEIRD ATTEMPT WAS MADE AT DAYBREAK ON THE 7TH FEBRUARY BY A FORLORN
HOPE OF SOME FIFTY GERMANS TO CHARGE THE NEWLY INSTALLED LINE AT A
POINT WHERE THE COLDSTREAM AND 2ND GRENADIERS JOINED THEY DASHED
OUT ACROSS THE GROUND FROM BEHIND A STACK THE OFFICER WAVING HIS
SWORD AND WERE ALL KILLED OR WOUNDED ON OR CLOSE UP TO OUR WIRE MEN
SAID THERE SEEMED NO MEANING OR REASON IN THE AFFAIR UNLESS IT WAS
A SUICIDEPARTY OF GERMANS WHO HAD RUN FROM THE ATTACK OF THE DAY
BEFORE AND HAD BEEN ORDERED THUS TO DIE ONE OF THEIR WOUNDED LAY OUT
ALL DAY AND WHEN THE IRISH WERE TAKING OVER THE RELIEF ON THE 8TH
SOME GERMANS SHOUTED LOUDLY FROM THEIR TRENCHES AND ONE STOOD UP
AND POINTED TO THE WOUNDED MAN SAID THE GRENADIERS WHO WERE BEING
RELIEVED COME AND GET HIM A COUPLE OF GERMAN STRETCHERBEARERS
CAME OUT AND BORE THEIR COMRADE AWAY NOT THIRTY YARDS FROM OUR
TRENCH WHILE OUR MEN HELD THEIR FIRE

IN THE SAME RELIEF IT FELL TO THE IRISH TO EXAMINE THE BODY OF A
SINGLE GERMAN WHO HAD CREPT UP AND OF A SUDDEN PEERED INTO OUR
FRONTLINE TRENCH WHERE A GRENADIER PROMPTLY SHOT HIM HE DROPPED ON
THE EDGE OF THE PARAPET AND LAY LIKE A MAN PRAYING SINCE HE HAD
NO RIFLE IT WAS ASSUMED HE WAS A BOMBER BUT AFTER DARK THEY FOUND
HE WAS WHOLLY UNARMED AT ALMOST THE SAME HOUR OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
ANOTHER GERMAN CAME TO PRECISELY THE SAME END IN THE SAME POSTURE
ON THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE LINE WHETHER THESE TWO WERE DESERTERS OR
SCOUTS WHO WOULD PRETEND TO BE DESERTERS IF CAPTURED WAS NEVER
SETTLED THE TRENCHES WERE FULL OF SUCH MYSTERIES STRANGE TRADES
TOO WERE DRIVEN THERE A MAN NOW GONE TO VALHALLA FOR HE WAS
UTTERLY BRAVE DID NOT APPROVE OF LETTING DEAD GERMANS LIE UNVISITED
BEFORE THE LINES HE WOULD MARK THE BODY DOWN IN THE COURSE OF HIS
DAYS WORK THRUST A STICK IN THE PARADOS TO GIVE HIM HIS DIRECTION
AND AT NIGHT OR PREFERABLY WHEN THE MORNING FOG LAY HEAVY ON THE
LANDSCAPE WOULD SLIP ACROSS TO HIS QUARRY AND RETURN WITH HIS
POCKETS FILLED WITH LOOT MANY OFFICERS HAD SEEN CS STICK AT
THE BACK OF THE TRENCH SOME LIVING MAY LIKE TO LEARN NOW WHY IT WAS
THERE6

A DRAFT OF ONE HUNDRED MEN MAKING GOOD THE WEEKS LOSSES CAME IN
ON THE 8TH FEBRUARY UNDER CAPTAIN G E YOUNG LIEUTENANTS T ALLEN
AND C PEASE AND 2ND LIEUTENANT V W D FOX AMONG THEM WERE MANY
WOUNDED WHO HAD RETURNED THEY FELL TO AT ONCE ON THE STRENGTHENING
AND CLEANING UP OF THE NEW LINE WHICH LAY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YARDS
FROM THE ENEMY IT SUPPORTED THE FRENCH LINE WHERE THAT JOINED ON
TO OURS AND THE OFFICERS WOULD VISIT TOGETHER THROUGH A TUNNEL
UNDER THE ROADWAY OF THIS FORLORN PART OF THE WORLD THERE IS A TALE
THAT STANDS BEST AS IT WAS WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE
BATTALION AND WHILE WE WERE BARRICADING WITH SANDBAGS WHERE THE
OLD TRENCH JOINED THE ROAD A DEAD COLDSTREAM LYING AGAINST A TREE
WATCHED US WITH DULL UNOBSERVANT EYES WHILE WE WERE TRUDGING
ALONG THE PAV MORTALLY WEARY AFTER RELIEF SAID THE SERGEANT
TO ME DID YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT YOU SAW THAT DEAD
MAN BY THE TREE SIR WELL THE COVERINGPARTY THEY LAY ALL ROUND
HIM ONE OF THEM TAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AN ASKED HIM IF HE WERE
ASLEEP AND PRESENTLY THE CSM THAT CAME DOWN WITH THE RELIEF HE
WHISPERED TO THE CORPORAL HOW MANY MEN HAVE YE GOT OUT CORPORAL
FIVE SIR SAYS THE CORPORAL I CAN SEE SIX MESELF SAYS THE
CSM FIVE BELONG TO ME SAYS THE CORPORAL COUNT EM LAD
SAYS THE CSM FIVE CAME OUT WITH ME SAYS THE CORPORAL AND THE
SIXTH FAITH TIS COLD HE IS WITH WATCHING US EVERY NIGHT THIS SIX
WEEKS

FOR A WHILE THE DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE PEACEFUL AS PEACE WAS COUNTED
ROUND THE BRICKSTACKS THE UNSPEAKABLY FOUL GERMAN TRENCHES WERE
SUPPLEMENTED WITH NEW ONES COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES MULTIPLIED AND
MARKED WITH PROPER SIGNBOARDS AND SUCH HISTORIC MAINARTERIES
AS THE OLD KENT ROAD TRENCH PAVED WITH BRICKS FROM THE STACKS
BY NIGHT THE FRONT LINE SAT AND SHIVERED ROUND BRAZIERS IN THE
FREEZING DARK WHILE BITS OF NEWMADE TRENCH FELL AROUND THEM AND
LISTENINGPOSTS AT THE HEAD OF OLD SAPS AND BARRICADED ALLEYS
REPORTED IMAGINARY NIGHTATTACKS WHEN THEY WORKED ON A CAPTURED
TRENCH THEY WERE LIKE AS NOT TO FIND IT BOTTOMED OR WORSE STILL
REVETTED WITH AN ENEMY CORPSE WHICH THE SLIDING MUD WOULD DELIVER
HIDEOUSLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE PARTY ON SUCH OCCASIONS THE SENSITIVE
WOULD BE SICK WHILE THE MORE HARDENED WARMED AND ATE THEIR FOOD
UNPERTURBED AMID ALL THE OFFAL BUT THERE WERE COMPENSATIONS

ON THE 11TH FEBRUARY FOR EXAMPLE IT IS NOTED THAT THE MEN HAD BAKED
MEAT AND SUET PUDDING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE WAR BEGAN
ON THE 13TH NOT ONE MAN WAS EVEN WOUNDED THROUGH THE WHOLE DAY
AND NIGHT WHILE ON THE 15TH MORE THAN HALF THE BATTALION HAD HOT
BATHS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JANUARY THE DIARIES RECORD THESE
FACTS AS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH A SMALL ADVANCE BY THE FRENCH ON
THEIR RIGHT WHO CAPTURED A TRENCH BUT FELL INTO A NEST OF ANGRY
MACHINEGUNS AND HAD TO RETIRE THE BATTALIONS SHARE IN THE WORK WAS
BUT TO ASSIST IN KEEPING THE ENEMYS HEADS DOWN IN RETURN FOR WHICH
THE GERMANS SHELLED THEM AN HOUR KILLING 1 AND WOUNDING 5 OUR MEN
PERSISTED IN UNDERCUTTING THE SIDES OF THE TRENCH TO MAKE DUGOUTS
IN THE BELIEF THAT UNSUPPORTED CAVES OF EARTH WERE SAFE AGAINST HIGH
EXPLOSIVES TIMBERS AND FRAMING INDEED MATERIAL OF ANY KIND WERE
STILL SCARCE AND DOORS AND BOARDS FROM WRECKED HOUSES WERE USED IN
ERECTING PARAPETS SANDBAGS WERE MADE OUT OF OLD PETTICOATS AND
PYJAMAS AND THE FARMERS FENCES SUPPLIED AN INDIFFERENT SORT OF
WIRE SANDBAGS WIRES AND STAKES DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE FRONT IN
APPRECIABLE QUANTITIES TILL THE SPRING OF 1915 AND TELEPHONES ABOUT
THE SAME DATE THERE WAS NO ABUNDANCE OF ANY OF THESE THINGS TILL
LATE IN 1915 FOR THE COUNTRY HAD NOT MADE ANY PREPARATION FOR WAR
TILL WAR BEGAN AND THE PRICE OF THIS WAS THE LIVES OF MEN

THE SIMPLICITY OF OUR BATTERYWORK IS SHOWN BY THE JOYOUS STATEMENT
THAT WE NOW HAVE A GUNNER OFFICER TO LIVE WITH US IN OUR
HEADQUARTERS IN THE TRENCHES AND A TELEPHONE TO THE BATTERY SO THAT
FIRE CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR QUICKLY ON ANY PART OF OUR FRONT AS
NECESSITY ARISES AT TIMES THERE WOULD BE AN ERROR IN THE SIGNALS
WHEREBY THE BATTALION COMING UP FROM BILLETS TO THE TRENCHES THROUGH
THE DARK WOULD BE URGED TO MAKE HASTE BECAUSE THEIR SECTION WAS BEING
ATTACKED AND AFTER A BREATHLESS ARRIVAL WOULD FIND THE ARTILLERY
BUSIED ON SOME SMALL AFFAIR AWAY ON A FLANK

CHARACTERISTICALLY ENOUGH THE GERMANS WHEN BOMBARDED AS THEY
WERE WITH EFFECT BY THE FRENCH WOULD RETALIATE BY SHELLING OUR
LINES THE SHELLS WORRIED THE IRISH LESS THAN THE FACT THAT THREE
OF THEIR OFFICERSMAJOR THE EARL OF ROSSE LIEUTENANT RANKIN AND
2ND LIEUTENANT D PARSONS WHO ARRIVED AT 2 A M WITH A DRAFT FROM
HOME WERE FOUND TO BE TEMPORARILY ATTACHED TO THE SCOTS GUARDS
AT THAT TIME THE BATTALION WAS 25 OFFICERS AND 900 MEN STRONG AND
THE WASTAGE FROM SNIPERS AND SHELLS BOTH IN THE TRENCH AND WHILE
RELIEVING WAS NOT MORE THAN SIX DAILY

THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THE ENEMY WAS NOW MINING UNDER THE
BRICKSTACKS SO A MINING COMPANY WAS FORMED AND AN OFFICER
EXPERIMENTED SUCCESSFULLY IN FIRING RIFLEGRENADES POINTBLANK FROM
THE RIFLE INSTEAD OF PARABOLICALLY WHICH ALLOWED THE ENEMY TIME TO
SEE THEM DESCENDING THIS WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A FEW PERSISTENT
SNIPERS SEVENTY YARDS AWAY WHO WERE EFFECTIVELY MOVED AND THEIR
DUGOUT SET ABLAZE BY THE NEW FORM OF ATTACK

TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH OUR MEN HAD FINISHED THEIR
TRENCHCLEANINGS AND BRICKINGSUP HAD BURIED ALL DEAD THAT COULD
BE GOT AT AND WORD WENT ROUND THAT IF THE SITUATION ON THE 25TH
FEBRUARY COULD BE CONSIDERED HEALTHY THE PRINCE OF WALES WOULD
VISIT THEM THE GERMANS PERHAPS ON INFORMATION RECEIVED FOR THE
BACKAREAS WERE THRONGED WITH SPIES CHOSE THAT DAY TO BE VERY
ACTIVE WITH A SMALL GUN AND AS A FRESH TRENCH LINKING UP WITH THE
FRENCH ON THE LA BASSE ROAD HAD BEEN MADE AND WAS VISIBLE AGAINST
SOME NEWFALLEN SNOW THEY SHELLED THAT TOO FOR THIS REASON THE
PRINCE WAS NOT TAKEN QUITE UP TO THE FRONT LINE AT WHICH HE WAS
RATHER ANNOYED THE PRECAUTION WAS REASONABLE ENOUGH A FEW MINUTES
AFTER HE HAD LEFT A SECTOR JUDGED COMPARATIVELY SAFE 2ND LIEUTENANT
T ALLEN WAS KILLED BY A SHELL PITCHING ON THE PARAPET THERE THREE
PRIVATES WERE ALSO KILLED AND 4 WOUNDED BY SHELL OR BOMB ON THAT
HEALTHY DAY THE SAME GUN WHICH HAD BEEN GIVING TROUBLE DURING
THE PRINCES VISIT WAS THOUGHT TO BE LOCATED BY FLASH SOMEWHERE ON
THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LA BASSE ROAD AND SIEGEHOWITZERS KEPT IT
SUBDUED TILL THE EVENING OF THE 25TH WHEN WITH THE USUAL GERMAN
SCRUPULOSITY IT BEGAN TO SHELL THE MAIN ROAD BY WHICH RELIEFS CAME
AT TENMINUTE INTERVALS FOR THREE HOURS BUT WITH NO CASUALTIES AS
FAR AS THE IRISH WERE CONCERNED ONE SHELL DULY NOTED ARRIVED
NEAR BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS AND A BATTERY OF OURS WAS ASKED TO ABATE
THE NUISANCE IT IS CURIOUS THAT ONLY A FEW HOURS LATER THE GERMANS
WERE SHELLING A FRENCH BATTERY NOT FAR FROM BTHUNE WITH TENINCH
STUFF WHICH IF EXPENDED ON THE MAIN ROAD WOULD HAVE DISORGANISED
OUR RELIEFS VERY COMPLETELY THIS WAS ON THE EVE OF GOING INTO CORPS
RESERVE AT BTHUNE WHERE THE BATTALION TOOK OVER THE COLLGE DE
JEUNES FILLES FROM THE WORCESTERS THE BEST BILLETS SINCE THE WAR
BEGAN BUT ALAS FURNISHED WITH A LARGE SQUARE WHERE DRILL CAN TAKE
PLACE

THE MONTHS LOSSES HAD BEEN 4 OFFICERS AND 34 MEN KILLED 5 OFFICERS
AND 85 MEN WOUNDED OR 128 MEN IN ALL

AT BTHUNE THEY ENJOYED NINE DAYS REST WITH STEADY DRILL AND
ROUTEMARCHES CONCERTS IN THE LOCAL THEATRE INTERREGIMENTAL
BOXING WITH THE 2ND GRENADIERS AND A DIVISIONAL FOOTBALL COMPETITION
FOR A CUP PRESENTED BY THE BISHOP OF KHARTUM HERE THEY DEFEATED THE
6TH FIELD AMBULANCE AND LOST BY TWO GOALS TO NIL TO THE OXFORD AND
BUCKS LI MAJOR TREFUSIS CO CAPTAIN MYLNE AND 2ND LIEUTENANT
H MARIONCRAWFORD WENT HOME FOR A WEEKS LEAVEFOR THAT WONDERFUL
EXPERIENCE OF FIRST LEAVE WAS NOW AVAILABLEWHILE MAJOR THE EARL
OF ROSSE WHO HAD BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE SCOTS GUARDS TOOK OVER
COMMAND


NEUVE CHAPELLE

BY THE 9TH MARCH EVERY ONE HAD RETURNED AND WITH THEM A DRAFT OF A
HUNDRED MEN UNDER LIEUTENANT C WYNTER 2ND LIEUTENANT T E NUGENT
AND 2ND LIEUTENANT HON W S P ALEXANDER JUST IN TIME TO TAKE
THEIR SHARE IN THE OPERATIONS BEFORE NEUVE CHAPELLE

THIS VILLAGE WHICH LAY FOUR MILES UNDER THE AUBERS RIDGE AT THE
ENTRANCE TO THE OPEN COUNTRY ROUND LILLE AND TOURCOING HAD BEEN IN
GERMAN HANDS SINCE SMITHDORRIENS CORPS WERE TURNED OUT OF IT ON
OCTOBER 26TH AND 27TH OF THE YEAR BEFORE ASSUMING THAT OUR TROOPS
COULD BREAK THROUGH AT THAT POINT THAT NO REINFORCEMENTS COULD BE
BROUGHT UP BY THE GERMANS OVER ALL THEIR WELLCONSIDERED LINES OF
COMMUNICATION THAT THE AUBERS RIDGE COULD BE SURROUNDED AND HELD
THAT CAVALRY COULD FOLLOW UP INFANTRY ARMED WITH MACHINEGUNS ACROSS
TRENCHES AND THROUGH COUNTRY STUDDED WITH FORTIFIED POSTS IT WAS
CONSIDERED IN SOME QUARTERS THAT AN ATTACK MIGHT BE DRIVEN THROUGH
EVEN TO LILLE ITSELF

OUR ARMIES PENNED FOR MONTHS IN THE TRENCHES HAD SUFFERED HEAVY
WASTAGE THOUGH THEY WERE BEING BUILT UP FROM BEHIND WITH MEN
MATERIAL AND GUNS ON A SCALE WHICH BY ALL PAST STANDARDS WAS
ENORMOUS THE ENEMY WITH INFINITELY LARGER RESOURCES HAD MEANTIME
STRENGTHENED AND RESTRENGTHENED HIMSELF BEHIND BELT UPON BELT OF
BARBED WIRE WITH UNCOUNTED MACHINEGUN POSTS AND AN ARTILLERY OF
HIGH EXPLOSIVES TO WHICH THE WORLD THEN HELD NO EQUAL HIS HAND WAS
HEAVY TOO IN OFFENCE AND THE FRENCH ARMIES TO THE EASTWARD FELT IT
AS SOON AS THE SPRING OPENED TO EASE THAT PRESSURE TO RELEASE OUR
TROOPS FROM THE BURDEN OF MERE WASTEFUL WAITING AND TO BREAK AS FAR
AS MIGHT BE THE EDGE OF THE ENEMY AT THE OUTSET OF THE 15 CAMPAIGN
WERE PRESUMABLY OBJECTS OF THE BATTLE ONLY SECOND TO THE SOMEWHAT
AMBITIOUS PROJECT OF ENTERING LILLE

NEUVE CHAPELLE PROVED IN LARGE WHAT THE MEN IN THE TRENCHES HAD
LEARNED IN LITTLE THROUGHOUT THE WINTERTHAT UNLESS ARTILLERY
UTTERLY ROOT OUT BARBEDWIRE TRENCHES MACHINEGUN POSTS AND
FORTIFIED HOUSES NO VALOUR OF ATTACKING INFANTRY CAN PIERCE A MODERN
DEFENSIVE LINE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED GUNSSAY 5 PER CENT OF
THE NUMBER THAT OUR ARMIES HAD IN THE LAST YEARS OF THE WAROPENED
UPON NEUVE CHAPELLE AND ITS DEFENCES AT 730 ON THE MORNING OF MARCH
10 FOR HALF AN HOUR IN A BOMBARDMENT WITHOUT PARALLEL WHERE THE
FIRE FELL IT WIPED OUT EVERYTHING ABOVE THE SODDEN MUDDY GROUND
SO UTTERLY BREAKING THE DEFENCE THAT FOR A WHILE THE ATTACK OF
RAWLINSONS FOURTH ARMY CORPS WENT FORWARD WITH HARDLY A CHECK
ACROSS SHAPELESS OVERTURNED WRECKAGE OF MEN AND THINGS THEN AT ONE
POINT AFTER ANOTHER ALONG THE WHOLE BARE FRONT BATTALIONS FOUND
THEMSELVES HUNG UP BEFORE OR TRAPPED BETWEEN BREADTHS OF UNCUT WIRE
THAT COVERED NESTS OF MACHINEGUNS AND WERE WITHERED UP BEFORE ANY
ARTILLERY COULD BE WARNED TO THEIR HELP THIS WAS THE FATE OF THE
6TH BRIGADE WHOSE PART IN THE WORK ON THAT SECTOR WAS TO CAPTURE
TWO LINES OF TRENCHES IN FRONT OF GIVENCHY THREE BATTALIONS OF
THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADETHE 2ND GRENADIERS 1ST IRISH AND 2ND
COLDSTREAMWERE ATTACHED TO IT AS DIVISIONAL RESERVE AND THE
REMAINING TWO BATTALIONS OF THE BRIGADETHE 3RD COLDSTREAM GUARDS
AND THE HERTS REGIMENT UNDER COLONEL MATHESONAS CORPS RESERVE

THE BATTALION LEFT BILLETS NEAR BTHUNE IN THE EARLY DAWN OF THE 10TH
MARCH AND MOVED TO A WOOD JUST NORTH OF THE AIRELA BASSE CANAL
WHERE IT REMAINED TILL MIDNIGHT WHEN IT WENT FORWARD TO TAKE OVER
SOME TRENCHES HELD BY THE KINGS LIVERPOOL AND SOUTH STAFFORDS 6TH
BRIGADE WHOSE ATTACK HAD FAILED OUR GUNS HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED IN
BLOWING AN INADEQUATE HOLE OR TWO IN THE ENEMYS WIRE WHICH AT MANY
PLACES WAS REPORTED AS TEN YARDS DEEP AND THE ASSAULTING BATTALIONS
HAD AS USUAL BEEN HALTED THERE AND CUT DOWN THE ONLY CONSOLATION
FOR THE HEAVY LOSSES IN MEN AND OFFICERS WAS THE NEWS THAT THE ATTACK
FARTHER NORTH HAD GONE WELL AND THAT A THOUSAND GERMANS HAD BEEN
CAPTURED

A FRESH ATTACK WAS ORDERED ON THE MORNING OF THE 11TH BUT THE
BOMBARDMENT WAS DELAYED BY FOG AND DID SO LITTLE DAMAGE TO THE
WIRE THAT BY AFTERNOON THE IDEA WAS ABANDONED AND IN THE EVENING
THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE TOOK OVER THE LINE THAT HAD BEEN HELD BY
THE 6TH BRIGADE THEY WERE FILTHY TRENCHES THEIR PARAPETS WERE
NOT BULLETPROOF AND THE HOUSES BEHIND THEM BLOWN TO PIECES
HEADQUARTERS MESS LIVED IN ONE CELLAR THE CO OF THE BATTALION
SLEPT IN ANOTHER AND THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES WERE FAR TOO
SHALLOW PART OF OUR FRONT HAD TO BE EVACUATED WHILE OUR BOMBARDMENT
WAS GOING ON AS IT WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE ENEMY FOR SAFE SHELLING
THE FAILURE OF THE 6TH BRIGADES ATTACK IN THIS QUARTER REDUCED THE
NEXT DAYS OPERATION TO A HOLDING AFFAIR OF RIFLE AND HEAVYGUN
FIRE DELAYED AND HAMPERED BY THE MORNING FOG AND ON THE 13TH MARCH
THE BATTALION WENT INTO BILLETS AT LE PROL THE BATTLE ROUND NEUVE
CHAPELLE ITSELF THEY WERE TOLD HAD YIELDED MORE PRISONERS BUT
HEAVY GERMAN REINFORCEMENTS WERE BEING MOVED UP

LATE THAT NIGHT A DRAFT OF EIGHTY NCOS AND MEN ARRIVED UNDER
LIEUTENANT J S N FITZGERALD AMONG THEM THE FIRST DETACHMENT OF
SPECIALLY ENLISTED LATE RI CONSTABULARYLARGE DRILLED MENWHO
WERE TO PLAY SO SOLID A PART IN THE HISTORY AND THE GLORY OF THE
BATTALION THE STRENGTH OF THE BATTALION AT THAT MOMENT WAS 1080 WITH
SOME 26 OFFICERSMUCH GREATER THAN IT HAD BEEN AT ANY TIME DURING
THE WAR THEY WERE ALL TURNED INTO THE ENDLESS WORK OF CLEANING OUT
AND DRAINING FOUL TRENCHES AND THE DOGS LIFE OF HOLDING THEM UNDER
REGULAR AND IRREGULAR BOMBARDMENTS

IT WAS SAFER TO RELIEVE BY DAYLIGHT RATHER THAN BY NIGHT AS DARKNESS
BROUGHT BURSTS OF SUDDEN RIFLE AND MACHINEGUN FIRE DESPATCHED AT A
VENTURE FROM BEHIND THE FIVEDEEP LINE OF GERMAN CHEVAUXDEFRISE
NOT SEVENTY YARDS AWAY TEMPTING OPENINGS TOO WERE LEFT IN THE WIRE
TO INVITE ATTACK BUT THE BAIT WAS NOT TAKEN NEUVE CHAPELLE HAD BEEN
A FAILURE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT HAD SHOWN THE ENEMY THAT WINTER HAD
NOT DULLED ANY OF OUR ARMS AND IT WAS RECOGNIZED WE MUST CONTINUE
TO SIT STILL TILL MEN AND MATERIAL SHOULD ACCUMULATE BEHIND US THE
DOCUMENTS AND DIARIES OF THOSE WEEKS ADMIT THIS WITH THE UNSHAKEN
CHEERFULNESS OF THE RACE YET EVEN SO THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL
STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY WAS NOT REALISED

VERY SLOWLY AND ALWAYS WITH THE THOUGHT AT THE BACK OF THE MIND
THAT THE DEADLOCK MIGHT BREAK AT ANY MOMENT THE ARMY SET ITSELF
BATTALION BY BATTALION TO LEARN THE WAR IT WAS WAGING

ON THE 15TH OF MARCH 2ND LIEUTENANT H MARIONCRAWFORD WAS APPOINTED
BRIGADE BOMBING OFFICER TO THE GUARDS BRIGADE WITH SIXTY MEN UNDER
HIM ATTACHED TO THE IRISH GUARDS THE JAMPOT GRENADE OF 1914
WAS PRACTICALLY OBSOLETE BY NOW THE STICK HANDGRENADE OF THE
HAIRBRUSH TYPE AND THE GRENADE FIRED FROM THE RIFLE HAD SUCCEEDED IT
AND WERE APPEARING ON THE FRONT IN APPRECIABLE QUANTITIES THE MILLS
BOMB WHICH SUPERSEDED ALL OTHERS BOTH FOR HAND AND RIFLE WAS NOT
BORN TILL THE AUTUMN OF 1915 AND WAS NOT LAVISHLY SUPPLIED TILL THE
OPENING OF THE NEXT YEAR

ON THE 16TH MARCH OR FIVE DAYS AFTER THEIR SHARE OF THE BATTLE OF
NEUVE CHAPELLE HAD ENDED AND THEY LAY IN THE TRENCHES A MOANING
WAS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS OF NO MANS LAND AND A CORPORAL SENT OUT
TO REPORT HE CAME BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD GOT INTO A TRENCH SOME
THIRTY YARDS FROM THE FRONT LINE WHERE HE HAD SEEN A LIGHTED CANDLE
AND HEARD WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE GERMANS TALKING ANOTHER PATROL WAS
DESPATCHED AND AT LAST CAME BACK WITH A WOUNDED MAN OF THE KINGS
LIVERPOOLS WHO HAD BEEN LYING OUT SINCE THE 10TH HE SAID HE HAD
BEEN WOUNDED IN THE ASSAULT CAPTURED AS HE WAS TRYING TO CRAWL BACK
STRIPPED OF BOOTS EQUIPMENT AND RATIONS BUT LEFT WITH A BLANKET
AND THE ENEMY APPARENTLY VISITED HIM EVERY NIGHT AS THEY PATROLLED
THE TRENCH AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE THAT PATROL BUT IN THE
DARKNESS THE TRENCH WAS MISSED ALTOGETHER

THE ENEMY CELEBRATED THE DAY BEFORE ST PATRICKS DAY AND THE DAY
ITSELF MARCH 17 BY SEVERAL HOURS OF BRISK SHELLING OF GIVENCHY
TIMED TO CATCH THE EVENING RELIEFS BUT LUCKILY WITHOUT CASUALTIES
QUEEN ALEXANDRA SENT THE BATTALION THEIR SHAMROCK TELEGRAMS WISHING
THEM GOOD LUCK WERE DULY RECEIVED FROM LORD KITCHENER COLONEL OF THE
BATTALION BRIGADIERGENERAL NUGENT AND A LETTER FROM SIR CHARLES
MONRO COMMANDING THE FIRST ARMY CORPS FATHER GWYNNE HELD AN OPENAIR
SERVICE IN THE EARLY MORNING AND EVERY MAN WAS GIVEN A HOT BATH AT
BTHUNE MORE IMPORTANT STILL EVERY MAN WHO WANTED IT HAD FREE BEER
WITH HIS DINNER AND IN THOSE DAYS BEER WAS BEER INDEED

THE END OF THE MONTH WAS FILLED WITH CONSTRUCTIVE WORK AND THE
LINKING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF TRENCHES AND THE BURIAL WHERE
POSSIBLE OF THE VERY OLD DEADTWENTYNINE OF THEM IN ONE DAYAND
ALWAYS UNRELAXING WATCH AND WARD AGAINST THE ENEMY AT TIMES HE
PUZZLED THEM AS WHEN ONE EVENING HE THREW BOMBS JUST OVER HIS OWN
PARAPET TILL IT SEEMED THAT HE MUST BE BUSY BLOWING HOLES IN HIS
OWN DEEP WIRE BUT IT TURNED OUT AT LAST TO BE SOME NEW PATTERN OF
BOMB WITH WHICH HE WAS METHODICALLY EXPERIMENTING LATER CAME A FEW
AEROPLANES THE FIRST SEEN IN SOME WEEKS IT MAY HAVE BEEN NO MORE
THAN A COINCIDENCE THAT THE FIRST PLANES CAME OVER ON THE DAY THAT
THE PRINCE OF WALES WAS PAYING THE BATTALION ANOTHER VISIT BUT IT
WAS THE CONTINUOUS RIFLEFIRE AT NIGHT THAT ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE
CASUALTIES IN THE TRENCHES AND DURING RELIEFS SECOND LIEUTENANT T
NUGENT WAS WOUNDED IN THE BACK OF THE NECK ON THE 24TH BY AN UNAIMED
BULLET AND ALMOST EACH DAY HAD ITS COUNT OF CASUALTIES

THE BATTALION TOOK LIFE WITH PHILOSOPHIC CALM FOOD AND REST ARE THE
PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATIONS OF MEN IN WAR THE FORMER WAS CERTAIN AND
ABUNDANT THE LATTER SCANTY AND BROKEN SO THE COMMANDING OFFICER
MADE NO COMMENT WHEN ONE NIGHT GOING ROUND THE LINE HE FOUND A MAN
DEEPLY ASLEEP WITH HIS FEET PROJECTING INTO THE FAIRWAY AND WRITTEN
ON A PAPER ON HIS CHEST THE LEGEND

SLEEP IS SWEET UNDISTURBED IT IS DIVINE
SO LIFT UP YOUR FEET AND DO NOT TREAD ON MINE

A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHANGE AND INTEREST WAS GIVEN BY THE APPEARANCE
ON THE SCENE OF THE POST OFFICE TERRITORIALS 8TH CITY OF LONDON
COMMANDED BY COLONEL J HARVEY AN EXIRISH GUARDSMAN AND A PLATOON
OF THAT REGIMENT WAS ATTACHED TO THE BATTALION FOR INSTRUCTIONAL
PURPOSES LATER THREE AND AT LAST SEVEN PLATOONS WERE PLACED AT
THE DISPOSAL OF THE IRISH GUARDS WHOSE CO FOUND THEM WORK TO DO
THEY MADE THEMSELVES QUITE USEFUL BUT WANTED MORE PRACTICE IN
DIGGINGAN EXPERIENCE NEVER BEGRUDGED THEM BY THE GENEROUS IRISH


TRENCHWORK AFTER NEUVE CHAPELLE

THANKS TO NEUVE CHAPELLE A BREATHINGSPACE HAD BEEN WON DURING
WHICH TERRITORIAL TROOPS WERE TAKING THEIR PLACE IN THE FRONT LINE
AND SUCH SUPPLIES AS TIMES AFFORDED WERE COMING UP THE DIARY
RECORDS MANY VISITS OF COLONELS BRIGADIERS AND INSPECTORS OF THE
TERRITORIAL FORCES TO THIS SECTION WHICH WHEN IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT
UP TO THE GUARDS STANDARD WAS CONSIDERED A MODEL FOR INSTRUCTION
THE MONTH CLOSED WITH BRIGHT MOONLIGHT AND THE MOUNTING OF TWO MOTOR
MACHINEGUNS ONE SOUTH OF DUCKS BILL AND THE OTHER IN OXFORD
STREET FOR PROTECTION AGAINST AEROPLANES

APRIL OPENED WITH THE DEATH OF 2ND LIEUTENANT J M STEWART KILLED
BEFORE DAWN WHILE LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET OF THE TRENCH AT DUCKS
BILL AND BURIED AT NOON IN THE CEMETERY NEAR WINDY CORNER HE WAS
ONE OF THE BEST OF THE YOUNGER OFFICERS OF THESE DAYS AND HAD PROVED
HIMSELF ON MANY OCCASIONS THE LULL AFTER NEUVE CHAPELLE CONTINUED
THE BATTALION RELIEVING THE GRENADIERS EVERY OTHER DAY AT 6 P M
WITH ALMOST THE REGULARITY OF A CIVILIAN DEPARTMENT WHEN IT WAS
FINE AEROPLANES TAKING NO NOTICE OF THE ANTIAIRCRAFT ARTILLERY
RANGED OVER THEM IN SEARCH OF CERTAIN HEAVY NAVAL GUNS THAT HAD BEEN
REACHING INTO ENEMY BACKAREAS

THERE WAS VERY LITTLE BOMBDROPPING ON INFANTRY AND THE MONOTONY
OF RIFLEFIRE AND OCCASIONAL HANDBOMBING WAS ONLY BROKEN WHEN
OUR ARTILLERY WITH A FEW SHELLS TO SPARE FIRED INTO THE ENEMYS
SECOND LINE NEAR COUTELEUX WHERE THE GERMANS BEHIND HEAVY WIRE
WERE SINGING AND MAKING MUCH NOISE THE EFFORT DREW A RETURN FIRE
OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES AND A SHELL WOUNDED 8 AND KILLED 1 MAN OF NO 3
COMPANY OUR GUNNERS SAID THAT THEY HAD KILLED MANY MORE THAN NINE
GERMANS BUT SPORADIC OUTBURSTS OF THIS KIND WERE NOT WELL SEEN IN
THE FRONT LINE WHICH HAS TO ABIDE THE RESULT AS ONE OFFICER WROTE
I AM ALL FOR DETERMINED BOMBARDMENT BUT DO NOT APPRECIATE MINOR
ONES THOUGH I QUITE SEE IT MAKES THE ENEMY USE HIS AMMUNITION THE
2ND LONDON TERRITORIAL ARTILLERY REGISTERED THEIR GUNS ALSO FOR THE
FIRST TIME ON APRIL 12 AND A PLATOON OF THE 15TH COUNTY OF LONDON
WITH ITS MACHINEGUN WAS ATTACHED TO THE BATTALION FOR INSTRUCTION

IT IS NO SORT OF DISCREDIT TO THE TERRITORIALS THAT AT FIRST THEY DID
NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS WAR AND READING BETWEEN THE LINES
ONE SEES HOW THOROUGHLY AND PATIENTLY THE REGULARS PERFORMED THEIR
EXTRA DUTIES OF SCHOOLMASTERS GUIDES PHILOSOPHERS AND FRIENDS
TO BATTALIONS WHOSE MOST EXTENDED TRAINING HAD NEVER DREAMED OF AN
ORDERED EXISTENCE HALF UNDERGROUND WHERE ALL THINGS BUT DEATH WERE
INVISIBLE AND EVEN THE TRANSPORT AND TENDANCE OF THE WOUNDED WAS A
MYSTERY OF PAIN AND CONFUSION WORKED OUT AMONG LABYRINTHS OF OPEN
DRAINS

AMONG THE DISTINGUISHED VISITORS TO BE SHOWN THE TRENCHES WAS
LIEUTCOLONEL R S DE HAVILAND OF THE ETON OTCA MAN OF MANY
FRIENDS IN THAT COMPANY THE COMEANDGO OF VISITORS CHEERED AND
INTERESTED THE MEN IN THE FRONT TRENCHES SINCE THEIR PRESENCE EVEN
FOR A LITTLE PROVED THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD LIFE CONTINUED ON
NOT INCONCEIVABLE LINES THEY JESTED NATURALLY ENOUGH AT THOSE WHO
LOOKED ON FOR A DAY OR TWO AT THEIR HARDSHIPS AND WENT AWAY BUT
THE HARDSHIPS WERE LIGHTENED A LITTLE BY THE VERY JEST EVEN WHILE
THE COMMANDANT OF THE ETON OTC WAS WITH THEM THE BATTALION WAS
ENERGETICALLY DEVISING MEANS TO DRAIN OUT AN UNSPEAKABLE ACCUMULATION
OF STAGNANT WATER DOWN HILL FROM A MINE NEAR THE SHRINE UNDER THE
WHITE HOUSE BARRICADE THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN A NAME
EVEN THEN INTO SOME GERMAN TRENCHES AT THE FOOT OF THE SLOPE THIS
WORK NECESSITATED CLEARING A DITCH BY THE ROADSIDE IN WHICH WERE
FOUND FOUR GERMAN CORPSES BESIDES PIECES OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
WHICH WERE BURIED AND IN DUE COURSE THE WHOLE FLOOD OF ABOMINATION
WAS DECANTED ON THE ENEMY AS IT WAS VERY HORRIBLE I DONT SUPPOSE
THEY WILL LIKE IT WRITES ONE OF THE OFFICERS CHIEFLY CONCERNED

ON THE SAME DAY APRIL 16 WHILE 2ND LIEUTENANT H MARIONCRAWFORD
WHO IT WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS BRIGADE BOMBING INSTRUCTOR WAS
SCHOOLING SOME MEN OF THE 3RD COLDSTREAM WITH LIVE GRENADES ONE
EXPLODED AND KILLED HIM INSTANTANEOUSLY HE HAD SHOWN THE GREATEST
ABILITY IN ORGANIZING THE BOMBING WORK AND HIS LOSS AT THAT TIME
WHERE BOMBERS WERE BEING MORE AND MORE LEANED UPON WAS VERY
SERIOUSLY FELT HE WAS BURIED FOUR HOURS AFTER HIS DEATH IN THE
CEMETERY NEAR GIVENCHY

ON THE 17TH THE BATTALION WENT BACK TO THE COLLGE DES JEUNES FILLES
AT BTHUNE FOR A FOUR DAYS REST WHILE ITS PLACE IN THE TRENCHES
WAS TAKEN BY A COUPLE OF TERRITORIAL BATTALIONSTHE POST OFFICE
RIFLES AND THE 15TH COUNTY OF LONDON WHILE IT WAS ROUTEMARCHED
AND INSTRUCTED AND WASHED AND STEADILY DRILLED THE BATTLE FOR HILL
60 WAS BEING FOUGHT WITH MINES AND HANDGRENADES HANDMORTARS
AND THE FIRST GASSHELLS A SCORE OF MILES TO THE NORTH WHERE IT
WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE GERMANS HOW MAN FOR MAN THEIR FRESH AND
FULLYTRAINED TROOPS COULD NOT OVERCOME OURS THE DEMONSTRATION COST
SOME THREE THOUSAND CASUALTIES ON OUR SIDE AND IT MAY BE PRESUMED
STRENGTHENED THE ENEMYS INTENTION TO USE GAS ON A LARGER SCALE IN
THE FUTURE BUT NO ECHO OF THE LITTLE AFFAIR INTERFERED WITH THE WORK
AT GIVENCHY THE QUESTION WAS HOW THE NEW TERRITORIAL BATTALIONS
WOULD HOLD THEIR TRENCHES AND ONE SEES IN ALL THE DOCUMENTS A
JUSTIFIED PRIDE IN THEIR TEACHINGS WHEN THE BATTALION WENT UP TO THE
FRONT AGAIN ON THE 22ND AND FOUND THE TERRITORIALS WERE KEEN AND HAD
KEPT THEIR TRENCHES CLEAN FOR THE GUARDS TEACH NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY
THAT UNLESS A MAN IS CLEAN HE CANNOT BE THE BEST SORT OF SOLDIER

ON THE NIGHT OF THE 22ND APRIL THE SECTOR WAS HELD BY THE 15TH
COUNTY OF LONDON THE IRISH GUARDS AND THE POST OFFICE RIFLES THE
REMAINDER OF THE GUARDS BRIGADE BEING IN REST TO THE NORMAL STRAIN
OF A WATCHING FRONT LINE IN FOUL WEATHER WAS ADDED A FRESH BURDEN A
FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ENEMY HAD BLOWN A MINE IN AN ORCHARD ABOUT FIFTY
YARDS SHORT OF OUR TRENCHES IT DID NO DAMAGE AT THE TIME BUT THE
RE MINING OFFICER LIEUTENANT BARCLAY IN COUNTERMINING TOWARDS
THE CRATER IT HAD MADE SAW THROUGH THE WALL OF HIS MINE GERMANS
ENGAGED IN TURNING THE CRATER INTO AN ADVANCEDPOST TRENCHMORTARS
WERE FIRED AT ONCE TO DISCOURAGE THEM THEN CAME REPORTS OF
UNDERGROUND WORKINGS HEARD IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AND NOTABLY CLOSE
TO THE PARAPET OF A TRENCH NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WAS ON THE
EVENING OF THE 24TH HARDLY HAD ORDERS BEEN GIVEN TO CLEAR THE WHITE
HOUSE TRENCH WHEN THE GROUND AT THE JUNCTION OF LIEUTENANT BARCLAYS
COUNTERMINE AND THE GERMAN CRATER WENT UP AND THE LIEUTENANT WAS
KILLED AT THE SAME TIME AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE
TWO PRIVATES OF THE IRISH GUARDS 2845 J MANSFIELD AND 3975 M
BRINE VOLUNTEERED TO ENTER OUR MINE AND SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THEY RECOVERED LIEUTENANT BARCLAYS BODY AT GREAT RISK FROM THE
ASPHYXIATING GASES AND BOTH MEN WERE RECOMMENDED FOR THE DCM THE
EXPLOSION NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE WAS AFTER INSPECTION PUT DOWN AS THE
WORK OF A HEAVY SHELL NOT A MINE BUT LISTENING PARTIES REPORTED
MORE UNDERGROUND NOISES AND ANOTHER SECTION OF TRENCH WAS EVACUATED
ACCORDINGLY TO PREVENT THE GERMANS CONSOLIDATING THEMSELVES FURTHER
IN THE CRATER WHICH CONNECTED WITH LIEUTENANT BARCLAYS MINE OUR
45 HOWITZERS BOMBARDED IT ON THE 25TH AND IT WAS DECIDED TO
BLOW OUR END OF THE MINE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THE ENEMY
WORKING UP IT THIS WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE GALLERIES WERE FULL OF
FOUL GASWHETHER LEAKING FROM SOME ADJACENT COALPIT OR LAID ON BY
THE ENEMY WAS UNCERTAIN THE RE OFFICER WHO WENT DOWN TO LAY THE
CHARGES WAS ASPHYXIATED AND SEVERAL OF HIS MEN WERE INJURED

NOT TILL THE 29TH OF APRIL WERE THE DIFFICULTIES OVERCOME BY WHICH
TIME THE ENEMY HAD DRIVEN A FRESH SHAFT INTO IT AFTER THE EXPLOSION
A FIELDBATTERY 17TH RFA AND THE 47TH HOWITZER BATTERY FIRED A
SALVO AT THE GERMAN TRENCHES THERE WAS A LITTLE RIFLEFIRE BUT
SOON ALL WAS QUIET MINING LIKE AERIAL AND BOMBING WORK WAS STILL
IN ITS INFANCY AND THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE INTELLIGENCE WAS
SAID TO BE BELATED AND INADEQUATE

AN INTERESTING POINT IS THE UNSHAKEN SERENITY WITH WHICH THE MEN
TOOK THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS THEY WERE FAR TOO ANNOYED AT BEING
SHIFTED ABOUT AND LOSING THEIR REST TO CONSIDER TOO CURIOUSLY THE
UNDERLYING CAUSES OF EVIL THEY LEFT THE 3RD COLDSTREAM TO DEAL WITH
THE SITUATION AND WENT INTO BILLETS IN LE PROL AND THE NEXT DAY
APRIL 26 INTO BTHUNE FOR THEIR HOT BATHS A DRAFT OF 3 OFFICERS
CAPTAIN T M D BAILIE AND 2ND LIEUTENANTS A W L PAGET AND R
S G PAGET WITH 136 NCOS AND MEN REACHED THEM ON THE 27TH
WHEN THERE WAS JUST TIME TO GIVE THEM A HOT MEAL AND SEND THEM AT
ONCE TO THE TRENCHES IN THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF RIFLEFIRE AND INTERMITTENT SHELLING FROM SMALL GUNS WHICH DID
NOT DO MUCH DAMAGE AN ENEMY FIELDGUN LONG KNOWN AS AN UNLOCATED
PEST SPENT THE MORNING BUSILY ENFILADING THE TRENCHES IN SPITE OF
THE ASSURANCES OF OUR ARTILLERY THAT THEY HAD FOUND AND KNOCKED IT
OUT SEVERAL TIMES APPEAL WAS MADE TO AN RA BRIGADIER WHO AFTER
EXAMINING THE GROUND LEFT THE BATTALION UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT
IT WAS LIKELY A GUN WOULD BE BROUGHT UP EARLY TOMORROW NOTHING
MORE IS HEARD OF THE HOPE BUT GUNS WERE SCARCE AT THAT TIME

THERE WERE OTHER PREOCCUPATIONS FOR THOSE IN COMMAND THE SECOND
BATTLE OF YPRES THAT MONTHS MIRACLE OF NAKED ENDURANCE AGAINST THE
LONGPLANNED AND COLDLY THOUGHTOUT HORROR OF GAS HAD BEGUN NEAR
LANGEMARCK WITH THE CHOKINGOUT OF THE FRENCH AND CANADIAN TROOPS
AND HAD CONTINUED DAY AFTER DAY WITH THE SACRIFICE OF BATTALIONS
AND BRIGADES REGULARS AND TERRITORIALS SWALLOWED UP IN THE LOW
GREYYELLOW GAS BANKS THAT THREATENED YPRES FROM LANGEMARCK TO HILL
60 OR BEATEN TO PULP BY HEAVY EXPLOSIVES AND THE REMNANT RIDDLED
ANEW BY MACHINEGUNS ONCE AGAIN ENGLAND WAS MAKING GOOD WITH HER
BEST FLESH AND BLOOD FOR THE MATERIAL AND THE TRAINING SHE HAD
DELIBERATELY REFUSED TO PROVIDE WHILE YET PEACE HELD THE MEN WHO
CAME OUT OF THAT FURNACE ALIVE SAY THAT NO AFTER EXPERIENCE OF ALL
THE WAR APPROACHED IT FOR SHEER CONCENTRATED AS WELL AS PROLONGED
TERROR CONFUSION AND A GROWING SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS AMONG GROWING
AGONIES IF A WORLD AT THAT TIME UNBROKEN TO GERMAN METHODS STOOD
AGHAST AT THE LIMITED REVELATIONS ALLOWED BY THE PRESS CENSORSHIP
REPORTS THOSE WHO HAD SEEN A MAN OR WORSE A CHILD DYING FROM
GAS MAY CONCEIVE WITH WHAT EMOTIONS MEN EXPOSED TO THE NEW TORMENT
REGARDED IT WHAT KIND OF REPORTS LEAKED OUT FROM CLEARINGSTATIONS
AND HOSPITALS AND WHAT WORK THEREFORE WAS LAID UPON OFFICERS TO
MAINTAIN AN EVEN AND UNAFFECTED TEMPER IN THE BATTALIONS IN WAITING
THE RECORDS OF COURSE DO NOT MENTION THESE DETAILS NOR INDEED
DO THEY RECORD WHEN GASPROTECTORS FOR MASKS HELMETS AND BOXES
WERE NOT EVOLVED TILL MUCH LATER WERE FIRST ISSUED TO THE TROOPS ON
THE GIVENCHY SECTOR BUT PRIVATE LETTERS OF THE 25TH APRIL AT THE
TIME THE GERMAN MINE IN THE ORCHARD OCCUPIED THEIR ATTENTION REMARK
WE HAVE ALL BEEN ISSUED OUT WITH AN ANTIDOTE TO THE LATEST GERMAN
VILLAINY  IE OF ASPHYXIATING GASES WHAT THEY WILL END BY
DOING ONE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THE ONLY THING IS TO BE PREPARED FOR
ANYTHING

THE FIRST MASKS WERE LITTLE MORE THAN MUFFLERS OR STRIPS OF CLOTH
DIPPED IN LIME WATER A WEATHERCOCK WAS RIGGED UP NEAR HEADQUARTERS
DUGOUTS AND WHEN THE WIND BLEW FROM THE GERMANS THESE WERE GOT
READY FALSE ALARMS OF GAS DUE TO STRANGE STENCHES GIVEN OFF BY
VARIOUS EXPLOSIVES OR THE APPEARANCE OF A MIST OVER THE GERMAN
LINE WERE NOT UNCOMMON AND ON EACH OCCASION IT APPEARED THAT
THE CO HAD TO TURN OUT SNIFF AND PERSONALLY PASS JUDGMENT ON
THE CASE THE MEN HAD THEIR INSTRUCTIONS WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF
EMERGENCY CONCLUDING WITH THE SIMPLE ORDER PERHAPS THE RESULT OF
EXPERIENCE AT YPRES IN EVENT OF THE FIRST LINE BEING OVERCOME THE
SECOND IMMEDIATELY CHARGE THROUGH THE GAS AND OCCUPY THE FRONTLINE
TRENCHES

BUT TO RETURN TO THE ROUTINE

THE CASUALTIES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL WERE 2 OFFICERS AND 8 MEN
KILLED AND 1 OFFICER AND 42 MEN WOUNDED THE STRENGTH OF THE
BATTALION STOOD AT 28 OFFICERS AND 1133 MEN HIGHER THAN IT HAD EVER
BEEN BEFORE

OFFICERS LIEUTENANT H A BOYSE AND 2ND LIEUTENANT R H W HEARD
JOINED ON THE 2ND


THE BATTLE OF FESTUBERT

IT WAS JUDGED EXPEDIENT WHILE THE SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES WAS IN FULL
HEAT THAT THE GERMANS SHOULD IF POSSIBLE BE KEPT FROM SENDING ANY
HELP TO THEIR FRONT NEAR ARRAS IN ARTOIS WHICH AT THE TIME WAS
UNDER STRONG PRESSURE FROM THE FRENCH THRUSTING TOWARDS LENS TO THIS
END OUR FIRST ARMY WAS ORDERED TO ATTACK THE GERMAN SEVENTH CORPS
OVER THE FLAT GROUND BETWEEN LAVENTIE AND RICHEBOURG ON A FRONT OF
SOME TEN MILES THE AFFAIR OPENED VERY EARLY ON THE MORNING OF THE
9TH MAY WITH A BOMBARDMENT IMPOSING IN ITSELF BY THE STANDARDS OF
THE DAY BUT AS BEFORE INSUFFICIENT TO BREAK THE WIRE OR CRUSH
ENOUGH OF THE MACHINEGUN NESTS THE GERMANS SEEM TO HAVE HAD FULL
INFORMATION OF ITS COMING AND DEALT WITH IT SEVERELY THE WHOLE
ATTACK FROM NORTH TO SOUTHINDIAN SCOTTISH TERRITORIALS AND THE
RESTWAS CAUGHT AND BROKEN AS IT ROLLED AGAINST THE WELLWIRED
GERMAN TRENCHES

THE BATTALION WHOSE PART THEN WAS TO MAINTAIN THE RIGHT OF OUR
ARMY WHERE IT JOINED THE FRENCH HEARD THE FRENCH GUNS OPEN ON THE
NIGHT OF THE 8TH MAY AND BY DAWN THE ENGLISH GUNFIRE WAS IN FULL
SWING TO THE NORTHONE CONTINUOUS ROAR BROKEN BY THE DEEP GRUNT OF
OUR HOWITZERSHELLS BURSTING FOR THESE WERE SO FEW THAT WE COULD
PICK THEM UP BY EAR THE GUARDS HAD NO CONCERN WITH THESE MATTERS
TILL THE TROUBLE SHOULD THICKEN THEIR BUSINESS WAS TO STAND READY
FOR ANY COUNTERATTACK AND KEEP UP BURSTS OF RAPID FIRE AT INTERVALS
WHILE THEY WAITED FOR WHAT LITTLE NEWS CAME TO HAND IT WAS UNIFORMLY
BAD EXCEPT THAT THE FRENCH IN THE SOUTH SEEMED TO BE MAKING SOME
HEADWAY AND SO FAR AS AEROPLANES AND ARTILLERY OBSERVERS COULD MAKE
OUT THERE WAS NO CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF
THEM THE GERMANS WERE TOO BUSY WITH THE IMMEDIATE ENGLISH FRONT
TO EXTEND THEIR COMMITMENTS TO THE SOUTHWARD AND THE NEXT TWO DAYS
WERE FOR THE BATTALION IN THEIR TRENCHES THE QUIETEST THAT THEY HAD
KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THEN CAME ORDERS TO HAND OVER TO THE 1ST SCOTS
GUARDS AND REJOIN THE SECOND DIVISION NEAR LE TOURET IN READINESS
TO CARRY ON THE ATTACK WHICH HAD BROKEN DOWN ON THE 9TH THEY
BIVOUACKED IN THE OPEN AND THE WEATHER TURNED COLD AND WET BUT THE
MEN RELIEVED FROM THE TRENCHES AND ASSURED OF A CHANGE OF WORK SAT
IT OUT SINGING SONGS AND PLAYING GAMES IN THE WET THEY HAD BEEN
FORBIDDEN TO LIGHT FIRES LEST THEY SHOULD ACCIDENTALLY USE THE LOCAL
FARMERS TOBACCODRYING POLES OR HEDGESTUFF AND WHILE THEY WAITED
UNDER THEIR MACKINTOSH SHEETS THE ARMIES WAITED ON THE WEATHER A
FRESH ATTACK WAS TO BE LAUNCHED FROM RICHEBOURG BY THE RUE DU BOIS
AND SOUTHWARD AS FAR AS FESTUBERT BUT THIS TIME BY NIGHT NOT BY
DAY AND AFTER LONGER ARTILLERY PREPARATION THE 5TH AND 6TH BRIGADES
WERE TO OPEN IT WITH THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE IN SUPPORT IT BEGAN
AT 1130 ON THE 15TH WHEN AT HUGE COST SOMETHING LIKE HALF A MILE
IN BREADTH AND A QUARTER OF A MILE IN DEPTH OF TRENCHES WAS SCREWED
OUT OF THE GERMANS BY THE MORNING OF SUNDAY THE 16TH THE BATTALION
WAS MOVED FROM BIVOUAC IN THE DAWN OF THAT DAY TO SUPPORT THE 5TH
BRIGADE WHICH HAD NOT GONE SO FAR FORWARD AS THE 6TH AND SPENT
THE DAY IN TRENCHES AT RUE DU BOIS UNDER INCESSANT MIXED ARTILLERY
FIRE WHICH KILLED 1 MAN AND WOUNDED AN OFFICER AND 28 MENTHE
WHOLE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO INFLICT ANY DAMAGE ON THE ENEMY INDEED
THE SURVIVORS OF THE BATTLE HERE AGREED THAT THEY SAW NO GERMAN
DEAD OTHER THAN SOME CORPSES LEFT OVER FROM PREVIOUS ATTACKS THEY
RETURNED TO BIVOUAC IN WET AND MIST AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 17TH
WERE WITH THE 2ND GRENADIERS ORDERED TO OCCUPY THE LINE THEN HELD
BY THE 21ST BRIGADE AND TO PUSH FORWARD AND DIG IN NEAR A FARM COUR
LAVOINE BRISTLING WITH MACHINEGUNS ACROSS A STRETCH OF DEAD FLAT
MUDDY GROUND PITTED WITH WATERLOGGED SHELLHOLES THE LEFT WAS TO
KEEP TOUCH WITH THE 6TH BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT WITH THE GRENADIERS
THE WHOLE LINE FACING NORTHEAST FROM QUINQUE RUE

THEY EXTENDED IN THE DUSK THE LEFT FLANKING COMPANY NO 4 FOUND NO
SIGN OF THE 6TH BRIGADE BUT RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE 5TH KINGS
BATTALION THAT THEIR BRIGADE ORDERS WERE THAT THE RIGHT OF THAT
BATTALION SHOULD GET INTO TOUCH WITH THE IRISH BUT WOULD NOT BE UP
TILL LATE SO ONE MACHINEGUN WAS SENT TO STRENGTHEN THAT COMPANYS
FLANK NO 2 COMPANY ON THE RIGHT FLANK HAD REACHED ITS OBJECTIVE
AND DUG ITSELF IN UNDER BURSTS OF RAKING MACHINEGUN AND RIFLEFIRE
DIRECTED AGAINST THE DYKES AND BRIDGES WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WOUNDED
BOTH CAPTAIN MYLNE AND LIEUTENANT KEMP AND THE COMPANY COMMAND
DEVOLVED ON 2ND LIEUTENANT S G TALLENTS THE LEFT FLANK MEANTIME
WAS IN THE AIR WITHOUT TOOLS OR SANDBAGS BUT LUCKILY THE NIGHT WAS
WET AND IT WAS ALLOWED TO DIG ITSELF IN UNMOLESTED THE CASUALTIES
FOR THE DAY WERE ONLY 2 OFFICERS WOUNDED 3 MEN KILLED AND 5 WOUNDED

THE 18TH DAWNED IN WREATHS OF DRIVING RAIN AND MIST THAT WRAPPED
THE FLATS THE PRELIMINARY BOMBARDMENT OF FARM COUR LAVOINE WAS
POSTPONED FOR LACK OF GOOD LIGHT AND IN THAT LULL A BRIGADIER
WHOSE MEN HAD ALREADY ATTACKED THE FARM UNSUCCESSFULLY CAME
ACROSS THE TRENCHES TO THE BATTALION AND GAVE HIS EXPERIENCES AND
RECOMMENDATIONS THE WEATHER MADE ONE LOW CLUSTER OF DEVASTATED
BUILDINGS SEEN ACROSS THE LEVELS LOOK REMARKABLY LIKE ANY OTHER AND
IT SEEMS PURE LUCK THAT THE ATTACK AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED WAS NOT
LAUNCHED AGAINST THE WRONG OBJECTIVE FROM NOON ON THE ENEMY BEGAN
TO SHELL THE BATTALION SEVERELY IN ITS SHALLOW TRENCHES AND THERE
WERE FORTY CASUALTIES WHILE THEY LAY AWAITING ORDERS THE ATTACK
BEGAN AT 430 P M COUR LAVOINE WAS THEN SO BOMBARDED BY HEAVY
SHELLFIRE THAT AS USUAL IT SEEMED THAT NOTHING IN OR AROUND IT
COULD LIVE BUT AS SOON AS THE ATTACKING COMPANIES ROSE AND SHOWED
OVER THE GROUNDLINE THE HAIL OF MACHINEGUN FIRE REOPENED AND
FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS THE IRISH SUFFERED IN THE OPEN AND AMONG
THE SHELLHOLES BEATEN DOWN AS THE OTHER BATTALIONS HAD BEEN
BEFORE THEM ROUND THE PILED WRECKAGE OF COUR LAVOINE FARM IN ONE
TRENCH ABANDONED BY THE ENEMY THEY FELL INTO A NEAT GERMAN TRAP
ITS PARAPET FACING TOWARDS THE BRITISH WAS BULLETPROOF ENOUGH
BUT THE PARADOS THOUGH PROOF AGAINST THE CASUAL SPLINTERS OF OUR
SHRAPNEL WHICH HAD NO BACKBLAST HAD BEEN PARED THIN ENOUGH TO
PASS ALL BULLETS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THE TRENCH WAS OCCUPIED
ACCURATELY RANGED MACHINEGUNS OPENED ON THE PARADOS AND RIDDLED
THE MEN TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT ONE COMPANY HAD TO GET OUT AND TAKE
REFUGE BEHIND WHAT HAD BEEN THE PARAPET THE GREATEST DISTANCE GAINED
IN ALL WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YARDS AND THIS WITH THEIR LEFT
FLANK STILL IN THE AIR AND PROTECTED BY THE ONE MACHINEGUN WHICH
LIEUTENANT STRAKER THE UNFLINCHING ENTHUSIAST OF THE WEAPON HAD
BROUGHT INTO A COMMUNICATIONTRENCH AT LAST THEY DUG IN WHERE THEY
WERE THE NEXT BRIGADE ON THE LEFT LINKED UP TO THE ONE MACHINEGUN
COMMUNICATIONTRENCH AND WITH THEIR OLD FRIENDS THE HERTS BATTALION
AND THE EAST ANGLIAN FIELD COMPANY WITH WHOM THEY HAD TESTED MINES
TOGETHER THEY BEGAN TO CONSOLIDATE THE CO WRITES I TRIED TO
FIND OUT WHAT OFFICERS I HAD LEFT OUT OF TWENTYEIGHT THERE WERE
TWELVE BUT FOUR OF THESE HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND WITH THE TRANSPORT A
DAY OR TWO BEFORE OF THE EIGHT WHO HAD COME THROUGH THE AFFAIR ON
THEIR FEET ONLY TWO WERE ABSOLUTELY UNTOUCHED HERE IS THE LIST
CAPTAIN J N GUTHRIE AND 2ND LIEUTENANT V W D FOX KILLED BY
SHELLFIRE WHILE LEADING THEIR COMPANYNO 1TO REINFORCE THE
LINE 11 OFFICERS WERE WOUNDED MAJOR THE EARL OF ROSSE VERY SEVERELY

LONG RANGE BUT EQUABLE IN TEMPER AND MORALE

SMALL WONDER THAT IN THE CHEERLESS DAWN OF THE 19TH THEIR BRIGADIER
CAME AND MADE SOME COMPLIMENTARY REMARKS TO THE MEN WHO WERE
STANDING ABOUT

THE FOUR OFFICERS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND WERE THEN ORDERED UP TO
FILL THE GAPS AND IN THAT DAWN THE COMPANY COMMANDS STOOD NO 1

ALMOST AT ONCE SHELLING OPENED AGAIN AND LIEUTENANTS BURKE AND PAGET
WERE WOUNDED AND 10 MEN KILLED OR WOUNDED BY THREE HIGH EXPLOSIVES
BURSTING RIGHT OVER THE LINE IT WAS SHEER LUCK THAT THOUGH
SHELLED AT INTERVALS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY THERE WERE VERY FEW
FURTHER CASUALTIES AND THE BATTALION RETURNED IN SMALL PARTIES
TO THEIR BIVOUACS NEAR LE TOURET WHERE A HOT MEAL GREATCOATS AND
A RUMRATION AWAITED THEM THEY WERE WET TIRED CHILLED AND CAKED
WITH DIRT AND CHEERFUL BUT NEXT DAY WHEN THEY PARADED BEFORE GOING
INTO REST WHILE THEY WAITED FOR REINFORCEMENTS THERE WAS HARDLY A
SPECK OF MUD TO BE SEEN ON THEM RESTBILLETS AT LAPUGNOY SOME SEVEN
OR EIGHT MILES BACK WERE OUT OF RANGE BUT NOT OUT OF HEARING OF
THE GUNS IN A VALLEY BETWEEN DELIGHTFUL BEECHWOODS CARPETED WITH
BLUEBELLS HERE THEY LAY OFF AND REJOICED IN THE NOVEL SIGHT OF
UNSCATHED TREES AND ACTUAL HILLS


FROM FESTUBERT TO LOOS

ON THE 24TH MAY GENERAL HORNE CAME TO INSPECT AND COMPLIMENTED THEM
HIS COMPLIMENTS ARE NOWHERE RECORDED BUT IT WAS REMARKED WITH
SATISFACTION AT HIS PARADE THAT THE MEN STOOD VERY STEADY AND MOVED
THEIR ARMS WELL CONSIDERING THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD MUCH PRACTICE IN
STEADY DRILL LATELY THEY HAD MERELY PRACTISED UNBROKEN DISCIPLINE
AMONG THE DEAD AND THE DYING IN A HOPELESS FIGHT

A DRAFT OF 126 MEN UNDER LIEUTENANT A F GORDON ARRIVED AND
LIEUTENANT R RANKIN WHO HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS
SINCE FEBRUARY JOINED THEM AT LAPUGNOY AND THE REV S KNAPP RC
CHAPLAIN FROM THE 25TH BRIGADE TOOK TEMPORARY CHARGE OF SPIRITUAL
AFFAIRS WHILE THEIR OWN FATHER GWYNNE WHO NEVER SPARED HIMSELF WAS
TRYING ELECTRIC TREATMENT IN PARIS FOR LUMBAGO INDUCED AS EVERY ONE
KNEW BY UNSPARING EXPOSURE

ON THE 25TH MAY THEY MOVED FROM LAPUGNOY VIA CHOCQUES TO OBLINGHEM
SOME FIVE MILES TO THE NORTHEAST A VILLAGE OF MANY AND VARIED
SMELLS CLOSE TO AN AERODROME WHERE THEY LAY AT A MOMENTS NOTICE
WHICH MEANT THAT NO ONE COULD TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS A NEW TYPE OF
GASMASK WAS ISSUED HERE AND THE MEN DRILLED IN THE USE OF IT
CAPTAIN A H L MCCARTHY THE MEDICAL OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN WITH THEM
SINCE OCTOBER 25 ACCIDENTALLY BROKE HIS ARM AND HIS DUTIES WERE
TAKEN OVER BY LIEUTENANT L W BAIN RAMC

ON THE 28TH MAY A DRAFT OF 214 NCOS AND MEN UNDER LIEUTENANT L

THERE IS NO HINT OF THE DESPERATE HARD WORK OF THE 2ND RESERVE
BATTALION AT WARLEY WHICH MADE POSSIBLE THE SUPPLY AT SUCH SHORT
NOTICE OF SO MANY OFFICERS OF SUCH QUALITY THESE INNER WORKINGS OF
A REGIMENT ARE KNOWN ONLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE BORNE THE BURDEN

ON THE 31ST MAY THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE WAS SHIFTED FROM OBLINGHEM
TO BILLETS NEAR THE MOST UNPLEASING VILLAGE OF NUXLESMINES
FARTHER SOUTH THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AS DIVISIONAL RESERVE
TO A COUPLE OF BRIGADES OF THE 2ND DIVISION IN TRENCHES RECENTLY
TAKEN OVER FROM THE FRENCH THE BRIGADE MOVED OFF IN TWO COLUMNS
THROUGH BTHUNE DOWN THE MAIN ROAD TO ARRAS WHERE THEY WERE SEEN BY
THE GERMANS AND SHELLED BOTH EN ROUTE AND AS THEY WERE BILLETING
BUT AS CHANCE CHOSE WITHOUT ACCIDENT THE BILLETS WERE GOOD
THOUGH LIKE MOST IN THE EARLY DAYS THEY NEEDED CLEANSING AND
A RUMOUR WENT ABOUT THAT THE TRENCHES TO WHICH THE BATTALION WAS
ASSIGNED WERE PECULIARLY FOUL IN VERY BAD SHAPE AND WOULD PROBABLY
NEED REMAKING THROUGHOUT

BOMBING CLASSES WITH A NEW AND AN ABSOLUTELY SAFE BOMB MILLS
THE ROUTINE OF COMPANY DRILLS AND EXERCISE SPORTS AND AN ETON
DINNER ON THE 4TH JUNE FILLED THE WARM PEACEFUL DAYS TILL IT LEFT
NUXLESMINES FOR SAILLYLABOURSE THIS WAS NOT THE SECTOR THEY HAD
EXPECTED BUT ONE FARTHER TO THE NORTH AND NEARER CUINCHY THEIR
TRENCHES WERE AN UNSATISFACTORY LINE WITH INSUFFICIENT TRAVERSES
NOT TOO MANY DUGOUTS AND INADEQUATE PARAPETS FACING FIELDS OF
FASTGROWING CORN WHICH MARKED THE GERMAN FRONT TWO HUNDRED YARDS
AWAY THEY WERE REACHED FROM CAMBRIN THROUGH A MILE AND A HALF OF
COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES UP WHICH EVERY DROP OF WATER HAD TO BE
CARRIED IN TINS A RECENT DRAFT OF FIFTY HAD INCREASED THE BATTALION
TO OVER A THOUSAND MEN AND APPARENTLY BY WAY OF BREAKING IN THE
NEW HANDS IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE BATTALION SHOULD DIG A COMPLETE
NEW LINE OF TRENCHES THEY COMPROMISED HOWEVER BY IMPROVING THE
EXISTING ONE WHICH THEY SHARED WITH THE 2ND GRENADIERS CHANGING
OVER ON THE 12TH JUNE TO A STRETCH OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED YARDS HELD BY
THE 2ND COLDSTREAM THIS NECESSITATED THREE COMPANIES INSTEAD OF TWO
IN THE FRONT LINE AND THE FOURTH IN SUPPORT

THE ENEMY HERE CONFINED THEMSELVES TO SHELLING TIMED TO CATCH
RELIEFS BUT RARELY HEAVY ENOUGH TO INTERFERE WITH WORKINGPARTIES
DIGGING OR WIRING IN THE TOUGH CHALK ON ONE OCCASION A SELECTION
OF COLOURED LIGHTS RED GREEN AND WHITE HAD BEEN SENT UP FOR
THE BATTALIONS TO TEST THEY CHOSE A NIGHT WHEN THE ENEMY WAS
EXPERIMENTING ON A COLLECTION OF LIGHTS OF HIS OWN BUT SOON
DISCOVERED THAT ROCKETLIGHTS WERE INADVISABLE AS THEIR FIERY TAILS
GAVE AWAY POSITIONS AND DREW FIRE THIS DISADVANTAGE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN FOUND OUT IN ENGLAND BY THE MAKERS INSTEAD OF AT 1 A M BY A
WEARIED COMMANDING OFFICER WHOSE DUTY WAS TO LINK UP AND STRENGTHEN
HIS TRENCHES KEEP AN EYE ON THE BAFFLING BREADTHS OF CORN IN FRONT
OF HIM SEND RECONNOITRING PARTIES OUT ON ALL POSSIBLE OCCASIONS
PROCURE WIRE AND ENGINEERS TO SET IT UP AND AT THE SAME TIME KEEP
ALL MEN AND MATERIAL IN READINESS FOR ANY POSSIBLE ATTACK THAT MIGHT
DEVELOP ON THE HEELS OF THE BOMBARDMENTS THAT CAME AND WENT LIKE THE
SUMMER THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE TENSE LINE

SOMETIMES THEY WATCHED OUR OWN SHELLS BURSTING IN THE GERMAN TRENCHES
OPPOSITE GIVENCHY WHERE THE BATTALION HAD STAYED SO LONG SOMETIMES
THEY HEARD UNEXPLAINED FRENCH FIRE TO THE SOUTHWARD NEXT DAY WOULD
BRING ITS RUMOURS OF GAINS WON AND LOST OR WARNINGS TO STANDTO
FOR EXPECTED COUNTERATTACKS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NO MORE THAN
THE RUMBLE OF GERMAN TRANSPORT HEARD AT NIGHT MOVING NO ONE KNEW
WHITHER WHEN OUR STINTED ARTILLERY FELT ALONG THE ENEMYS TRENCHES
IN FRONT OF THEMFOR THE HIGH CORN MADE NO MANS LAND BLIND AND
PATROLWORK DIFFICULTTHE GERMAN REPLIES WERE GENERALLY LIBERAL AND
NOT LONG DELAYED

ON THE 17TH JUNE ONE SUCH OUTBURST OF OURS LOOSED AN HOURS HEAVY
SHELLING DURING WHICH STAFFCAPTAIN THE HON E W BRABAZON
COLDSTREAM ON HIS ROUNDS TO LOOK AT A MACHINEGUN POSITION UNDER
THE BATTALION MACHINEGUN OFFICER LIEUTENANT STRAKER WAS KILLED
BY A SHELL THAT FELL ON THE TOP OF THE DUGOUT LIEUTENANT STRAKER
WHO WAS SITTING IN THE DOORWAY HAD HIS FOOT SO PINNED IN THE FALLEN
TIMBER THAT IT TOOK AN HOUR TO EXTRICATE HIM CAPTAIN BRABAZON IN
THE DUGOUT ITSELF WAS CRUSHED BY A BEAM HE WAS BURIED AT CAMBRIN
NEXT MORNING AT NINE OCLOCK WHILE THE BATTALION WAS REPAIRING THE
DAMAGE DONE TO THE BLOWNIN TRENCHES AND THE FRENCH WERE FIGHTING
AGAIN IN THE SOUTH

THE BROTHERLY HERTS BATTALION HAD BEEN DOING ALL THE WORK OF DIGGING
IN THEIR REAR FOR SOME TIME PAST AND ON THE 20TH THE BATTALION
TOOK OVER THEIR FATIGUEWORK AND THEIR BILLETS AT ANNEQUIN AND
CAMBRIN WHILE THE HERTS WENT TO THE FRONT LINE IT WAS HOT WORK IN
THAT WEATHER TO EXTEND AND DEEPEN UNENDING COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES
THAT CUT OFF ALL THE AIR THE PRINCE OF WALES LOOKED IN ON THEM AT
ANNEQUIN AND WATCHED THE GERMAN GUNS SEARCHING FOR A HEAVY BATTERY
WHICH HAD GONE ELSEWHERE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEIR TO THE CROWN
EVEN AS GUARDEDLY RECORDED IN THIS DIARY NOT TO MENTION OTHERS AND
THE UNOFFICIAL STORIES OF HIS APPEARANCE ALONE ON A BICYCLE OR
AFOOT IN PLACES OF THE MOST UNHEALTHY CHARACTER MUST HAVE BEEN A
CAUSE OF CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY TO THOSE IN CHARGE OF HIM HE SPENT
HIS BIRTHDAY JUNE 23 VISITING ALONG THE LINE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE
QUIET AFTER A BOMBARDMENT OF ANNEQUIN THE DAY BEFORE THE PLACE DREW
MUCH FIRE AT THAT TIME AS ONE OF OUR BATTERIES LAY IN FRONT OF IT
AND A HIGH COAL DUMP USED AS AN OBSERVATIONPOST JUST BEHIND IT
THE BATTALION WAS STILL ON FATIGUES AND IN SPITE OF MANY RUMOURS
AND ALERTS HAD SUFFERED VERY LITTLE INDEED THE TOTAL CASUALTIES
OF JUNE WERE BUT 2 MEN KILLED AND AN OFFICER AND 22 MEN WOUNDED
MEANTIME THE NEW DRAFTS WERE LEARNING THEIR WORK

THE REALLY SERIOUS BLOW THEY TOOK WAS THE DEPARTURE AT THE MONTHS
END OF LORD CAVAN THEIR BRIGADIER TO COMMAND THE FIFTIETH
DIVISION THEY HAD KNOWN AND LOVED HIM AS A MAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THEIR
DIFFICULTIES WHO BORE HIS SHARE AND MORE OF THEIR HARDSHIPS AND
WHOSE SYMPATHY UNSPARING DEVOTION AND ABOVE ALL ABOUNDING CHEERY
COMMONSENSE HAD CARRIED THEM AT EVERY TURN SO FAR THROUGH THE
CAMPAIGN

HE BID THEM FAREWELL AT BTHUNE ON THE 28TH WHERE THEY WERE IN
RESTBILLETS IN THESE WORDS

I HAVE COME TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOU AS I HAVE TO GO AWAY AND TAKE
COMMAND OF THE FIFTIETH DIVISION I WISH TO THANK THE IRISH GUARDS
FOR ALL THEY HAVE DONE SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER MY COMMAND
BEFORE THE WAR THEY HAD HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF PROVING THEMSELVES
WORTHY TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE BRIGADE OF GUARDS BUT DURING THE
COURSE OF THIS WAR THEY HAVE ALWAYS CONDUCTED THEMSELVES WORTHY
OF TAKING THEIR PLACE WITH THE OTHER ILLUSTRIOUS REGIMENTS OF THE
BRIGADE OF GUARDSAND MORE SO IT IS PART OF ALL OF YOU YOUNG
OFFICERS WHO HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN TO
KEEP UP THE REPUTATION OF THE BATTALION AND YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT
TASK AS ITS REPUTATION IS VERY HIGH I NEED HARDLY SAY HOW MUCH
I FEEL LEAVING THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE AND I WOULD RATHER REMAIN
ITS BRIGADIER THAN BE A FIELDMARSHAL ELSEWHERE

GENERAL FEILDING WHOM YOU ALL KNOW IS COMING TO TAKE MY PLACE
AND I COULD NOT LEAVE YOU IN BETTER HANDS I WISH YOU ALL LUCK

HIS SPECIAL FAREWELL ORDER RAN

28TH JUNE 1915

ON LEAVING THE BRIGADE TO TAKE COMMAND OF A DIVISION IT WOULD NOT
BE SEEMLY TO RECALL THE VARIOUS ACTIONS SINCE 18TH SEPTEMBER IN
WHICH IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE AND MY DELIGHT TO COMMAND YOU BUT
I MAY SAY THISWHETHER IN ACTION IN TRENCHES OR IN BILLETS NO
UNIT OF THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE HAS EVER DISAPPOINTED ME NOR HAS
ANY BATTALION EVER FALLEN SHORT OF THAT GREAT STANDARD SET US BY
OUR PREDECESSORS

WE WELCOMED THE 1ST HERTS TERRITORIALS AT YPRES AND MOST WORTHILY
HAVE THEY BORNE THEIR PART WITH THE REST OF US

TO YOU ALL I CONVEY THE GRATITUDE OF A VERY FULL HEART AND I WISH
YOU GOODBYE AND GOD SPEED

SD CAVAN
BRIGADIERGENERAL
COMMANDING 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE

AND FOR RECOGNITION OF THEIR WORK IN THE TRENCHES FOR THE PAST THREE
WEEKS THE FOLLOWING WAS SENT FROM THE GOC SECOND DIVISION TO THE
OFFICER COMMANDING THE IRISH GUARDS

THE BRIGADIERGENERAL HAS RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM THE
GOC SECOND DIVISION AND HE WOULD LIKE COS TO ARRANGE THAT
ALL THE MEN HEAR IT SO THAT THEY MAY REALISE HOW FULLY THEIR
SPLENDID EFFORTS ARE APPRECIATED BOTH BY GENERAL HORNE AND HIMSELF

SINCE THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE WENT INTO Z SECTION ON JUNE
6 IT HAS REALLY DONE SPLENDID WORK IN ADDITION TO OPENING UP
AND DEEPENING THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF
SEVERAL DIFFERENT MINOR WORKS IN REAR YOU HAVE DUG AND WIRED A
NEW LINE ACROSS A FRONT OF AT LEAST 2000 YARDS THE 4TH GUARDS
BRIGADE AND THE 11TH COMPANY RE HAVE DONE GREAT WORK ON MANY
PREVIOUS OCCASIONS BUT I THINK THAT THIS LAST ACHIEVEMENT
SURPASSES THEM ALL

MORE THAN ONE PLATOON AT A TIME

SD DESMOND FITZGERALD
CAPTAIN ADJUTANT
1ST BATTALION IRISH GUARDS

26TH JUNE 1915

IT WAS THE BRIGADIERS REFERENCE TO THEIR HAVING PROVED THEMSELVES
WORTHY TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE OTHER REGIMENTS OF THE BRIGADE OF
GUARDS AND MORE SO THAT DELIGHTED THEM MOST FOR THE BATTALION
FELT THAT IT HAD WON ITS SPURS IN EVERY FIELD YET FOR ALL THAT THE
DIARY WHICH UNDER THE WELLWORN OFFICIAL PHRASES REPRESENTS THE
SOUL OF THE REGIMENT AND KNOWS HOW THAT SOUL IS MADE AND TEMPERED
EMPHASIZES THE FACT THAT AT BTHUNE THERE ARE SOME QUITE GOOD
PARADEGROUNDS WHERE A GOOD DEAL OF STEADY DRILL WILL BE CARRIED
OUT AND PLENTY OF COUNTRY FOR ROUTEMARCHING WHERE THE MEN COULD
LEARN HOW TO BEAR THEMSELVES WITHOUT BUDGING BENEATH THE CASUAL
SHELLS THAT DROPPED MILES BEHIND THE LINE

SO THEY RESTED AT BTHUNE AND GAVE A CONCERT IN THE THEATRE TO
WHICH THEY INVITED MANY INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN WHO BEING NEW TO
THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE IRISH COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH
BUT A FRENCH OFFICER SANG THE MARSEILLAISE WITH GREAT EFFECT AND
AT DINNER AFTERWARDS WHEN THE PRINCE OF WALES WAS AMONG THE GUESTS
THERE WERE NOT ONLY RED AND WHITE ROSES ON THE TABLE BUT ACCORDING
TO ONE ACCOUNT SILVER SPOONS AND FORKS PROVIDED BY THE OWNER OF
THE HOUSE IF BTHUNE DID NOT YET COMPREHEND THE SONGS OF THESE WILD
OUTLANDERS IT HAD FULL CONFIDENCE IN THEM


CUINCHY

THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY SAW THEM RETURNED TO THEIR OWN OLD TRENCHES
AT CUINCHYTHE FIFTY TIMES FOUGHTOVER LINE THAT RAN FROM THE LA
BASSE CANAL TO WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE LA BASSEBTHUNE
ROAD A COUPLE OF COMPANIES OF THE HERTS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE
LA BASSE ROAD LAY ON THEIR RIGHT AND RIGHT OF THOSE AGAIN THE
2ND COLDSTREAM THEY BOASTED AS MANY AS SIX MACHINEGUNS IN POSITION
BELONGING TO THE BATTALION AND THREE TO THE 2ND GRENADIERS THEIR
RELIEF THE TRENCHES HAD NOT IMPROVED BY USE SINCE FEBRUARY THERE
WERE MINECRATERS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM THEIR OPPOSING EDGES
OCCUPIED BY OUR MEN AND THE ENEMY THE BREASTWORKS WERE OLD BURSTEN
SANDBAGS FIRESTEPS HAD BROKEN DOWN DUGOUTS WERE INADEQUATE
AGAINST THE LARGESIZE TRENCHMORTAR BOMBS THAT THE GERMANS WERE
USING AND GENERALLY THE CONDITION AND REPAIR OF THINGS WAS
HEARTBREAKING TO THE NEWCOMERS AND THEIR BRIGADIER WHO SPENT MOST
OF HIS TIME NIGHT AND DAY IN THE FRONT LINE

ANNEQUIN WHERE TWO OF THE COMPANIES WERE BILLETED HAD BECOME MORE
THAN EVER A SHELLTRAP FULL OF ENGLISH BATTERIES FOR WHICH THE
GERMANS WERE CONSTANTLY SEARCHING AND SINCE EXPERTS TOLD THEM
THAT WE NOW HAD GOT THE UPPER HAND OF THE ENEMY AT MINING THE
CYNICAL EXPECTED THAT AT ANY MOMENT SOME REALLY BIG MINE WOULD
GO UP BENEATH THEM AS AN INTERLUDE THE COMPANIES IN BILLETS WERE
EMPLOYED IN MAKING DUGOUTS WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL WHICH TRIFLING TASK
THEY SOMEHOW ACCOMPLISHED THE BIG SHELLS AND THE BOMBING FROM THE
TRENCHMORTARS FORCED THEM TO DEEPEN ALL DUGOUTS TO TEN OR TWELVE
FEET THESE WERE SHORED WITH BRICKS AND TOPPED WITH RAILS AS MATERIAL
BECAME MORE PLENTIFUL

ON THE 17TH JULY CAPTAIN A H L MCCARTHY RAMC WHO HAD BROKEN
HIS ARM AT LAPUGNOY SIX WEEKS BEFORE RETURNED TO DUTY AND WAS
MADE WELCOME HIS SICKLEAVE WHICH HE SEEMS TO HAVE FILLED WITH
BESEECHING LETTERS TO THE CO HAD BEEN DARKENED BY A PROSPECT
OF BEING DETACHED FROM THE BATTALION AND SENT TO THE DARDANELLES
FATHER GWYNNE ALSO CAME BACK FROM HIS TWO MONTHS RHEUMATISM
CURE RELIEVING FATHER KNAPP HE WAS NOT QUITE RESTORED AND SO WAS
FORBIDDEN BY THE CO TO SHOW HIMSELF IN THE FRONT LINE FOR AT LEAST
TEN DAYS IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT HE OBEYED BUT IN A BATTALION WHERE
THE CALL FOR THE PRIEST GOES OUT WITH OR BEFORE THE CALL FOR
STRETCHERBEARERS NEITHER SHEPHERDS NOR FLOCK ARE LONG SEPARATED
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY TELL THE TALE OF ONE OF THEIR PRIESTS
WHO UTTERLY WEARIED DROPPED FOR AN HOURS SLEEP IN A TRENCH THAT
WAS BEING DEEPENED UNDER FIRE HE WAS ROUSED BY A RESPECTFUL WHISPER
FROM THE WORKINGPARTY WEVE DUG TO YOUR HEAD AN YOUR FEET
FATHER AN NOW IF YOULL GET UP WELL DIG OUT UNDER THE LENGTH OF
YE

THE BRIGADES SYSTEM OF FORTYEIGHT HOURS RELIEFS ENABLED THEM
TO DO MORE IN A GIVEN TIME THAN BATTALIONS WHO WENT IN FOR FOUR
DAYS AT A STRETCH AS A MAN COULD CARRY TWO DAYS RATIONS ON HIM
WITHOUT DRAWING ON THE FATIGUEPARTIES AND THE KNOWLEDGE HE WOULD
BE RELIEVED AT THE END OF THE TIME KEPT HIS EDGE A BRIGADIER
OF EXPERIENCE COULD TELL ANY SECTION OF THE LINE HELD BY THE
BRIGADE AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE IT SIMPLY FROM THE DEMEANOUR OF
THE WORKINGPARTIES THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS ONLY MAINTAINED
BY UNBROKEN DISCIPLINE AND THE GOSPEL THAT IF ONE MAN CAN KEEP
HIMSELF COMPARATIVELY CLEAN IN ALL THAT DIRT AND CONFUSION EVERY
ONE ELSE CAN IT BEHOVED THE BATTALION ALSO TO MAKE AND LEAVE A
GOOD NAME AMONG THE FRENCH UPON WHOM THEY WERE QUARTERED AS WELL
AS WITH THE ENEMY OVER AGAINST THEM THEY WERE AT THAT TIME AS
FOR LONG AFTERWARDS ALMOST UNMIXED IRISH AND FOR THAT REASON
THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OFFICERS AND MEN WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT
EXISTED ELSEWHERE EVEN IN NOMINALLY PURE IRISH BATTALIONS IF THERE
BE ANY MYSTERY IN THE TRAINING OF WAR THAT SPECIALLY DISTINGUISHES
THE BRIGADE OF GUARDS FROM THEIR FELLOWS IT IS THAT THE OFFICERS
LIE UNDER DISCIPLINE MORE EXACTING THAN THAT OF THE RANK AND FILE
AND THAT EVEN MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER BRANCH OF THE SERVICE THEY
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMFORT OF THEIR MEN FORCED TOGETHER AS
THEY WERE IN THE STARK INTIMACY OF THE TRENCHES THAT AT ANY MOMENT
MAY TEST ANY SOUL TO THE UTTERMOST REVEALED TO EACH OTHER EVERY
OTHER DAY AT LEAST IN THE LONG AND WEARISOME MARCH TO BILLETS
WHERE THE COMPANIES AND PLATOONS MOVE SLOWLY AND SIDEWAYS THROUGH
THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES GAMBLING AGAINST DEATHIF THE GERMAN
HEAVIES ARE BUSYAT EACH STEP OF THE ROAD OFFICERS AND MEN CAME
TO A MUTUAL COMPREHENSION AND AFFECTIONWHICH IN NO WAY PREVENTED
THE MOST DIRECT AND DRASTIC CRITICISM OR PENALTIESAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO DESCRIBE AS IT WOULD BE TO OMIT SINCE IT WAS THE BACKGROUND
AGAINST WHICH THEIR LIVES RAN FROM DAY TO DAY THE CELTS NATIONAL
POISE AND MANNER HIS GIFT OF COURTESY AND SYMPATHY AND ABOVE ALL
THE CURIOUS AND COMMUNICABLE HUMOUR OF HIS OUTLOOK IN THOSE DAYS
MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM AND HIS OFFICERS TO CONSORT TOGETHER UPON
TERMS PERHAPS DEBARRED TO OTHER RACES WHEN THE MEN PRACTISED CRIME
THEY WERE THOROUGH AND INVENTIVE IN THE ACT AND UNEQUALLED IN THE
DEFENCE AS THE RECORDS OF SOME COURTMARTIALS TESTIFY BUT THE SAME
SPIRIT THAT PROMPTED THE LARGE AND IMAGINATIVE SIN AND ITS UNEXPECTED
EXCUSE OR JUSTIFICATION AS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THREE SINNERS DETECTED
IN REMOVING A LARGE CASK OF BEER WERE BUT EXERCISING THEIR MUSCLES
IN ROWLING IT A PIECE ALONG THE PAV BRED A CROP OF FORCEFUL
REGIMENTAL CHARACTERS MANY VERY MANY OF THESE HAVE PERISHED AND
LEFT NO RECORD SAVE THE ECHO OF AMAZING OR QUAINT SAYINGS PASSED FROM
MOUTH TO MOUTH THROUGH THE LONG YEARS OR A BLURRED RECORD OF SOME
DESPERATELY HEROIC DEED LIGHTHEARTEDLY CONCEIVED AND CUNNINGLY
CARRIED THROUGH TO ITS TRIUMPHANT END AND DISMISSED WITH A JEST THE
UNPREDICTABLE INCIDENCE OF DEATH OR WOUNDS WAS A MYSTERY THAT GAVE
THE IRISH FULL REIN FOR SOMBRE SPECULATION HALF AN HOURS FURIOUS
BOMBARDMENT WITH TRENCHES BLOWING IN BY LENGTHS AT A TIME WOULD
END IN NO MORE THAN EXTRA FATIGUES FOR THE DISGUSTED WORKINGPARTIES
THAT HAD TO REPAIR DAMAGE ON ANOTHER DAY OF STILL PEACE ONE SUDDEN
LIGHT SHELL MIGHT MANGLE EVERY MAN IN A BAY AND SMEAR THE DUCKBOARDS
WITH BLOOD AND HORRORS A NIGHTPATROL PINNED DOWN BY A GERMAN
FLARE WHERE THEY SPRAWLED IN THE CORN AND MACHINEGUNNED TILL
THEIR LISTENING COMRADES GAVE UP ALL HOPE WOULD TUMBLE BACK AT LAST
INTO THEIR OWN TRENCHES UNSCATHED WHILE FAR BACK IN SOME SHELTERED
CORNER THE SKIED BULLET FALLING FROM A MILE AND A HALF AWAY WOULD
SEND A MAN TO HIS ACCOUNT SO SILENTLY THAT TILL THE BODY SLID OFF
THE ESTAMINET BENCH HIS NEIGHBOURS NEVER GUESSED THE IRONIES AND
EXTRAVAGANCES OF FATE WERE SO MANY SO ABSURD AND SO TERRIBLE
THAT AFTER A WHILE HUMAN NATURE CEASED TO TAKE CONSCIOUS ACCOUNT OF
THEM OR CLUTCHED AT THE SMALLEST TRIFLES THAT COULD CHANGE A MINDS
CURRENT THE SUREST ANODYNE AND ONE THAT A PRUDENT COMMANDING OFFICER
TOOK CARE TO PROVIDE WAS THAT ALL HANDS SHOULD HAVE PLENTY TO DO
TO REPAIR A BREACH OR TO CUT A FIRESTEP WAS NOT ENOUGH THERE WAS
A STANDARD IN THESE MATTERS TO BE LIVED UP TO WHICH WAS INSISTED
UPON THROUGH ALL THE DAYS OF TRENCHWARFARE NONE KNEW HOW LONG THE
DEADLOCK WOULD LAST OR WHEN THE ENEMY WEARIED OF MINING BOMBS AND
HEAVY ARTILLERY MIGHT ATTEMPT A BREAKTHROUGH WHEN THE FIRST LINE
WAS CLEANED AND CONSOLIDATED AND FINISHED WITH WHAT WAS DEEMED THEN
AMPLE DUGOUT ACCOMMODATION SUPPORTING PARTIES BEHIND IT HAD TO BE
BROUGHT UP TO A LIKE LEVEL AND SO ON

THE ENEMY AT THAT TIME ON THAT LINE INTERFERED VERY LITTLE
THEY RIGGED A SEARCHLIGHT ON ONE OF THE BRICKSTACKS IN THEIR
POSSESSION ONE EVENING BUT TOOK IT DOWN AFTER OUR GUNS HAD
PROTESTED OCCASIONALLY THEY SHELLED BTHUNE WHILE TRYING TO HIT
AN OBSERVATIONBALLOON NEAR THE TOWN AND SOMETIMES THEY BOMBED
WITH TRENCHMORTARS THERE WERE HOWEVER DAYS ON END WHEN NOTHING
COULD STIR THEM UP OR WHEN A FEW AUTHORITATIVE WARNINGS FROM OUR
GUNS WOULD CUT SHORT A DEMONSTRATION ALMOST AS IT BEGAN THEY WERE
BOMBED FOR SOME HOURS TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE CRATERS AND TO COVER
OUR MEN AT WORK IN THIS WORK NO 4906 PRIVATE HENRY WON THE DCM
IN CONTINUING TO THROW BOMBS THOUGH TWICE WOUNDED THE IRISH ARE
GIFTED AT HURLING THINGS TILL HE WAS AT LAST ORDERED OFF THE FIELD
THE ENEMY REPLIED WITH EVERYTHING EXCEPT RIFLEFIRE AND IN THE
DARKNESS OF A RAINY NIGHT HIS MACHINEGUNS CAUSED SOME ANNOYANCE
TILL AFTER OUR ARTILLERY HAD FAILED TO FIND THEM THE BATTALION
TRENCHMORTARS SILENCED THEM AND ALLOWED US TO FINISH DIGGING THE NEW
TRENCHES AND SAP THE WHOLE AFFAIR LASTED FOUR HOURS AND WAS CARRIED
OUT BY NO 1 COMPANY UNDER CAPTAIN M V GORELANGTON AT THE COST
OF 1 MAN KILLED 1 OFFICER LIEUTENANT THE HON H A V HARMSWORTH
SLIGHTLY WOUNDED AND 7 MEN WOUNDED

ON THE 3RD AUGUST LIEUTENANT H F LAW WAS SENT OUT WITH A PATROL
TO EXAMINE YET ANOTHER MINECRATER CLOSE TO THE TWO WHICH THE
BATTALION HAD OCCUPIED ON ITS FIRST NIGHT HE THREW BOMBS INTO IT
FOUND IT EMPTY AND THE COMPANIES BEGAN AT ONCE TO DIG UP TO IT FROM
TWO POINTS AND MAKE IT ALL THEIR OWN THE ENEMY INTERFERED WITH
THE WORKINGPARTIES FOR A WHILE BUT WAS BOMBED OFF AT DAYBREAK HE
RETALIATED WITH A METHODICAL BOMBARDMENT ALONG THE LINE OF SEVENINCH
MINENWERFERSONE EVERY THREE MINUTESFOR AN HOUR AND A HALF THESE
COULD BE SEEN DROPPING PERPENDICULARLY ERE THEY EXPLODED BUT THEY
DID NO GREAT DAMAGE AND THE REST OF THE DAY WAS PEACEFUL TILL A
SUDDEN THUNDERSTORM MADE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ABOMINABLY DIRTY
ADDITIONAL FATIGUES ARE ALWAYS MORE RESENTED THAN ANY ADDITIONAL
RISKS OF DEATH

WHEN THEY CAME UP AGAIN ON THE 6TH AUGUST THEY FOUND THAT AN ENEMY
MINE IN THE ORCHARD HAD EXPLODED WOUNDING SEVERAL OF THE GRENADIERS
WHOM THEY WERE RELIEVING AND DONE DAMAGE TO SOME OF OUR OWN WORK
WHILE THEY WERE MAKING GOOD THE MINING COMPANY OVERHEARD GERMANS AT
WORK IN A GALLERY A FEW FEET FROM ONE OF OURS THE MEN WERE WITHDRAWN
AT ONCE FROM THE FORWARD LINE TILL DAWN WHEN OUR MINE WAS SPRUNG TO
ANTICIPATE ENEMY ACTION IT MIGHT HAVE INJURED SOME OF THE ENEMYS
WORK BUT IT CERTAINLY DISORGANIZED SEVERAL OF OUR OWN SAPHEADS
WHICH HAD TO BE REDUG

INTO THE VARIEGATED ACTIVITIES OF THAT MORNING DROPPED A STAFF
OFFICER OF THE FIRST ARMY CORPS ANXIOUS TO GET THE COS NOTES AND
INSTRUCTIONS ON MINING FOR NEW TROOPS WHO MIGHT LATER HAVE TO HOLD
THAT LINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANNER TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCE
CAPTAIN J H T PRIESTMAN OF THE LINCOLNSHIRES A SANDHURST
INSTRUCTOR ARRIVED WITH HIM AND WAS ATTACHED TO THE SECTOR FOR A
FEW DAYS TO SEE HOW THINGS WERE CARRIED ON AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN
ROUND THE TRENCHES BY THE CO AND THE ADJUTANT NEXT MORNING A
PRIVATE ON SENTRY WITH A BOMBER TRIED TO THROW A BOMB ON HIS OWN
ACCOUNT BUT SAYS THE DIARY NOT KNOWING HOW TO HE BLEW HIMSELF UP
AND WOUNDED THE BOMBER BY BREAKFAST TIME THE ENEMY WERE SHELLING
THE LINE IN ENFILADE FROM THE DIRECTION OF AUCHY AND TWO MEN WERE
BLOWN TO PIECES A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER THE BOMBARDMENT WAS REPEATED
WITH FROM FIRST TO LAST 6 KILLED AND 9 WOUNDED THE INSTRUCTOR WAS
BUT ONE OF MANY WHOSE UNREGARDED DUTY WAS TO STUDY AT FIRST HAND
EVERY DEVICE OF THE ENEMY IN ACTION AND TO LECTURE UPON IT AT THE
TRAININGCENTRES IN ENGLAND A FEW DAYS LATER

THE BATTALION RELIEVED THE GRENADIERS ONCE MORE ON THE 10TH AUGUST
AFTER ANOTHER GERMAN MINE HAD BEEN EXPLODED ON THE SALIENT AND HAD
CARRIED AWAY SO MUCH GERMAN WIRE THAT IT SEEMED POSSIBLE TO EFFECT
AN ENTRY INTO THEIR TRENCHES ACROSS THE NEWMADE CRATER A PATROL
UNDER LIEUTENANT A F L GORDON WAS THEREFORE SENT OUT AT NIGHT BUT
REPORTED THE SLOPES TOO STEEP TO CLIMB AND SINCE ANOTHER MINE HAD
GONE UP AND DESTROYED FOUR OF OUR OWN SAPHEADS WITH IT THE NIGHT
WAS SPENT IN REPAIRING THESE UNDER INTERMITTENT BOMBFIRE ON BOTH
SIDES

ON THE 11TH AUGUST FRESH ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO WORK SOME SORT OF
FOOTHOLD ACROSS THE CRATERPITTED GROUND INTO THE ENEMYS TRENCHES
SPECIALLY AT THE SPOT WHERE A CRATER HAD BEEN PARTIALLY FILLED
UP BY THE EXPLOSION OF A FRESH MINE THE DAY WAS QUIET CAPTAIN
M V GORELANGTON SPENT THE EVENING OF IT IN RECONNOITRING THE
ENEMYS WIRE WENT OUT ACROSS THE PARTLY FILLED CRATER FOUND YET
ANOTHER CRATER WHICH RAN INTO THE ENEMYS LINE AND THERE MET ONE
GERMAN LYING OUT WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HIM WHOM PRIVATE DEMPSEY
HIS ORDERLY KILLED THEREBY ROUSING THE ENEMY IN THAT PARTICULAR
POINT THEY OPENED WITH BOMBS ON A PARTY OF OURS AT WORK ON A SAP
IN ONE OF THE INNUMERABLE CRATERS AND WERE DISCOMFITED FOR THE
MOMENT AN HOUR LATER CAPTAIN GORELANGTON WITH ONE MAN WENT
OUT FOR THE SECOND TIME ACROSS THE SAME CRATER TO PUT UP SOME MORE
WIRE HE FELL INTO THE ARMS OF A GERMAN BOMBING PARTY WAS KNOCKED
DOWN THRICE BY EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS AROUND HIM AND ONLY GOT BACK
TO THE TRENCHES WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THE CO COLONEL TREFUSIS
THEN REMONSTRATED WITH HIM ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT IS NOT THE
COMPANY COMMANDERS BUSINESS TO GO OUT WIRING ON THE HEELS OF
THIS ENTERPRISE A REALLY VICIOUS FIGHT WITH MACHINEGUNS AS WELL
AS BOMBS DEVELOPED IN THE DARK IT WAS SILENCED BY FOUR ROUNDS
OF OUR HOWITZERS WHEN THE ROAR OF THE BOMBS STOPPED AS THOUGH BY
ORDER A THIRD AFFAIR BROKE OUT JUST ON DAWN WHEN OUR MEN FOUND
ENEMY WORKINGPARTIES IN CRATERS BELOW THEM AND BOMBED WITH THEM
EXCEEDINGLY FOR THE GERMANS WERE NOT GOOD LONGRANGE THROWERS

ON THE MORNING OF THE 12TH AUGUST CAME GENERAL HORNE TO LOOK AT THE
POSITION WHICH HE EXAMINED LEISURELY FROM EVERY PART OF THE LINE
INSTEAD OF MERELY THROUGH THE COVERED LOOPHOLES WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT
FOR HIS CONVENIENCE I WAS GLAD WHEN I GOT HIM SAFELY OUT OF IT
WROTE THE CO FOR ONE NEVER KNOWS WHEN BOMBS MAY COME OVER JUST
BEFORE THEY WERE RELIEVED THE CO COLONEL TREFUSIS WAS TELEPHONED
WORD THAT HE WAS TO COMMAND THE 20TH BRIGADE AND WAS PATHETICALLY
GRIEVED AT HIS PROMOTION HE HATED LEAVING THE BATTALION WHICH AFTER
ELEVEN MONTHS OF BETTER OR WORSE HE HAD COME TO LOOK UPON AS HIS
OWN NO MAN COULD POSSIBLY WISH TO COMMAND A BETTER HE WAS GOING TO
A BRIGADE WHERE HE KNEW NO ONE AND HIS HOPE WAS THAT HE MIGHT BE
ALLOWED TO REMAIN ONE DAY MORE WITH THE BATTALION WHEN IT GOES TO
THE TRENCHES BEFORE GOING INTO RESERVE HE HAD HIS WISH WHEN THEY
WENT INTO THE LINE ON THE 14TH AUGUST AND HE FACED THE ORDEAL WORSE
THAN WAR OF SAYING GOODBYE TO EACH COMPANY IN THE MORNING AND AT
EVENING WENT ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NIGHT COMPANIES HAD PLENTY
OF BOMBERS IN THE PROPER PLACES BOMBS WERE THE ONE TOOL AT THAT
TIME WHICH COULD DEAL WITH NESTS OF OCCUPIED CRATERS AND SINCE THE
WORK WAS DANGEROUS THE IRISH WERE QUALIFYING FOR IT WITH ZEAL AND
INTEREST EVEN THOUGH THEY OCCASIONALLY DROPPED OR RELEASED BOMBS BY
ACCIDENT

THEY WERE RELIEVED AUGUST 15 BY A BATTALION FROM THE 5TH BRIGADE
WHO HAD HEARD ALL SORTS OF DREADFUL STORIES ABOUT THE POSITION
BUT I TOLD THEM SAID COLONEL TREFUSIS IT WAS NOT SO BAD
PROVIDED THEIR BOMBERS KEPT ON BOMBING AT NIGHT MINES OF COURSE
ONE CANNOT HELP AND THE ONLY WAY TO MINIMISE THEIR EFFECT IS TO KEEP
AS FEW MEN IN THE FRONT LINE AS POSSIBLE

AND SO COLONEL THE HON J TREFUSIS PASSES OUT OF THE BATTALIONS
STORY TO HIS NEW HEADQUARTERS AND HIS NEW STAFF AND BOMBING
OFFICERS AND HIS BRANDNEW TROOPS WHO SIMPLY OUT OF CURIOSITY TO
SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON PUT THEIR HEADS OVER THE PARAPET WHILE UNDER
INSTRUCTION AND SO LOST TWO MEN SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD WHICH I HOPE
WILL BE A LESSON TO THEM

HE HAD COMMANDED THE BATTALION SINCE NOVEMBER 1914 AND NO SUDDEN
OCCASION HAD FOUND HIM WANTING THE DIARY SAYS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO SAY ALL THAT HE HAS DONE FOR THE BATTALION AND INDEED
HIGH COURAGE UNBROKEN HUMOUR A COOL HEAD SKILL AND INFINITE
UNSELFISHNESS ARE DIFFICULT THINGS TO SET DOWN IN WORDS HE WAS
SUCCEEDED IN THE COMMAND BY MAJOR G H C MADDEN WHO ARRIVED FROM
ENGLAND ON THE 16TH AUGUST WHEN THE BATTALION WAS IN REST AT BTHUNE
AND THE HANDS OF THEIR COMPANY AND PLATOON OFFICERS WERE CLOSING UPON
THEM TO MAKE SURE ONCE MORE THAT SUCH UNTIDY BUSINESS AS MINING
COUNTERMINING AND CRATERFIGHTING HAD NOT DIMINISHED SMARTNESS
ON PARADE THIS WAS DOUBLY NEEDFUL SINCE THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE
CEASED ON THE 19TH AUGUST TO BE PART OF THE FIRST ARMY AND BECAME
THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE IN THE NEWLY FORMED GUARDS DIVISION OF FOUR
BATTALIONS GRENADIERS FOUR COLDSTREAM TWO SCOTS TWO IRISH AND THE
WELSH GUARDS

THE 2ND BATTALION OF THE IRISH GUARDS RAISED AT WARLEY LEFT ENGLAND
FOR FRANCE ON THE 17TH AUGUST

PREPARATIONS ON WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED AN OVERWHELMING SCALE
WERE UNDER WAY TO BREAK THE GERMAN LINE NEAR LOOS WHILE THE FRENCH
ATTACKED SERIOUSLY IN THE CHAMPAGNE COUNTRY THE IDEA BEING TO
ARRIVE AT THE LONGDREAMEDOF BATTLE OF MANUVRE IN THE PLAIN
OF THE SCHELDT GUNS GASSMOKE APPARATUS AND MATERIAL HAD BEEN
COLLECTED DURING THE SUMMER LULL EXISTING COMMUNICATIONS HAD BEEN
MORE OR LESS IMPROVED THOUGH THE NECESSITY FOR FEEDERRAILWAYS WAS
NOT AT ALL REALISED TANKS WERE NOT YET CREATED AND THE PROPORTION
OF MACHINEGUNS TO INFANTRY WAS RATHER BELOW ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS
AS COMPARED WITH LATER YEARS OUR ARMIES WERE GOING INTO ACTION WITH
HAMMERS AND THEIR BARE HANDS ACROSS A BREADTH OF DENSELY OCCUPIED
TUNNELLED AND ELABORATELY FORTIFIED MINING COUNTRY WHERE AS ONE
WRITER OBSERVED THERE IS TWICE AS MUCH BELOW GROUND AS THERE
IS ABOVE CONSEQUENTLY FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME WITHIN A
TWELVEMONTH ENGLAND WAS TO LEARN AT THE COST OF SCORES OF THOUSANDS
OF CASUALTIES THAT MODERN WARFARE UNLIKE PRIVATE THEATRICALS DOES
NOT COME RIGHT AT THE PERFORMANCE UNLESS THERE HAVE BEEN REHEARSALS

THE TRAINING OF THE MEN IN THE FORMS OF ATTACK ANTICIPATED WENT
FORWARD ENERGETICALLY BEHIND THE FRONT LINES TOGETHER WITH
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MASSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND
TROOPS OF THE FIRST ARMY FIRST AND FOURTH CORPS ASSIGNED TO THE
ATTACK FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS OR SO THE IRISH GUARDS WERE UNDER
INSTRUCTION TO THAT END AND THE TRENCHES KNEW THEM NO MORE

THERE WAS A FORMAL LEAVETAKING AS THEY LEFT BTHUNE FOR ST HILAIRE
WHEN THE EX4TH GUARDS BRIGADE WAS PLAYED OUT OF BTHUNE BY THE
BAND OF THE 1ST KINGS LIVERPOOLS AND MARCHED PAST GENERAL HORNE
COMMANDING THE SECOND DIVISION BETWEEN LINES OF CHEERING MEN A
COMPANY OF THE TRUSTY HERTS TERRITORIALS WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE
BRIGADE SINCE 1914 TOOK PART IN THE CEREMONY IT WAS REPEATED NEXT
DAY BEFORE SIR DOUGLAS HAIG AT CHAMPAGNE AND AGAIN IN THE CENTRAL
SQUARE OF ST OMER WHEN SIR JOHN FRENCH THANKED ALL RANKS FOR THE
SPLENDID SERVICES THEY HAD RENDERED AND WAS MUCH IMPRESSED WITH
THEIR SOLDIERLIKE BEARING

MAJORGENERAL HORNES SPECIAL FAREWELL ORDER RAN AS FOLLOWS

18TH AUGUST 1915

THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE LEAVES THE SECOND DIVISION TOMORROW
THE GOC SPEAKS NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR EVERY OFFICER
NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND MAN OF THE DIVISION WHEN HE EXPRESSES
SORROW THAT CERTAIN CHANGES IN ORGANISATION HAVE RENDERED NECESSARY
THE SEVERANCE OF TIES OF COMRADESHIP COMMENCED IN PEACE AND
CEMENTED BY WAR

FOR THE PAST YEAR BY GALLANTRY DEVOTION TO DUTY AND SACRIFICE
IN BATTLES AND IN THE TRENCHES THE BRIGADE HAS MAINTAINED THE
HIGH TRADITIONS OF HIS MAJESTYS GUARDS AND EQUALLY BY THOROUGH
PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES STRICT DISCIPLINE AND THE EXHIBITION OF
MANY SOLDIERLIKE QUALITIES HAS SET AN EXAMPLE OF SMARTNESS WHICH
HAS TENDED TO RAISE THE STANDARD AND ELEVATE THE MORALE OF ALL WITH
WHOM IT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED

A HOT NINETEENMILE MARCH DURING WHICH ONLY FIVE MEN FELL OUT IT WAS
AT ST PIERRE BETWEEN THIEMBRONNE AND ACQUIN THAT THEY MET AND DINED
WITH THE 2ND BATTALION OF THE REGIMENT WHICH HAD LANDED IN FRANCE
ON THE 18TH AUGUST THERE ARE FEW RECORDS OF THIS HISTORIC MEETING
FOR THE YOUTH AND THE STRENGTH THAT GATHERED BY THE COOKERS IN THAT
OPEN SUNLIT FIELD BY ST PIERRE HAS BEEN SEVERAL TIMES WIPED OUT AND
REPLACED THE TWO BATTALIONS CONFERRED TOGETHER BY RANK AND BY AGE

THEY PARTED

THE NEXT THREE WEEKS WERE SPENT BY THE 1ST BATTALION AT OR NEAR
THIEMBRONNE IN TRAINING FOR THE GREAT BATTLE TO COME THEY WERE
INSTRUCTED IN MARCHDISCIPLINE INFANTRY ATTACK EXTENDEDORDER
DRILL AND FIELDTRAINING ATTACKS ON VILLAGES DRIONVILLE WAS ONE
OF THEM SELECTED AND THE FRENCH VILLAGERS ATTENDED THE FIELDDAY
IN GREAT NUMBERS AS WELL AS IN BUSSING AND DEBUSSING AGAINST
TIME INTO MOTORBUSES WHICH WERE THEN BEGINNING TO BE MODERATELY
PLENTIFUL REGIMENTAL SPORTS WERE NOT FORGOTTENTHEY WERE A
GREAT SUCCESS AND AN AMUSEMENT MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIBLE TO THE
PEOPLE OF THIEMBRONNEAND SINCE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS AWARE THAT
A COMBINED ATTACK WOULD BE MADE SHORTLY BY THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH
ARMIES THE OFFICERS OF THE GUARDS BRIGADE WERE DULY INFORMED BY
LIEUTENANTGENERAL HAKING COMMANDING THE ELEVENTH ARMY CORPS TO
WHICH THE GUARDS DIVISION BELONGED THAT SUCH INDEED WAS THE CASE

THE DOMESTIC CONCERNS OF THE BATTALION DURING THIS PAUSE INCLUDE THE
FACTS THAT 2ND LIEUTENANT DAMESLONGSWORTH FROM THE 2ND MIDDLESEX
WAS ATTACHED ON THE 9TH SEPTEMBER PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO THE IRISH
GUARDS CAPTAIN C D WYNTER LIEUTENANT F H WITTS AND 2ND

LONDON GAZETTE AND THE C O MAJOR G H C MADDEN WAS ON THE
6TH SEPTEMBER GAZETTED A TEMPORARY LIEUTENANTCOLONEL THESE WERE THE
FIRST GRANTS OF TEMPORARY RANK IN THE BATTALION

ON THE 18TH SEPTEMBER THE COS OF ALL THE BATTALIONS IN THE GUARDS
DIVISION MOTORED TO THE BTHUNE DISTRICT WHERE A RECONNAISSANCE
WAS MADE FROM CONVENIENT OBSERVATIONPOSTS OF THE COUNTRY BETWEEN
CUINCHY AND LOOS THAT THEY MIGHT JUDGE THE WEIGHT OF THE TASK BEFORE
THEM

BACKGROUND AMPLE RAILWAYS AND A MULTITUDE OF ROADS LAY READY TO
LAUNCH FRESH TROOPS TO ANY POINT THAT MIGHT BY ANY CHANCE BE FORCED
IN THE FACE OF THESE OBSTACLES

OUR ARMIES WERE BROUGHT UP FOR THE MOST PART ON THEIR OWN FEET AND
LAY IN TRENCHES NOT IN THE LEAST CONCRETED NOR WERE OUR ROADS

ON THE EVE OF THE GREATEST BATTLE IN THE WORLDS HISTORY REMINDED
THEM THAT THE FATE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS HUNG ON THE ISSUE AND THAT
GREAT THINGS WERE EXPECTED OF THE GUARDS DIVISION THEY KNEW IT WELL
ENOUGH

BY A PIECE OF ILLLUCK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS AN OMEN THE
DAY BEFORE THEY MOVED FROM THIEMBRONNE TO THE FRONT A BOMBING
ACCIDENT AT PRACTICE CAUSED THE DEATH OF LANCESERGEANT R MATTHEWS
AND THREE MEN WHICH FEW CASUALTIES ON THE EVE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS
TO COME WERE DUE SUBJECTS OF A COURT OF INQUIRY AND A FULL REPORT
TO HEADQUARTERS THEN THEY MARCHED BY CAPELLESURLYS TO NEDON IN
MIST AND GATHERING RAIN AS THE AUTUMN WEATHER BROKE ON THE 24TH
AND HEARD THE ROAR OF WHAT SEEMED CONTINUOUS BOMBARDMENT FROM VIMY
TO LA BASSE BUT IT WAS AT DAWN ON THE 25TH SEPTEMBER THAT THE
SERIOUS WORK OF THE HEAVY GUNS BEGAN WHILE THE DIVISION CRAWLED IN
POURING RAIN ALONG CONGESTED ROADS FROM NEDON TO NUXLESMINES ALL
THEY COULD SEE OF THE BATTLEFRONT WAS VEILED IN CLOUDS OF GAS AND
THE SCREENS OF COVERING SMOKE THROUGH WHICH OUR ATTACKS HAD BEEN
LAUNCHED AFTER TWO HOURS OF PRELIMINARY BOMBARDMENT OUR TROOPS
THERE FOUND AS CHANCE AND ACCIDENT DECREED EITHER BROKEN WIRE AND
HALFOBLITERATED TRENCHES EASY TO OVERPASS FOR A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
TILL THEY CAME TO THE UNCUT STUFF BEFORE WHICH THE MEN PERISHED AS
THEIR LIKES HAD DONE ON LIKE FIELDS SO IT HAPPENED THAT DAY TO THE
6TH BRIGADE OF THE FIRST DIVISION NORTH OF LA BASSE AND THE 19TH
BRIGADE SOUTH OF IT TO THE 28TH BRIGADE OF THE NINTH DIVISION BY
THE HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT AND PIT 8 THESE ALL MET WIRE UNCUT BEFORE
TRENCHES UNTOUCHED AND WERE SLAUGHTERED THE 26TH BRIGADE OF THE
NINTH DIVISION BROKE THROUGH AT A HEAVY COST AS FAR AS PIT 8 AND
FOR THE MOMENT AS FAR AS THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE OF HAISNES THE
SEVENTH DIVISION WORKING BETWEEN THE NINTH DIVISION AND THE ROAD
FROM VERMELLES TO HULLUCH HAD BETTER FORTUNE THEY PENETRATED AS FAR
AS THE EDGE OF HULLUCH VILLAGE BUT WERE DRIVEN BACK ERE THE DAYS
END TO THE QUARRIES A THOUSAND YARDS IN THE REAR ONE BRIGADE THE
1ST OF THE FIRST DIVISION OF THE FOURTH ARMY ON THEIR RIGHT HAD
ALSO PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE OUTSKIRTS OF HULLUCH ITS 2ND BRIGADE
WAS HUNG UP IN BARBED WIRE NEAR LONE TREE TO THE SOUTHWARD WHICH
CHECK AGAIN EXPOSED THE LEFT FLANK OF THE NEXT FIFTEENTH HIGHLAND
DIVISION AS THAT 44TH 45TH AND 46TH BRIGADES MADE ITS WAY INTO
LOOS CARRIED HILL 70 THE CHALK PIT AND PIT 14 THE FORTYSEVENTH
DIVISION ON THE EXTREME RIGHT OF THE BRITISH LINE AT ITS JUNCTION
WITH THE FRENCH TENTH ARMY HAD TO BE USED MAINLY AS A DEFENSIVE FLANK
TO THE OPERATION SINCE THE FRENCH ATTACK WHICH SHOULD HAVE TIMED
WITH OURS DID NOT DEVELOP TILL SIX HOURS AFTER OUR TROOPS HAD GOT
AWAY AND WAS THEN LIMITED TO SOUCHEZ AND THE VIMY RIDGE

AT NOON ON THE 25TH SEPTEMBER THE POSITION STOOD THUS THE FIRST
ARMY CORPS HELD UP BETWEEN THE BTHUNELA BASSE CANAL AND THE
HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT THE SEVENTH DIVISION HARD PRESSED AMONG THE
QUARRIES AND HOUSES BY HULLUCH THE NINTH IN LITTLE BETTER CASE AS
REGARDED PIT 8 AND THE REDOUBT ITSELF THE HIGHLAND DIVISION PUSHED
FORWARD IN THE RIGHT CENTRE HOLDING ON PRECARIOUSLY IN THE SHAMBLES
ROUND LOOS AND BEING ALREADY FORCED BACK FOR LACK OF SUPPORTS

ALL ALONG THE LINE THE ATTACK HAD SPENT ITSELF AMONG UNCUT WIRE AND
UNSUBDUED MACHINEGUN POSITIONS THERE WERE NO MORE TROOPS TO FOLLOW
AT ONCE ON THE HEELS OF THE FIRST NOR WAS THERE TIME TO DIG IN
BEFORE THE COUNTERATTACKS WERE DELIVERED BY THE GERMANS TO WHOM
EVERY MINUTE OF DELAY MEANT THE CERTAINTY OF MORE AVAILABLE RESERVES
FRESH FROM THE RAIL A LITTLE AFTER NOON THEIR PRESSURE BEGAN TO
TAKE EFFECT AND GROUND WON DURING THE FIRST RUSH OF THE ADVANCE WAS
BLASTED OUT OF OUR POSSESSION BY GUNFIRE BOMBING AND FLOODS OF
ENEMY TROOPS ARRIVING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT

BOTH SIDES WERE NOW BRINGING UP RESERVES BUT OURS SEEM TO HAVE
ARRIVED SOMEWHAT MORE SLOWLY THAN THE GERMANS

THE GUARDS DIVISION HAD COME UP ON FOOT AS QUICKLY AS THE TRAFFIC ON
THE ROADS ALLOWED AND BY THE MORNING OF THE 26TH THE 1ST BRIGADE
2ND GRENADIERS 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM AND 1ST IRISH WERE MARCHED
TO SAILLYLABOURSE THE WEATHER HAD IMPROVED THOUGH THE GROUND WAS
HEAVY ENOUGH LOOS STILL REMAINED TO US HULLUCH WAS UNTAKEN THE
ENEMY WERE WELL ESTABLISHED ON HILL 70 AND HAD DRIVEN US OUT OF PIT
14 AND THE CHALK PIT QUARRY ON THE LENSLA BASSE ROAD WHICH HAD
BEEN WON ON THE PREVIOUS DAY IT WAS THIS SECTOR OF THE LINE TO WHICH
THE 2ND AND 3RD BRIGADES OF THE GUARDS DIVISION WERE DIRECTED THE
LOCAL RESERVES 21ST AND 24TH DIVISIONS HAD BEEN USED UP AND AS THE
BRIGADE TOOK OVER THE GROUND WERE RETIRING DIRECTLY THROUGH THEM THE
1ST GUARDS BRIGADE WAS EMPLOYED IN THE WORK OF HOLDING THE GROUND TO
THE LEFT OR NORTH OF THE OTHER TWO BRIGADES THEIR OWN LEFT LAY
NEXT WHAT REMAINED OF THE SEVENTH DIVISION AFTER THE FURIOUS WASTAGE
OF THE PAST TWO DAYS

ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 26TH SEPTEMBER THE 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM
WITH THE 2ND GRENADIERS IN SUPPORT OCCUPIED SOME TRENCHES IN A
WASTE OF CUTUP GROUND EAST OF A LINE OF CAPTURED GERMAN TRENCHES
OPPOSITE HULLUCH THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS LAY IN TRENCHES CLOSE TO THE
WRECKED WATERTOWER OF THE VILLAGE OF VERMELLES WHILE THE CONFUSED
AND IRREGULAR ATTACKS AND COUNTERATTACKS BROKE OUT ALONG THE LINE
SLACKENED AND WERE RENEWED AGAIN BENEATH THE VAULT OF THE OVERHEAD
CLAMOUR BUILT BY THE PASSAGE OF COUNTLESS SHELLS

THE FIELD OF BATTLE PRESENTED AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT OF DISPERSION
AND DETACHMENT GAS SMOKE AND THE CONTINUOUS SPLASH AND SPARKLE OF
BOMBS MARKED WHERE THE LINES WERE IN ACTUAL TOUCH BUT BEHIND AND
OUTSIDE THIS INFERNO STRETCHED A DESOLATION OF EMPTINESS PEOPLED
WITH SINGLE FIGURES WALKING ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE AS ONE
OBSERVER WROTE WITH DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE GROUND AND CASUALTIES
BEING SLOWLY CONVEYED TO DRESSINGSTATIONSEVERY ONE APPARENTLY
UNCONCERNED BENEATH SHELLFIRE WHICH IN OLDTIME BATTLES WOULD HAVE
BEEN RECKONED HEAVY BUT WHICH HERE BY COMPARISON WAS PEACE

A PREMATURE BURST OF ONE OF OUR OWN SHELLS WOUNDED FOUR MEN OF THE
BATTALIONS MACHINEGUN GROUP AS IT WAS MOVING ALONG THE HULLUCH
ROAD BUT THERE WERE NO OTHER CASUALTIES REPORTED AND ON SUNDAY
27TH WHILE THE VILLAGE OF VERMELLES WAS BEING HEAVILY SHELLED NO
2 AND HALF OF NO 3 COMPANY WERE SENT FORWARD TO FETCH OFF WHAT
WOUNDED LAY IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THEM ON THE BATTLEFIELD THERE
WAS NEED THROUGHOUT THAT LONG SUNDAY OF CLEARING UP AT A SLOW
PACE UNDER SCATTERED FIRE THE CASUALTIES WERE BUT ELEVEN IN ALL2ND
LIEUTENANT GRAYLINGMAJOR SLIGHTLY WOUNDED ONE MAN KILLED AND NINE
WOUNDED THREE THOUSAND YARDS TO THE LEFT THEIR 2ND BATTALION WHICH
WITH THE 2ND AND 3RD GUARDS BRIGADES HAD BEEN SET TO RECAPTURE PIT
14 AND CHALKPIT WOOD LOST THAT EVENING EIGHT OFFICERS AND OVER
THREE HUNDRED MEN KILLED AND WOUNDED OFFICERLOSSES HAD BEEN VERY
HEAVY AND ORDERS WERE ISSUED NONE TOO SOON TO KEEP A RESERVE
OF THEM SPECIALLY IN THE JUNIOR RANKS LIEUTENANTS YERBURGH AND
RANKIN WITH 2ND LIEUTENANTS LAW LANGRISHE AND WALKER WERE THUS
SENT BACK TO THE FIRSTLINE TRANSPORT TO BE SAVED FOR CONTINGENCIES
2ND LIEUTENANT CHRISTIE AND TWENTY MEN FROM THE BASE JOINED ON THE
SAME DAY THE BATTALION LAY AT THAT TIME BEHIND THE REMNANTS OF
THE 20TH BRIGADE OF THE SEVENTH DIVISION WHOSE BRIGADIER COLONEL
THE HON J TREFUSIS HAD BEEN THEIR OLD CO HIS BRIGADE WHICH
HAD SUFFERED BETWEEN TWO AND THREE THOUSAND CASUALTIES WAS IN NO
SHAPE FOR FURTHER FIGHTING BUT WAS HANGING ON IN EXPECTATION OF
RELIEF IF POSSIBLE FROM THE MIXED DUTIES OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH
A LINE AND SENDING OUT PARTIES TO ASSIST IN REPELLING THE NEAREST
COUNTERATTACK FIGHTING CONTINUED EVERYWHERE ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT
OF THE LINE AND HEAVY RAIN ADDED TO THE GENERAL MISERY

BY THE 28TH SEPTEMBER WE MIGHT HAVE GAINED ON AN AVERAGE THREE
THOUSAND YARDS ON A FRONT OF BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN THOUSAND BUT
THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY THAT WE COULD HOLD IT AND THE FRONT WAS
ALIVE WITH REPORTSSOME TRUE OTHERS FALSETHAT THE ENEMY HAD
CAPTURED A LINE OF TRENCH HERE BROKEN THROUGH THERE OR WAS MASSING
IN FORCE ELSEWHERE AS A MATTER OF FACT THE WORST OF THE GERMAN
ATTACKS HAD SPENT THEMSELVES AND BOTH SIDES WERE THROUGH THEIR OWN
DIFFICULTIES BEGINNING TO BREAK OFF THEIR MAIN ENGAGEMENTS FOR THE
BITTER LOCALISED FIGHTINGS THAT GO TO THE MAKING OF A NEW FRONT

IN RAIN CHALKY SLIME AND DEEP DISCOMFORT AFTER UTTER EXHAUSTION
THE BROKEN BATTALIONS WERE COMPARING NOTES OF NEWS AND IMPERTURBABLY
RENEWING THEIR SOCIAL LIFE BRIGADIERGENERAL TREFUSIS SLIPS OR
WADES THROUGH RAIN AND MUD TO LUNCH WITH HIS OLD BATTALION A FEW
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY AND ONE LEARNS INDIRECTLY WHAT CHEER AND COMFORT
HIS PRESENCE BRINGS THEN HE GOES ON WITH THE REMNANTS OF HIS
SHATTERED BRIGADE TO TAKE OVER FRESH WORK ON A QUIETER PART OF THE
LINE AND EN ROUTE TO GET HIS HAIR CUT

THE BATTALION AFTER SEPT 29 ANOTHER DAYS SOAKING IN VERMELLES
TRENCHES RELIEVED THE 3RD BRIGADE FIRST DIVISION IN FRONTLINE
TRENCHES JUST WEST OF HULLUCH

THE GROUND BY LE RUTOIRE FARM AND BOIS CARR BETWEEN THE BATTERED
GERMAN TRENCHES WAS A SEA OF SHELL CRATERS AND WRECKAGE SCORCHED
WITH FIRES OF EVERY SORT WHICH HAD SWEPT AWAY ALL LANDMARKS LONE
TREE A GENERAL RENDEZVOUS AND CLEARINGSTATION FOR THAT SECTOR OF
THE LINE AND A REGISTERED MARK FOR ENEMY GUNS WAS THE SPOT WHERE
THEIR GUIDES MET THEM IN THE RAINY WINDY DARKNESS THE RELIEF TOOK
FOUR HOURS AND COST DRILLSERGEANT CORRY ANOTHER NCO AND A
PRIVATE WOUNDED ALL FOUR COMPANY COMMANDERS WENT AHEAD SOME HOURS
BEFORE TO ACQUAINT THEMSELVES WITH THE IMPASSABLE TRENCHES THE
BATTALIONS BEING BROUGHT ON IN ARTILLERY FORMATION BY THE ADJUTANT

ON THE 30TH SEPTEMBER THE ENGLISH LOSSES HAVING BROUGHT OUR EFFORTS
TO A STANDSTILL THE TROOPS OF THE NINTH FRENCH ARMY CORPS BEGAN
TO TAKE OVER THE TRENCHES DEFENDING LOOS AND RUNNING OUT OF THE
RUINS OF THAT TOWN TO HILL 70 FOCH AND DUNTAL IN THEIR FIGHTING
SINCE THE 27TH HAD DRIVEN AT A PRICE THE GERMANS OUT OF SOUCHEZ
AND SOME DECEPTIVE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE BY THE TENTH FRENCH ARMY
CORPS UP THE VIMY HEIGHTS TO THE RIGHT OF THE ENGLISH LINE IN ALL
OUR ARMIES HAD MANUFACTURED A SALIENT SOME FIVE MILES WIDE ACROSS
THE BOW OF IT RUNNING FROM CUINCHY POST THE HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT
THE HULLUCH QUARRIES THE EDGE OF HILL 70 THE SOUTH OF LOOS AND
THENCE DOUBLING BACK TO GRENAY ON THE OTHER HAND THE ENEMY HAD
UNDERDRIVEN A SECTION SOUTH OF THIS AT THE JUNCTION OF THE ALLIED
FORCES RUNNING THROUGH LENS LIVIN ANGRES BY GIVENCHYENGOHELLE
OVER THE VIMY HEIGHTS TO THE SCARPE BELOW ARRAS THERE MAY EVEN ON
THE 30TH HAVE REMAINED SOME HOPE ON OUR PART OF BREAKING THROUGH
INTO THE PLAIN OF THE SCHELDT WITH ITS CHANCE OF OPEN WARFARE TO
FOLLOW THE ENEMY HOWEVER HAD NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING US ANY
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WHICH LOCALISED ATTACKS ON HIS PART COULD LIMIT
AND HOLD TILL SUCH TIME AS HIS RESERVES MIGHT GET IN A COUNTERATTACK
STRONG ENOUGH TO REGAIN ALL THE FEW POOR HUNDREDS OF YARDS WHICH WE
HAD SHELLED BOMBED AND BAYONETED OUT OF HIS FRONT THE FIGHTING WAS
SPECIALLY SEVERE THAT DAY AMONG THE RABBITWARRENS OF TRENCHES BY THE
HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT SECTIONS OF TRENCHES WERE LOST AND WON BACK OR
WIPED OUT BY GUNFIRE ALL ALONG A FRONT WHERE FOR ONE INSTANCE OF
RECORDED HEROISM AMONG THE CONFUSION OF BOMBS AND BARRICADES THERE
WERE HUNDREDS UNRECORDED AS THE SPOUTING EARTH CLOSED OVER AND HID
ALL AFTERKNOWLEDGE OF THE VERY SITE OF THE AGONY

A SECTION OF TRENCH HELD BY THE SCOTS FUSILIERS ON THE IMMEDIATE LEFT
OF THE IRISH GUARDS WAS ATTACKED AND A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO OF IT WERE
CAPTURED BUT THE BATTALION WAS NOT CALLED UPON TO LEND A HAND IT
LAY UNDER HEAVY SHELL AND SNIPING FIRE IN THE WET TILL IT WAS TIME
TO EXCHANGE THE COMPARATIVE SECURITY OF A WET OPEN DRAIN FOR THE
UNSHELTERED HORRORS OF A RELIEF WHICH BEGINNING IN THE DUSK AT SIX
WAS NOT COMPLETED TILL CLOSE ON TWO IN THE MORNING THE LAST COMPANY
REACHED THEIR MISERABLE BILLETS AT MAZINGARBE SOME THREE MILES AWAY
ACROSS A WELLSEARCHED BACKAREA AT 6 A M ONE NCO WAS KILLED AND
TEN NCOS AND MEN WERE WOUNDED

THEY SPENT THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN THE BATTERED SUBURBS OF MAZINGARBE
WHILE THE TWELFTH DIVISION TOOK OVER THE GUARDS LINE AND THE NINTH
FRENCH ARMY CORPS RELIEVED THE BRITISH TROOPS WHO WERE HOLDING THE
SOUTH FACE OF THE CUINCHYHULLUCHGRENAY SALIENT THE 1ST BATTALION
ITSELF WAS NOW DRAWN UPON TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE 2ND BATTALION
FOR OFFICERS TO MAKE GOOD LOSSES IN THEIR ACTION OF THE 27TH FIVE
OFFICERS AT LEAST WERE BADLY NEEDED BUT NO MORE THAN FOUR COULD
BE SPAREDCAPTAIN J S N FITZGERALD AS ADJUTANT LIEUTENANT R
RANKIN LIEUTENANT H MONTGOMERY WHO HAD ONLY ARRIVED WITH A DRAFT
ON THE 1ST OCTOBER AND 2ND LIEUTENANT LANGRISHE OFFICERS WERE A
SCARCE COMMODITY FOR THOUGH THERE WAS A MOMENTARY LULL THERE HAD
BEEN HEAVY BOMB AND TRENCH WORK BY THE TWENTYEIGHTH DIVISION ALL
ROUND THE DISPUTED HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT WHICH WAS FALLING PIECE BY
PIECE INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY AND COUNTERATTACKS WERE EXPECTED
ALL ALONG THE UNCERTAIN LINE


THE HOHENZOLLERN TRENCHES

ON OCTOBER 3 THE GUARDS DIVISION RELIEVED THE TWENTYEIGHTH ROUND
THE HOHENZOLLERN AND THE HULLUCH QUARRIES THE 3RD BRIGADE OF THE
DIVISION WAS ASSIGNED AS MUCH OF THE WORKS ROUND THE HOHENZOLLERN AS
YET REMAINED TO US THE 1ST BRIGADE LAY ON THEIR RIGHT LINKING ON TO
THE FIRST DIVISION WHICH HAD RELIEVED THE TWELFTH ON THE RIGHT OF THE
GUARDS DIVISION THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE WAS IN RESERVE AT VERMELLES
THE 1ST BATTALION ACTED AS RESERVE TO ITS OWN THE 1ST BRIGADE AND
MOVING FROM MAZINGARBE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 3RD BIVOUACKED IN
MISERY TO THE WEST OF THE RAILWAY LINE JUST OUTSIDE VERMELLES THE
2ND GRENADIERS IN TRENCHES WHICH HAD FORMED PART OF THE OLD BRITISH
FRONT LINE NORTHEAST OF THE CHAPEL OF NOTRE DAME DE CONSOLATION
SUPPORTED THE 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM WHO HELD THE FIRINGLINE IN A
MASS OF UNSURVEYED AND UNKNOWN GERMAN TRENCHES RUNNING FROM ST ELIE
AVENUE A NOTORIOUS AND MOST DISMAL COMMUNICATIONTRENCH NORTHWARDS
TOWARDS THE HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT ONE FACE OF WHICH GENEROUSLY
ENFILADED OUR LINE AT ALL TIMES THE WHOLE WAS A WILDERNESS OF MUCK
AND DEATH REACHED THROUGH THREE THOUSAND YARDS OF FOUL GUTTERS
IMPEDED BY LOOPS AND KNOTS OF OLD TELEPHONE CABLES WHOSE SIDES
BULGED IN THE WET AND WHERE WITH THE BEST CARE IN THE WORLD
RELIEFS COULD GO PITEOUSLY ASTRAY AND ISOLATED PARTIES FIND
THEMSELVES PLODDING BLIND AND HELPLESS INTO THE ENEMYS ARMS

OPINIONS NATURALLY DIFFER AS TO WHICH WAS THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE PERIOD
OF THE WAR FOR THE BATTALION BUT THERE WAS A GENERAL FEELING THAT
SETTING ASIDE THE CRUEL WET OF THE SALIENT AND THE COMPLICATED BARREN
MISERIES OF THE SOMME THE TIMES AFTER LOOS ROUND THE HOHENZOLLERN
REDOUBT AND IN THE LAVENTIE SECTOR WERE THE WORST MEN AND OFFICERS
HAD COUNTED ON GETTING FORWARD TO OPEN COUNTRY AT LAST AND THE
RETURN TO REDOUBLED TRENCHWORK AND ITS FATIGUES WAS NO COMFORT TO
THEM BUT THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE AND THE NOTICE IN THE DIARY THAT
THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPROVING AND CLEANING UP THE TRENCHES
AS FAR AS THE SUPPORT BATTALIONSWHICH MEANT AS FAR AS THEY COULD
GET FORWARDIMPLIED UNBROKEN LABOUR IN THE CHALKY GROUND VARIED BY
CARRYING UP SUPPLIES BOMBS AND SMALLARM AMMUNITION TO THE FRONT
LINE THERE WERE FIVE BOMBING POSTS IN THEIR SECTOR OF THE FRONT WITH
AS MANY SAPHEADS ALL TO BE GUARDED MOST OF THE TRENCHES NEEDED
DEEPENING AND ANY WORK IN THE OPEN WAS AT THE RISK OF A CONTINUOUS
STREAM OF BULLETS FROM THE HOHENZOLLERNS MACHINEGUNS HIGH
EXPLOSIVES AND A FEW GASSHELLS BY DAY AERIAL TORPEDOES BY NIGHT
AND SNIPING ALL ROUND THE CLOCK MADE THE ACCOMPANIMENT TO THEIR LIFE
FOR THE NINE DAYS THAT THEY HELD THE LINE

HERE IS THE BARE RECORD ON THE 6TH OCTOBER TWO MEN KILLED AND
THREE WOUNDED WHILE STRENGTHENING PARAPETS ON THE 7TH LIEUTENANT
HEARD AND THREE MEN WITH HIM WOUNDED WHILE SUPERINTENDING WORK IN
THE OPEN WITHIN RANGE OF THE SPITEFUL HOHENZOLLERN ON THE 8TH SIX
HOURS UNBROKEN BOMBARDMENT CULMINATING SO FAR AS THE BATTALION
KNEW IN AN ATTACK ON THE 2ND COLDSTREAM WHOM THEY WERE SUPPORTING
AND THE 3RD GRENADIERS ON THEIR LEFT THE GRENADIERS MOST OF THEIR
BOMBERS KILLED BORROWED NO 1 COMPANYS BOMBERS WHO DID GOOD
WORK WHILE NO 1 COMPANY ITSELF FORMED A FLANK TO DEFEND THE LEFT
OF THE BRIGADE IN CASE THE GERMANS BROKE THROUGH AS FOR A TIME
SEEMED POSSIBLE BOTH GRENADIERS AND COLDSTREAM RAN OUT OF BOMBS AND
AMMUNITION WHICH THE BATTALION SENT UP THROUGHOUT THE EVENING UNTIL
IT WAS REPORTED THAT ALL WAS NORMAL AGAIN AND THAT THE GERMANS
HAD EVERYWHERE BEEN REPULSED WITH HEAVY LOSS THE BATTALION THEN
CARRIED UP RATIONS TO THE COLDSTREAM AND SPENT THE REST OF THE NIGHT
REPAIRING BLOWNIN AMMUNITION TRENCHES THEY HAD HAD NO TIME TO
SPECULATE OR ASK QUESTIONS AND NOT TILL LONG AFTERWARDS DID THEY
REALISE THAT THE BLAST OF A GREAT BATTLE HAD PASSED OVER THEM THAT
THE GERMANS HAD COUNTERATTACKED WITH PICKED BATTALIONS ALL ALONG
THE LINE OF THE CUINCHYHULLUCHGRENAY SALIENT AND THAT THEIR DEAD
LAY IN THOUSANDS ON THE CUTUP GROUND FROM SOUCHEZ TO HOHENZOLLERN
IN MODERN TRENCHWARFARE ANY ATTACK EXTENDING BEYOND THE RANGE OF A
COMBATANTS VISION WHICH RUNS FROM FIFTY YARDS TO A QUARTER OF A
MILE ACCORDING TO THE GROUND AND HIS OWN PERSONAL DISTRACTIONS MAY
FOR AUGHT HE CAN TELL BE EITHER AN ENGAGEMENT OF THE FIRST CLASS OR
SOME LOCAL BRAWL FOR THE DETAILS OF WHICH HE CAN SEARCH NEXT WEEKS
HOME PAPERS IN VAIN

THE BATTALIONS GOT THROUGH THE DAY WITH ONLY SIX MEN KILLED ELEVEN
WOUNDED AND ONE GASSED AND ON THE 9TH WHEN THEY WERE BUSIEST IN
THE WORK OF REPAIRING WRECKED TRENCHES THEY WERE INFORMED THAT
CERTAIN RECESSES WHICH THEY HAD BEEN CUTTING OUT IN THE TRENCHES FOR
THE RECEPTION OF GASCYLINDERS WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED AND THAT THEY
WERE TO FILL THEM IN AGAIN AS A VETERAN OF FOUR YEARS EXPERIENCE
PUT IT APROPOS OF THIS AND SOME OTHER MATTERS MEN TAKE MORE
NOTICE YELL UNDERSTAND OF ONE EXTRA FATIGUE THAN ANY THREE
FIGHTS

A FEW AERIAL TORPEDOES WHICH WHETHER THEY KILL OR NOT MAKE
UNLIMITED MESS FELL DURING THE NIGHT AND ON THE MORNING OF THE 10TH
OCTOBER LIEUTENANT M V GORELANGTONONE OF THE BATTALIONS BEST
AND MOST EFFICIENT OFFICERSWAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD AND KILLED
BY A GERMAN SNIPER WHILE LOOKING FOR A POSITION FOR A LOOPHOLE IN
THE PARAPET HE WAS BURIED SIX HOURS LATER IN THE BRITISH CEMETERY
AT VERMELLES AND THE COMMAND OF HIS COMPANY DEVOLVED ON LIEUTENANT
YERBURGH OUR OWN ARTILLERY SPENT THE DAY IN BREAKING GERMAN WIRE
IN FRONT OF THE HULLUCH QUARRIES AT LONG RANGE AND A LITTLE MORE
THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OF OUR TRENCHES SEVERAL OF OUR SHELLS
DROPPED SHORT TO THE DISCOMFORT OF THE IRISH BUT THE WIRE WAS
SATISFACTORILY CUT AND TWO COMPANIES KEPT UP BURSTS OF RAPID FIRE
DURING THE NIGHT TO STAY THE ENEMY FROM REPAIRING IT ONLY 5 MEN WERE
KILLED AND 5 WOUNDED FROM ALL CAUSES THIS DAY

ON THE 11TH OUR GUNS RESUMED WIRECUTTING AND BESIDES MAKING IT MOST
UNPLEASANT FOR OUR MEN IN THE FRONT TRENCHES PUT ONE OF OUR OWN
MACHINEGUNS OUT OF ACTION BUT LUCKILY WITH NO LOSS OF LIFE

THE TRAGEDY OF THE DAY CAME LATER WHEN JUST AFTER LUNCH A SHELL
LANDED IN THE DOORWAY OF HEADQUARTERS DUGOUT BREAKING BOTH OF
COLONEL MADDENS LEGS AND MORTALLY WOUNDING THE REV FATHER JOHN
GWYNNE THE BATTALIONS RC CHAPLAIN COLONEL MADDEN DIED IN
ENGLAND A FEW WEEKS LATER THE ADJUTANT LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD
WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED ALSO THE OTHER TWO OCCUPANTS OF THE DUGOUT
CAPTAIN BAILIE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH ALMOST PRECISELY THE SAME
EXPERIENCE IN THE SAME SPOT NOT THREE DAYS BEFORE AND THE MEDICAL
OFFICER WERE UNTOUCHED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET TWO WOUNDED MEN DOWN
THE TRENCHES TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SUPPORTING BATTALION WHERE
THEY HAD TO BE LEFT TILL DARK AND THEN THEY WERE CARRIED BACK IN THE
OPENOR OVERLAND AS THE PHRASE WAS FATHER GWYNNE DIED NEXT DAY
IN HOSPITAL AT BTHUNE AND THE BATTALION LOST IN HIM NOT MERELY
THE CHAPLAIN BUT A MAN UNUSUALLY BELOVED HE HAD BEEN WITH THEM
SINCE NOVEMBER OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR HE FEARED NOTHING DESPISED NO
ONE BETRAYED NO CONFIDENCE NOR USED IT TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE UPHELD
AUTHORITY SOFTENED ASPERITIES AND CHEERED AND COMFORTED EVERY MAN
WITHIN HIS REACH IF THERE WERE ANY BLEMISH IN A CHARACTER SO UTTERLY
SELFLESS IT WAS NO MORE THAN A TENDENCY SHARED BY THE SERVANTS OF
HIS CALLING TO ATTACH MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
LAST RITES OF HIS CHURCH TO A WOUNDED MAN THAN TO THE IMMEDIATE
APPEARANCE OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER AND TO FORGET THAT THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN SUPREME UNCTION CAN BE A DEPRESSANT PER CONTRA ABSOLUTION
AT THE MOMENT OF GOING OVER THE TOP IF GIVEN WITH VIGOUR AND GOOD
CHEER AS HE GAVE IT IS A POWERFUL TONIC AT ALL TIMES THE PRIESTS
INFLUENCE IN CHECKING CRIME IN A REGIMENT IS VERY LARGE INDEED
AND WITH SUCH PRIESTS AS THE IRISH GUARDS HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO
POSSESS ALMOST UNBOUNDED

COLONEL MADDEN WAS SUCCEEDED BY CAPTAIN LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD AS
COMMANDING OFFICER AND THE REST OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN SUFFERING
A BOMBARDMENT OF AERIAL TORPEDOES VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE AND NOT
PUT DOWN BY OUR HEAVY GUNS TILL AFTER DARK BESIDES THE 3 WOUNDED
OFFICERS THAT DAY 3 MEN WERE WOUNDED AND 3 KILLED

ON THE MORNING OF THE 13TH AFTER HEAVY SHELLING A BOMB ATTACK ON
THE 2ND GRENADIERS DEVELOPED IN THE TRENCHES TO THE RIGHT WHEN THE
BATTALION BROUGHT UP AND DETONATED SEVERAL BOXES FOR THEIR COMRADES
THEIR WORK FURTHER INCLUDED PUTTING UP 120 SCALINGLADDERS FOR AN
ATTACK BY THE 35TH BRIGADE

NEXT DAY THEY WERE RELIEVED BY THE 7TH NORFOLKS 35TH BRIGADE OF THE
NORTH MIDLAND DIVISION OF TERRITORIALS AND WENT TO REST AT VERQUIN
FIVE OR SIX MILES BEHIND THE LINE IT TOOK THEM NEARLY SEVEN HOURS
TO CLEAR THE TRENCHES COLONEL MADDEN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WOUNDS
BEING CARRIED OUT ON A SITTING LITTER LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD WHO
AS ADJUTANT HAD BEEN WOUNDED WHEN FATHER GWYNNE HAD BEEN KILLED
OVERDUE FOR HOSPITAL WITH A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL IN HIS FOOT AND ALL
RANKS UTTERLY DONE AFTER THEIR NINE DAYS TURN OF DUTY THEY LAID
THEM DOWN AS TIRED ANIMALS LIE WHILE BEHIND THEM THE WHOLE NORTH
FRONT OF THE CUINCHYHULLUCH SALIENT BROKE INTO SET BATTLE ONCE AGAIN

A SERIES OF HOLDING ATTACKS WERE MADE ALL ALONG THE LINE ALMOST FROM
YPRES TO LA BASSE TO KEEP THE ENEMY FROM REINFORCING AGAINST THE
REAL ONE ON THE HOHENZOLLERN REDOUBT FOSSE 8 THE HULLUCH QUARRIES
AND THE HEART OF THE LOOS POSITION GENERALLY IT WAS PRECEDED
BY BOMBARDMENTS THAT IN SOME CASES CUT WIRE AND IN SOME DID NOT
ACCOMPANIED BY GAS AND SMOKE WHICH AFFECTED BOTH SIDES EQUALLY IT
WAS CARRIED THROUGH BY MEN IN SMOKEHELMETS HALFBLINDING THEM AMONG
BLINDING ACCOMPANIMENTS OF FUMES AND FLYING EARTH THROUGH TRENCHES
TO WHICH THERE WAS NO CLUE OVER THE WRECKS OF STREETS OF MINERS
COTTAGES CELLARS AND UNDERGROUND MACHINEGUN NESTS AND ROUND THE
CONCRETED FLANKS OF UNSUSPECTED ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS AMONG THESE
OBSTACLES TOO IT DIED OUT WITH THE DEAD BATTALIONS OF REGULARS AND
TERRITORIALS CAUGHT AS THE CHANCES OF WAR SMOTE THEM EITHER IN BULK
ACROSS OPEN GROUND OR IN DETAIL AMONG BOMBS AND MACHINEGUN POSTS

THERE WAS HERE AS MANY TIMES BEFORE AND VERY MANY TIMES AFTER
HEROISM BEYOND BELIEF AND EVERY FORM OF BRAVERY THAT THE SPIRIT
OF MAN CAN MAKE GOOD THE NET RESULT OF ALL BETWEEN THE 27TH OF
SEPTEMBER AND THE 15TH OF OCTOBER WHEN THE LAST GROUNDSWELL OF THE
LONG FIGHT SMOOTHED ITSELF OUT OVER THE UNBURIED DEAD WAS A LOSS TO
US OF 50000 MEN AND 2000 OFFICERS AND A GAIN OF A SALIENT SEVEN
THOUSAND YARDS LONG AND THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YARDS DEEP FOR
PRACTICAL PURPOSES A GOOD DEAL OF THIS DEPTH RANKED AS NO MANS
LAND FROM THAT DATE TILL THE FINAL BREAKUP OF THE GERMAN HOSTS IN
1918 THE PUBLIC WERE INFORMED THAT THE VALOUR OF THE NEW TERRITORIAL
DIVISIONS HAD JUSTIFIED THEIR TRAINING WHICH SEEMED EXPENSIVE AND
THAT OUR ARMIES WHATEVER ELSE THEY LACKED AT THAT TIMEAND IT WAS
NOT A LITTLEHAD GAINED IN CONFIDENCE WHICH SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS


AFTER LOOS

BUT THE BATTALION LAY AT VERQUIN CLEANING UP AFTER ITS TEN DAYS
FILTH AND THERE WAS MASS ON THE MORNING OF THE 14TH WHEN FATHER S
KNAPP CAME OVER FROM THE 2ND BATTALION AND SPOKE TO THE MEN ON THE
SUBJECT OF FATHER GWYNNES DEATH FOR NOW THAT THE TWO BATTALIONS
WERE NEXTDOOR NEIGHBOURS FATHER KNAPP SERVED BOTH NO WRITTEN
RECORD REMAINS OF THE PRIESTS SPEECH BUT THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT
HEARD IT SAY IT MOVED ALL MENS HEARTS MASS ALWAYS PRECEDED THE
DAYS WORK IN BILLETS BUT EVEN ON THE FIRST MORNING ON THEIR RETURN
FROM THE TRENCHES THE MEN WOULD MAKE SHIFT SOMEHOW TO CLEAN THEIR
HANDS AND FACES AND IF POSSIBLE TO SHAVE BEFORE ATTENDING IT NO
MATTER WHAT THE HOUR

THEN ON THE 14TH OCTOBER THEY MOVED FROM VERQUIN TO UNPLEASING
SAILLYLABOURSE FOUR MILES OR SO BEHIND THE LINE FOR ANOTHER DAYS
REST IN BILLETS AND SO OCT 17 TO WHAT WAS LEFT OF VERMELLES A
COUPLE OF MILES FROM THE FRONT WHERE THE MEN HAD TO MAKE THE WRECKED
HOUSES HABITABLE TILL OCT 19 THEY TOOK OVER FROM THE WELSH GUARDS
SOME RESERVETRENCHES ON THE OLD GROUND IN FRONT OF CLERKS KEEP A
QUARTER OF A MILE WEST OF THE VERMELLES RAILWAY LINE

THE 20TH OCTOBER WAS THE DAY WHEN THE 2ND BATTALION WERE ENGAGED IN
A BOMBING ATTACK ON THE HOHENZOLLERN FROM WHICH THEY WON NO SMALL
HONOUR AS WILL BE TOLD IN THEIR STORY THE 1ST BATTALION LAY AT
VERMELLES UNSHELLED FOR THE MOMENT AND HAD LEISURE TO MAKE LIGHT
OVERHEAD COVER FOR THE MEN AGAINST THE RAIN THE DIVISION WAS IN
LINE AGAIN AND THE BATTALIONS FIRST WORK WAS TO IMPROVE A NEW
LINE OF TRENCHES WHICH BESIDES THE DEFECT OF BEING MUCH TOO CLOSE
TO THE HOHENZOLLERN LACKED DUGOUTS IN LORD DESMOND FITZGERALDS
ABSENCE MAJOR THE HON H R ALEXANDER FROM THE 2ND BATTALION TOOK
COMMAND OF THE BATTALION AND THEY RELIEVED THE 2ND COLDSTREAM ON THE
21ST AND RESUMED THE STALE ROUTINEDIGGING SAPS UNDER FIRE WHICH
NECESSITATED SHOVELLING THE EARTH INTO SANDBAGS AND EMPTYING IT OUT
BY NIGHT DODGING SNIPERS AND TRENCHMORTARS AND HOPING THAT OUR
OWN SHELLS WHICH WERE BATTERING ROUND THE HOHENZOLLERN WOULD NOT
FALL TOO SHORT FIXING WIRE AND FUSES TILL THE MOON GREW AND THEY
HAD TO WAIT FOR THE DAWNMISTS TO CLOAK THEIR WORK DISCOVERING AND
RECONNOITRING OLD GERMAN COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES THAT RAN TO EVERNEW
GERMAN SNIPINGPOSTS AND HAD TO BE BLOCKED WITH WIRE TANGLES AND
LOSING IN THREE DAYS BY MINENWERFERS SNIPING THE FALL OF DUGOUTS
AND PREMATURE BURSTS OF OUR OWN SHELLS 7 MEN KILLED AND 18 WOUNDED
THE TWO COMPANIES 1 AND 2 WENT BACK TO VERMELLES WHILE 3 AND 4
TOOK OVER THE SUPPORTTRENCHES FROM THE 3RD COLDSTREAM REVERSING THE
PROCESS ON THE 24TH OCTOBER

WHEN LETTERS HINT AT DRILL IN ANY CONNECTION IT IS A SURE SIGN
THAT A BATTALION IS ON THE EVE OF RELIEF FOR EXAMPLE ON THE 24TH
2ND LIEUTENANT LEVY ARRIVED WITH A DRAFT OF FIFTYEIGHT MEN A
SERGEANT AND TWO CORPORALS WHO WERE DIVIDED AMONG THE COMPANIES
THE DIARY OBSERVES THAT THEY WERE A FAIR LOT OF MEN BUT DID NOT
LOOK TOO WELL DRILLED ACCORDINGLY AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MILD
SHELLING ROUND AND NEAR VERMELLES CHURCH AND SHRINE WE FIND THE
BATTALION RELIEVED BY THE NORFOLKS OCT 26 ALL FOUR COMPANIES
WORKED THEIR WAY CAUTIOUSLY OUT OF THE FIREZONEIT IS AT THE MOMENT
OF RELIEF THAT CASUALTIES ARE MOST FELTPICKED UP THEIR HEADQUARTERS
AND TRANSPORT AND MARCHED FOR HALF OF A WHOLE DAY IN THE OPEN TO
BILLETS AT PLEASANT WOODED LAPUGNOY WHERE THEY FOUND CLEAN STRAW
TO LIE DOWN ON AND WERE PROMISED BLANKETS AFTER THE USUAL CLEANUP
AND PAYMENT OF THE MEN THEY WERE ORDERED OFF TO CHOCQUES TO TAKE
PART IN THE KINGS REVIEW OF THE GUARDS DIVISION AT HAUTE RIZE ON
THE AFTERNOON OF THE 28TH BUT OWING TO THE ACCIDENT TO HIS MAJESTY
CAUSED BY THE HORSE FALLING WITH HIM THE PARADE WAS CANCELLED

STEADY DRILL FILLED THE NEXT TEN DAYS LIEUTENANT THE HON B
OBRIEN STARTED TO TRAIN FRESH BOMBINGSQUADS WITH THE MILLS BOMB
WHICH WAS THEN BEING ISSUED IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT AS MANY AS TWENTY
WHOLE BOXES COULD BE SPARED FOR INSTRUCTION UP TILL THEN BOMBS HAD
BEEN VARIED IN TYPE AND VARIOUS IN ACTION AS HAD BEEN POINTED OUT
THE IRISH TOOK KINDLY TO THIS GAME AND PRODUCED MANY NOTABLE EXPERTS
BUT THE PERFECT BOMBER IS NOT ALWAYS DOCILE OUT OF THE LINE AMONG
THE GIANTS OF 15 WAS A PRIVATE AGAINST WHOM ORDER HAD GONE FORTH
THAT ON NO ACCOUNT WAS HE TO BE PAID ON PAYDAYS FOR THE REASON THAT
ONCE IN FUNDS HE WOULD RETIRE INTO FRANCE AT LARGE FOR A DAY AND A
NIGHT AND A MORROW AND RETURN A HAPPY HICCUPING BUT INDISPENSABLE
CRIMINAL AT LAST AFTER A LONG STRETCH OF ENFORCED VIRTUE HE
MANAGED BY CHICANE OR HIS OWN AMAZING PERSONALITY TO SEDUCE FIVE
FRANCS FROM HIS PLATOON SERGEANT AND FORTHWITH DISAPPEARED ON HIS
RETURN RICHLY DISGUISED HE SOUGHT OUT HIS BENEFACTOR WITH A GIFT
UNDER HIS ARM THE REST IS IN HIS SERGEANTS OWN WORDS NO I
SAYS GO AWAY AND SLEEP IT OFF I SAYS PUSHIN IT AWAY FOR
TWAS A RUM JAR HE WAS TEMPTIN ME WITH TIS FOR YOU SERGEANT
HE SAYS YOURE THE ONLY MAN THAT HAS THRUSTED ME WITH A CENTIME

BATTALIONS AND HE WAS WORTH A PLATOON AN A HALF WHEN THERE WAS
ANYTHING DOING AND I THRUST IN GOD HES ALIVE YETHIM AND HIS FIVE
FRANCS BUT AN AWFUL MAN

DRUNKENNESS WAS CONFINED FOR THE MOST PART TO A KNOWN FEW
CHARACTERS REGULAR AND ALMOST PRIVILEGED IN THEIR IRREGULARITIES
THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRIEST AND THE WORK OF THE COMPANY OFFICERS
WENT HAND IN HAND HERE HERE IS A TRIBUTE PAID BY A BROTHER OFFICER
TO CAPTAIN GORELANGTON KILLED ON THE 10TH OCTOBER WHICH EXPLAINS
THE SECRET THE MEN LIKED HIM FOR HIS PLUCK AND THE PLAIN WAY IN
WHICH HE DEALT WITH THEM ALWAYS DOING HIS BEST FOR THE WORST MOST
IDLE AND STUPIDEST MEN IN OUR COMPANY ONE CANT REALLY BELIEVE
HES GONE I ALWAYS EXPECT TO SEE HIM SWINGING ROUND A TRAVERSE THE
BATTALION DID NOT FORGET HIM AND WHILE AT LAPUGNOY SENT A PARTY TO
VERMELLES TO ATTEND TO HIS GRAVE THERE

ON THE 31ST OCTOBER LIEUTCOLONEL R C MCCALMONT ARRIVED FROM
COMMANDING A BATTALION OF THE NEW ULSTER ARMY DIVISION AND TOOK OVER
THE COMMAND FROM MAJOR ALEXANDER WHO REVERTED TO THE 2ND BATTALION
FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORROWED


LAVENTIE

ON THE 10TH OF THE MONTH THE GUARDS DIVISION WERE FOR DUTY AGAIN
ON THE LAVENTIE SECTOR WHICH AT EVERY TIME OF THE YEAR HAD A
BAD REPUTATION FOR WET THE OUTCOME OF LOOS HAD ENDED HOPE OF A
BREAKTHROUGH AND A FEW THOUSAND YARDS WON THERE AGAINST A FEW
THOUSAND LOST OUT YPRES WAY REPRESENTED THE BALANCE OF THE ACCOUNT
SINCE NOVEMBER 1914 THEREFORE ONCE AGAIN THE LINE HAD TO BE HELD
TILL MORE MEN MUNITIONS AND MATERIALS COULD BE TRAINED MANUFACTURED
AND ACCUMULATED WHILE THE PRICE OF MAKING WAR ON THE SPUR OF THE
MOMENT WAS PAID DAY IN AND DAY OUT WITH THE BODIES OF YOUNG MEN
SUBJECT TO EVERY FORM OF DEATH AMONG THE SLITS IN THE DIRT ALONG
WHICH THEY MOVED IT BORED THEM EXTREMELY BUT OTHERWISE DID NOT
MUCH AFFECT THEIR MORALE THEY BUILT SOME SORT OF DECENT LIFE OUT OF
THE MONOTONOUS HOURS THEY CAME TO KNOW THE VERY BEST AND THE VERY
WORST IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR COMRADES UPON WHOM THEIR LIVES AND
WELLBEING DEPENDED AND THEY FORMED FRIENDSHIPS THAT LASTED AS
FATE WILLED FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS THEY LIED PERSISTENTLY AND
WITH INTENT IN THEIR HOME LETTERS CONCERNING THEIR DISCOMFORTS AND
EXPOSURE AND LENT THEMSELVES TO THE IMPRESSION CULTIVATED BY SOME
SEDULOUS NEWSPAPERS THAT THE TRENCHES WERE ELECTRICALLYLIGHTED
ABODES OF COMFORT AND JOLLITY VARIED WITH CONCERTS AND SPORTS IT
WAS ALL PART OF THE TRIAL WHICH THE NATIONAL GENIUS CALLS THE GAME

THE BATTALION LIEUTCOLONEL R C MCCALMONT COMMANDING WAS AT
PACAUT DUE NORTH OF BTHUNE ON THE 11TH AT MERVILLE ON THE 14TH
TRAINING YOUNG SOLDIERS HOW TO USE SMOKEHELMETSFOR GAS WAS
A THING TO BE EXPECTED ANYWHERE NOWAND ENJOYING EVERY VARIETY
OF WEATHER FROM SODDEN WET TO SHARP FROST THE EFFECTS OF THE
GASHELMET ON THE YOUNG SOLDIERS WERE QUAINTLY DESCRIBED AS VERY
USEFUL ON THEM TWAS LIKE THROWIN A CLOTH OVER A PARROTCAGE IT
STOPPED ALL THEIR CHAT

ON THE 20TH NOVEMBER THEY TOOK OVER RESERVEBILLETS FROM THE 1ST
SCOTS GUARDS NEAR BOUT DEVILLE AND THE NEXT DAY AFTER INSPECTION
OF BOTH BATTALIONS BY GENERAL FEILDING COMMANDING THE DIVISION
AND THE LATE MR JOHN REDMOND MP WENT INTO TRENCHES WITH THE
HAPPY FOREKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WERE LIKELY TO STAY THERE TILL THE
2ND OF JANUARY AND WOULD BE LUCKY IF THEY GOT A FEW DAYS OUT AT
CHRISTMAS IT WAS A STRETCH OF UNMITIGATED BEASTLINESS IN THE LOW
DITCHRIDDLED GROUND BEHIND NEUVE CHAPELLE AND THE AUBERS RIDGE
ON THE INTERMINABLE LA BASSEESTAIRES ROAD WITH NO AVAILABLE
COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES IN MANY PLACES IMPASSABLE FROM WET ALL
NEEDING SANDBAGS AND ALL IN A VERY NEGLECTED STATE EXCEPT FOR THE
WORK DONE BY THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE THE WEEK BEFORE THE BATTALION
MOVED IN IT IS NOWHERE ON RECORD THAT THE GUARDS DIVISION OR
FOR THAT MATTER ANY OTHER WAS EVER CONTENTED WITH TRENCHES THAT
IT TOOK OVER THE ENEMY HOWEVER WERE QUIET BEING AT LEAST AS
UNCOMFORTABLE AS OUR PEOPLE EVEN WHEN OUR FIELDGUNS BLEW LARGE
GAPS IN THEIR PARAPETS A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
RETALIATION AND OUR CASUALTIES ON RELIEFTHE MEN LAY IN SCATTERED
BILLETS AT RIEZ BAILLEUL THREE MILES OR SO UP THE ROADWERE
RELATIVELY FEW

IN ONE WHOLE WEEK NOT MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE MEN WERE KILLED AND
FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN WOUNDED TWO OF THEM BY OUR OWN SHRAPNEL BURSTING
SHORT WHILE OUR GUNS EXPERIMENTED ON BLOCKHOUSES AND STEEL CUPOLAS
AS THESE REVEALED THEMSELVES EVEN WHEN THE PRINCE OF WALES VISITED
THE LINE AT THE MAJORGENERALS INSPECTION OF IT AND LEFT BY THE
ONLY POSSIBLE ROAD SIGN POST LANE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THE OPEN
WITHIN A FURLONG OF THE ENEMY CASUALTIES DID NOT OCCUR THERE
IS NO MENTION EITHER OF ANY OF THE AEROPLANEVISITATIONS WHICH
SOMETIMES FOLLOWED HIS APPEARANCES AS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF ONE OF
THE OFFICERS HE FOUND REASON TO VISIT ALONG THAT SECTOR MORE OFTEN
THAN IS OFFICIALLY RECORDED

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE WAS RELIEVED
BY THE 3RD OF ITS DIVISION AND THE BATTALION HANDED ITS LINE
OVER TO THE 4TH GRENADIERS NOT WITHOUT SOME HOUSEWIFELY PRIDE AT
IMPROVEMENTS IT HAD EFFECTED BUT SINCE PRIDE EVER PRECEDES A FALL
THE SHARP FROST OF THE PAST WEEK DISSOLVED IN HEAVY RAIN AND THE
NEAT NEWMADE BREASTWORKS WITH THEIR ALIGNED SANDBAGS COLLAPSED IF
THE 4TH GRENADIERS KEEP VERACIOUS DIARIES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THAT
NIGHT OF THAW AND DELAYED RELIEFS IS STRONGLY RECORDED IN THEM

LA GORGUE UNDER ESTAIRES UPON THE SLUGGISH LYS IN SODDEN WET
WEATHER DECEMBER 38 GAVE THEM A BREATHING SPACE FOR A GENERAL
WASHUP AND THOSE STEADY DRILLS NECESSARY TO MANKIND THE NEW
STRETCH THAT THEY TOOK OVER FROM THEIR OWN 2ND BATTALION WAS ABOUT
TWO MILES NORTH OF THEIR PREVIOUS ONE AND SOUTHEAST OF LAVENTIE
RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE RUE TILLELOY THAT ENDLESS ROAD FLANKED
LIKE ALL OTHERS HEREABOUTS WITH FARMHOUSES WHICH JOINS ARMENTIRES
TO NEUVE CHAPELLE THE GROUND WAS OF COURSE SOP THE PARAPETS WERE
PERFORABLE BREASTWORKS BUT RELIEFS COULD ARRIVE UNOBSERVED WITHIN
FIVE HUNDRED YARDS OF THE FRONT AND THE ENEMYS LINE LAY IN MOST
PLACES NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM OURS MORE IMPORTANT STILL
THERE WAS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR BATTALION HEADQUARTERS IN A
FARMHOUSE ONE OF THE MANY RED HOUSES OF THE WAR WHICH BY SOME
ACCIDENT HAD BEEN UNTOUCHED SO FAR THOUGH IT STOOD LESS THAN A MILE
FROM THE FRONT LINE WHERE HEADQUARTERS ARE COMFORTABLE HEADQUARTERS
ARE HAPPY AND BY SO MUCH THE MORE PLACABLE ONLY VERY YOUNG SOLDIERS
GRUDGE THEM PROTECTION AND WARMTH

FOR A FEW DAYS IT WAS A PEACEFUL STRETCH OF THE GREAT LINE THAT
BUTTRESSED ON SWITZERLAND AND THE SEA CHRISTMAS WAS COMING AND
EVEN HAD THE WEATHER ALLOWED IT NEITHER SIDE WAS LOOKING TOO
EARNESTLY FOR TROUBLE

A COMPANY OF WELSH FUSILIERS WITH THEIR CO AND ADJUTANT CAME UP FOR
EIGHT DAYS INSTRUCTION AND WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE BATTALION
THE SYSTEM IN THE FRONT LINE AT THAT MOMENT WAS ONE OF GANGS OF
THREE A DIGGER AN ARMED MAN AND A BOMBER RELIEVING EACH OTHER BY
SHIFTS AND TO EACH OF THESE TRIOS ONE WELSHMAN WAS ALLOTTED

THE WELSH WERE SMALL KEEN AND INQUISITIVE THE LARGE IRISH PRAISED
THEIR SAINTS ALOUD FOR SENDING THEM NEW BOYS TO TALK TO THROUGH THE
LONG WATCHES IT IS RELATED OF ONE WELSHMAN THAT AMONG A THOUSAND
QUESTIONS HE DEMANDED IF HIS TUTOR HAD EVER GONE OVER THE TOP THE
IRISHMAN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD AND HOW OFTEN DOES ONE GO OVER
THE WELSHMAN CONTINUED ILL SHOW YOU COME WITH ME REPLIED
THE OTHER CELT AND MOVING TO A GAP IN THE PARAPET LIFTED THE
WELSHMAN IN HIS ARMS THAT HE MIGHT THE BETTER SEE WHAT REMAINED
HUNG UP IN GERMAN WIRE OF A PRIVATE OF SOME ANCIENT FIGHTWITHERED
WRECKAGE PERHAPS OF NEUVE CHAPELLE HE WENT OVER WANST SAID
THE IRISHMAN THE WORKINGPARTY RESUMED THEIR LABOURS AND MEN SAY
THAT THAT NEW BOY PUT NO MORE QUESTIONS FOR THE FULL OF THE HALF AN
HOURAN THATS AS LONG AS A WEEK TO A WELSHMAN

ALL FOUR COMPANIES WERE HELD IN THE FIRST LINE EXCEPT FOR THREE
POSTSPICANTIN DEAD END AND HOUGOUMONTA FEW HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
THAT WERE MANNED WITH A PLATOON APIECE BUT ON THE 12TH DECEMBER
RUMOURS OF A MINE MADE IT WISE TO EVACUATE A PART OF THE RIGHT
FLANK TILL ONE OF OUR 92S SHOULD HAVE SEARCHED FOR THE SUSPECTED
MINESHAFT ITS INVESTIGATIONS ROUSED THE ENEMY TO MILD RETALIATION
WHICH ENDED NEXT DAY IN ONE OF OUR MEN BEING WOUNDED BY OUR OWN 92
AND THREE BY THE ENEMYS SHRAPNELTHE FIRST CASUALTIES IN FOUR DAYS

THE WET KEPT THE PEACE ALONG THE LINE BUT IT DID NOT ALTOGETHER DAMP
THE ENERGIES OF OUR PATROLS FOR A REASON NOT EXPLAINED OFFICIALLY
LIEUTENANT S E F CHRISTY WAS MOVED TO GO OUT WITH A PATROL
AND TO HURL INTO THE GERMAN LINES A PRINTED MESSAGE WAS IT THE
EARLIEST WORKINGS OF PROPAGANDA DEMANDING THAT THE GERMANS SHOULD
SURRENDER THERE IS NO INDICATION WHETHER THE SUMMONS WAS TO THE
GERMAN ARMY AT LARGE OR MERELY TO AS MANY OF THEM AS LAY BEFORE THE
BATTALION BUT THE INVITATION BEING DISREGARDED LIEUTENANTS CHRISTY
AND LAW MADE THEMSELVES OFFENSIVE IN PATROLWORK TO THE BEST OF THEIR
MEANS ON ONE EXCURSION THE LATTER OFFICER DISCOVERED DECEMBER 15
A WATERLOGGED CONCRETEBUILT LOOPHOLE DUGOUT OCCUPIED BY GERMANS
BEING A HARDENED SOUVENIRHUNTER HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE REMOVED THE
OFFICIAL GERMAN NAMEBOARD OF THE ESTABLISHMENT ERE HE WENT BACK FOR
REINFORCEMENTS WITH A VIEW OF CAPTURING IT COMPLETE ON HIS RETURN
HE FOUND IT ABANDONED THE WATER HAD DRIVEN THE ENEMY TO A DRIER
POST AND THE CUTTINGOUT EXPEDITION HAD TO BE POSTPONED TOO LONG
IN THE LINE WITHOUT INCIDENT WEARS ON EVERY ONES TEMPER BUT LUCK
WAS AGAINST THEM AND AN ATTEMPT ON THE 20TH DECEMBER BY A SELECTED
PARTY UNDER SOME RES AND LIEUTENANTS LAW AND CHRISTY WAS RUINED
BY THE MOONLIGHT AND THE FACT THAT THE ENEMY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR
CONCRETE HUTCH AND WERE MORE THAN ON THE ALERT BY THE LIGHT OF LATER
KNOWLEDGE THE BATTALION WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE DUGOUT HAD
BEEN LEFT AS BAIT AND THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY SPIES IN OUR LINES
BEFORE LAVENTIE

ON THE 21ST DECEMBER THE BATTALION CAME OUT FOR CHRISTMAS AND
BILLETED AT LAVENTIE AS THEIR NEXT TURN WOULD BE IN THE OLD SECTOR
THAT THEY HAD HANDED OVER TO THE 4TH GRENADIERS THREE WEEKS AGO THE
SAME BATTALION RELIEVED THEM ON THIS DAY AND AS BEFORE WERE AN
HOUR LATE IN TURNING UPA THING INEXCUSABLE EXCEPT ON ONES OWN PART

THEIR ADJUTANTS PREOCCUPATIONS WITH OFFICERS SICK AND WOUNDED
NCOS PROMOTED TO COMMISSIONS IN LINE BATTALIONS AND THE CATCHING
AND TRAINING OF THEIR SUBSTITUTES AND WITH ALL THE HOUSEKEEPING
WORK OF A BATTALION IN THE FIELD HAD NOT PREVENTED HIM FROM MAKING
STRICT AND ACCURATE INQUIRIES AT HEADQUARTERS AS TO WHAT EXACTLY IS
BEING SENT OUT FOR CHRISTMAS DAY IS IT PLUMPUDDING ONLY OR SAUSAGES
ALONE LAST YEAR WE HAD BOTH BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN

ALL THINGS CONSIDERED AND THERE WAS NO SHELLING CHRISTMAS DINNER
AT LA GORGUE 1915 WAS A SUCCESS AND THE CO AND OTHER OFFICERS
WENT ROUND THE DINNERS AS AT HOME IN MERCIFUL IGNORANCE THAT THOSE
OF THEM WHO SURVIVED WOULD ATTEND THREE MORE SUCH FESTIVALS

MAJORGENERAL LORD CAVAN COMMANDING THE GUARDS DIVISION WHO HAD
BEEN APPOINTED TO COMMAND THE NEWLY FORMED FOURTEENTH CORPS7
ADDRESSED THE OFFICERS AFTER DINNER AND HALFPROMISED THEM THE
CHRISTMAS PRESENT THEY MOST DESIRED HE SPOKE WELL OF THE BATTALION
AS ONE WHO HAD SEEN AND SHARED THEIR WORK HAD RIGHT TO DO SAYING
THAT THERE MIGHT BE AS GOOD BUT THERE WERE NONE BETTER AND ADDED
THAT THERE WAS JUST A HOPE THAT THE GUARDS DIVISION MIGHT EVENTUALLY
GO TO HIS CORPS THEY CHEERED

THE QUIET THAT FELL ABOUT CHRISTMASTIDE HELD TILL THE BIRTH OF THE
NEW YEAR WHICH THE INSCRUTABLE HUN MIND CELEBRATED PUNCTUALLY ON
THE HOUR GERMAN TIME WITH TWENTY MINUTES HEAVY MACHINEGUN AND
RIFLEFIRE IN THE DARKNESS ONE KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED WERE ALL THEIR
CASUALTIES

HERE IS THE ROLL OF THE OFFICERS AND STAFF OF THE BATTALION AS THE
YEAR ENDED IN MUD AMONG ROTTEN PARAPETS AND WATERLOGGED TRENCHES
WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR ALL THAT HAD GONE BEFORE SAVE TIME GAINED
AND GROUND HELD TO ALLOW OF PREPARATION FOR THE REAL STRUGGLE ON
THE EDGE OF WHICH THESE THOUSAND SOLDIERS AND ALL THEIR WORLD STOOD
IGNORANT BUT UNSHAKEN

THE SALIENT TO THE SOMME


BRIGADIERGENERAL G FEILDING DSO AS WE KNOW SUCCEEDED LORD
CAVAN IN THE COMMAND OF THE GUARDS DIVISION AND THE ENEMY WOKE UP
TO A LITTLE MORE REGULAR SHELLING AND SNIPING FOR A FEW DAYS TILL
JANUARY 4 THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY RELIEVED BY A
FRESH BRIGADE THE 114TH AND THE BATTALION MOVED TO BILLETS IN ST
FLORIS WHICH AS USUAL WERE IN A VERY FILTHY CONDITION THERE THEY
STAYED UNDER STRONG TRAINING AT BOMBING AND LEWIS GUNNERY TILL
THE 12TH THENCE TO MERVILLE TILL THE 23RD WHEN LIEUTENANT HON H
B OBRIEN A SPECIALIST IN THESE MATTERS AS MAY HAVE BEEN NOTICED
BEFORE WAS APPOINTED BRIGADE BOMBING OFFICER THE BOMB WAS TO BE THE
DOMINANT FACTOR OF THE DAYS WORK FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR SO AND THE
NUMBER OF STUDENTS MADE THE COUNTRY ROUND BILLETS UNWHOLESOME AND
VARIED THERE IS A TRUE TALE OF A BOMBING SCHOOL ON A FOGGY MORNING
WHO HURLING WITH ZEAL OVER A BANK INTO THE MIST FOUND THEMSELVES
PRESENTLY BEING CURSED FROM A SAFE DISTANCE BY A REPAIRING PARTY
WHO HAD BEEN SENT OUT TO DISCOVER WHY ONE WHOLE SYSTEM OF BIGGUN
TELEPHONEWIRES WAS DUMB THEY COMPLAINED THAT THE SCHOOL HAD CUT IT
INTO VERMICELLI

THE INSTRUCTION BORE FRUIT FOR SO SOON AS THEY WERE BACK IN THE
TRENCHES AT EBENEZER FARM WHICH THEY HAD QUITTED ON THE 4TH BOMBING
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORCED WHEREVER PRACTICABLE A WEAK OR IT MIGHT
BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY A SORE POINT HAD DEVELOPED ON THE FRONT IN
A CRATER THROWN UP BY ONE OF OUR OWN MINES WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY
TO SAP OUT TO AND PROTECT BY INTERMITTENT BOMBING THIS BROUGHT
RETALIATION AND A FEW CASUALTIES NIGHTLY A TRENCHMORTAR BATTERY
WAS IMPORTED TO DEAL WITH THE NUISANCE AND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED
DREW THE ENEMYS ARTILLERY

ON THE 28TH JANUARY A SINGLE STRAY BULLET IN THE DARK FOUND AND
KILLED CAPTAIN V C J BLAKE NO 2 COMPANY WHILE HE WAS LAYING OUT
SOME WORK IN WIRE FOR HIS COMPANY AND A BOMBING ATTACK ROUND THE
MINECRATER ENDED IN THREE OTHER RANKS KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED

ON FEBRUARY 1 OUR MINESHAFT IN THE SAME LOCALITY FLOODED WITHOUT
WARNING AND DROWNED A COUPLE OF MEN IN A LISTENINGPOST OUR PUMPS
COULD MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON THE WATER IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PUT UP
ANY HEADCOVER FOR THE MEN IN THE FORWARD SAP AND THE ENEMYS WIRE
WAS BEING STRENGTHENED NIGHTLY AND NEEDED CLEARING AWAY THIS WAS
ROUTINEWORK UNDERTAKEN BY OUR ARTILLERY WHO BLEW GAPS IN IT IN THREE
PLACES WHICH THE BATTALION COVERED WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE IT KEPT
THE ENEMY REASONABLY QUIET AND HRH PRINCE ALBERT WHO WAS OUT ON
A TOUR FROM ENGLAND BREAKFASTED WITH BATTALION HEADQUARTERS THE SAME
MORNING FEBRUARY 5 ONCE AGAIN THE ENEMYS INFORMATION MUST HAVE
BEEN INACCURATE OR DELAYED SINCE THERE IS NO MENTION OF ANY SHELLING
OR AEROPLANE WORK ON HEADQUARTERS

THEY CAME OUT OF THE LINE ON THE 7TH AND BILLETED NEAR MERVILLE
RECKONED BY THEIR STANDARDS IT HAD BEEN AN UNEVENTFUL STRETCH OF
DUTY AND THOSE OFFICERS WHO COULD BE SPARED HAD GONE ON SHORT LEAVE
FOR THERE WAS A RUMOUR THAT LEAVE WOULD BE STOPPED AFTER THE 20TH OF
THE MONTH THE FRENCH AND THEIR ENGLISH ALLIES KNEW WELL THAT THE
GREAT GERMAN ATTACK ON VERDUN WAS RIPENING IT OPENED IN THE THIRD
WEEK OF FEBRUARY AND THE WORLD HAD NO DOUBT OF THE ISSUES THAT
DEPENDED UPON THAT GATE TO THE HEART OF FRANCE HOLDING FAST THE
WHOLE LONG LINE STIFFENED TO TAKE THE WEIGHT OF ANY SUDDEN SIDEISSUE
OR MAIN CATASTROPHE THAT THE CHANCE OF WAR MIGHT BRING ABOUT BUT A
BATTALION AMONG HUNDREDS OF BATTALIONS KNOWS AS LITTLE WHAT ITS OWN
MOVEMENTS MEAN AS A SINGLE TRUCK IN A GOODS YARD KNOWS OF THE IMPORT
AND EXPORT TRADE OF GREAT BRITAIN THE YOUNG OFFICERS SNATCHED THEIR
FEW HOURS LEAVE AT HOME LOYALLY TOLD THEIR PEOPLE THAT ALL WAS
GOING WELL RETURNEDTO A MOST INTERESTING LECTURE ON THE BATTLE
OF NEUVE CHAPELLE DELIVERED AT LA GORGUE BY A DIVISIONAL STAFF
OFFICER AND TO AN INSPECTION OF THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE BY LORD
KITCHENER ON A VILE WET DAY WHEN THEY WERE ALL SOAKED TO THE SKIN
FEBRUARY 10 AND TO THE USUAL ROUTINE IN VERY POOR WEATHER

LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD BEING NOW SECOND IN COMMAND BY SENIORITY
RESIGNED HIS ADJUTANCY AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY LIEUTENANT T E G
NUGENT NO 2 CAPTAIN BLAKES COMPANY WAS COMMANDED BY MAJOR THE
HON A C S CHICHESTER FRESH FROM HOME AND FATHER S KNAPP
THEIR PRIEST WHO HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE 1ST LONDON IRISH
WAS FOLLOWED BY FATHER J LANEFOX FROM THE SAME BATTALION OF THE
SIX FATHERS WHO SERVED THE TWO BATTALIONS TWOFATHERS GWYNNE AND
S KNAPP DSO MCWERE KILLED ONEFATHER F M BROWNE
MCWOUNDED TWICE AND ONEFATHER F S BROWNE MCWOUNDED ONCE

ON THE FACE OF IT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN QUIETER AND MORE DOMESTIC
THAN THEIR DAILY LIFE ROUND MERVILLE AND AFTER A WEEK OF IT THEY
WERE MOVED FEBRUARY 16 NORTH TOWARDS STEENVOORDE IN A HURRICANE
OF WIND AND RAIN TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF POPERINGHE ON THE
YPRESPOPERINGHEDUNKIRK ROAD AND A CAMP OF TENTS MOSTLY BLOWN
DOWN AND HUTS CONNECTED FOR WHICH SMALL EASE THEY WERE GRATEFUL
BY DUCKBOARDS THIS BROUGHT THEM INTO THE SECOND ARMY AREA AND INTO
THE FOURTEENTH CORPS UNDER LORD CAVAN PRECISELY AS THAT OFFICER HAD
HOPED HE EXPLAINED TO THEM THERE WAS A SMALL GERMAN OFFENSIVE ON
THE LEFT OF THE LINE HERE AND THAT IF IT CAME TO ANYTHING THE
BRIGADE MIGHT BE WANTED

THE SMALL OFFENSIVE HAD OPENED ON THE 13TH WITH A FURIOUS
BOMBARDMENT OF THE EXTREME SOUTHERN END OF THE YPRES SALIENT BETWEEN
THE YPRESCOMINES CANAL AND YPRESCOMINES RAILWAY A LITTLE TO THE
SOUTH OF HILL 60 FOLLOWED BY THE SPRINGING OF FIVE MINES UNDER
THE BRITISH FRONT LINE AND AN INFANTRY ATTACK WHICH ENDED IN THE
CAPTURE BY THE ENEMY OF FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED YARDS OF TRENCH AND
THE LOW RIDGE CALLED THE BLUFF OVER WHICH THEY RAN THE AFFAIR
BULKED BIG IN THE NEWSPAPERPRESS OF THE DAY FOR A BATTALION
THE 10TH LANCASHIRE FUSILIERS WAS LITERALLY BURIED BY ONE OF THE
MINE EXPLOSIONS THE GERMAN GAIN WAS WELL HELD BUT PREVENTED FROM
EXTENDING BY A CONCENTRATION OF OUR ARTILLERY AND LATER ON MARCH 2
THE WHOLE POSITION WAS RECAPTURED AFTER DESPERATE FIGHTING AND THE
LINE THERE CAME TO REST

FOR THE FIRST TIME THE BATTALION SEEMS IMPRESSED BY THE HOSTILE
AIRCRAFT WITH WHICH THE SALIENT WAS FILLED POPERINGHE AND HAZEBROUCK
WERE BOMBED ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY CAME IN AND THEIR CAMP WAS
VISITED BY FOUR AEROPLANES AT HIGH NOON AFTER A SNOWFALL WHICH
SHOWED UP EVERYTHING BELOW THEY HAD BEEN ATTENDING A DEMONSTRATION
TO PROVE THE HARMLESSNESS OF A FLAMMENWERFER IF ONLY ONE LAY FLAT
ON THE GROUND AND LET THE ROARING BLAST HISS OVER RIBALD MEN HAVE
EXPLAINED SINCE THAT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE MORE DEMORALISING
THAN THE ACTUAL MACHINE IN ACTION ESPECIALLY WHEN AS OCCASIONALLY
HAPPENED THE NOZZLE OF THE FLAMESHOOTER CARRIED AWAY AND IN THE
ATTEMPTS TO RECONTROL THE THING THE CLASS BOMBED FROM ABOVE AND
CHASED BY FIRE BELOW BROKE AND FLED

BUT THE WHOLE SALIENT WAS A DEATHTRAP THROUGHOUT THE GREAT SHELLS
CROSSED EACH OTHERS PATH AT EVERY ANGLE BACK AND FORTH SINGLE
OR IN FLIGHTS FOR NO CERTAIN CAUSE THAT OUR SIDE COULD GUESS
FIRE WOULD CONCENTRATE ITSELF ON SOME HALFOBLITERATED FEATURE OF
THE LANDSCAPEA BANK THE POOR STUMPAGE OF A WOOD A REMNANT OF A
VILLAGE OR THE ANGLE OF A ROAD THAT WENT OUT IN SMOKE DUST AND
FLYING CLODS AS THOUGH DEVILS WERE FLINGING IT UP WITH INVISIBLE
SPADES THE CONCENTRATED CLAMOURS WOULD DIE DOWN AND CEASE THE
SINGLE SHELLS WOULD RESUME THEIR AIMLESS FALLING OVER A LINE OF
FIELDS WITH THE MONOTONY OF DRIPS FROM A TAP TILL AGAIN IT SEEMED
AS THOUGH ONE OF THEM HAD FOUND SOMETHING WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND
SHOUTED BACK THE NEWS TO ITS FELLOWS WHO CROWDING ALTOGETHER IN ONE
SPOT ROARED OVERTURNED AND SET ALIGHT FOR FIVE OR TEN WILD MINUTES
OR THROUGH A METHODICAL HALFHOUR IF THE STORM FELL ON BARE GROUND
THAT WAS CHURNED AND TORN AFRESH INTO SMOKING CLODS IF UPON MEN IN
TRENCHES ON RELIEF OR WITH THE TRANSPORT NO EYE COULD JUDGE WHAT
HARM HAD BEEN DONE FOR OFTEN WHERE IT HAD SEEMED AS THOUGH NOTHING
COULD LIVE DISPERSED UNITS PICKED THEMSELVES UP AND REFORMED ALMOST
UNTOUCHED AFTER INCONCEIVABLE ESCAPES ELSEWHERE A FEW SPURTS OF
STINKING SMOKE IN A CORNER MIGHT COVER ALL THAT REMAINED OF A PLATOON
OR HAVE RIPPED THE HEART OUT OF A SILENT WAITING COMPANY BY NIGHT
FANTASTIC TRACERIES OF CROSSING FIRELINES RAN ALONG THE SHOULDER OF
A RIDGE SHRAPNEL BURSTING HIGH JETTED A TRAIL OF SWIFT SPARKS
AS IT MIGHT BE STEEL STRIKING FLINT DROPPING FLARES OUTLINED SOME
TORTURED FARMHOUSE AMONG ITS WILLOWSTUMPS OR THE INTOLERABLE GLARE
OF A BIG SHELL FRAMED ITSELF BEHIND A NAKED DOORWAY AND COLOURED
LIGHTS DYED THE BELLIES OF THE LOW CLOUDS TILL ALL SENSE OF DISTANCE
AND DIRECTION WAS LOST AND THE BEWILDERED TROOPS STUMBLED AND
CRAWLED FROM PAV TO POTHOLE TREADING UPON THE OLD DEAD

DAWN BROUGHT DIRTY WHITE DESOLATION ACROSS YELLOW MUD PITTED WITH
SLATECOLOURED WATERHOLES AND CONFUSED BY SENSELESS GREY AND
BLACK LINES AND CURLED TANGLES OF MIRE THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE
EXCEPTALMOST PEARLCOLOURED UNDER THEIR MUDDYED HELMETSTHE
TENSE PREOCCUPIED FACES OF MEN MOVING WITH WIDE SPACES BETWEEN THEIR
PLATOONS TO WATERFLOORED CELLARS AND SHELTERS CHILLIER EVEN THAN
THE GRAVELIKE TRENCHES THEY HAD LEFT ALWAYS WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS
THAT THEY WERE WATCHED BY INVISIBLE EYES WHICH PRESENTLY WOULD CHOOSE
CERTAIN OF THEM TO BE KILLED THOSE WHO CAME THROUGH IT SAY THAT THE
SENSE OF THIS BROODING DEATH MORE AFFECTED EVERY PHASE OF LIFE IN THE
SALIENT THAN IN ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE GREAT WARFIELD

THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE ON THE BLUFF AND THE NECESSARY MEASURES OF
RETALIATION DID NOT CONCERN THE BATTALION FOR THE MOMENT AFTER A
FEW DAYS AIMLESS WAITING THEY WERE SENT IN BITTER COLD AND SNOW
TO RESTCAMP AT CALAIS FOR A WEEK THEY WERE SEVEN HOURS SLIPPING
AND SLIDING ALONG THE SNOWCOVERED ROADS ERE THEY COULD ENTRAIN AT
BAVICHORE STREET AND UNTOLD HOURS DETRAINING AT THE OTHER END
ALL OF WHICH ANNOYED THEM MORE THAN ANY BOMBING EVEN THOUGH THE
CO HIMSELF COMPLIMENTED THEM ON THEIR MARCH UNDER VERY TRYING
CIRCUMSTANCES THE IRISH PARTICULARLY IN THEIR OWN BATTALIONS HAVE
NOT THE RELIEF OF SWEARING AS OTHER RACES DO THEIR TEMPERAMENT RUNS
TO EXTRAVAGANT COMPARISONS AND APPEALS TO THE SAINTS AND ORDINARY
FOUL LANGUAGE EVEN ON NIGHTRELIEFS IN MUDDY TRENCHES CHOKED WITH
LOOSE WIRES AND CORPSES IS CHECKED BY THE PRIESTS BUT AS ONE SAID
WHAT WE FELT ON THAT CRUEL CALAIS ROAD SKATIN INTO EACH OTHER
ANAN APOLOGISIN WOULD HAVE MELTED ALL THE SNOWS OF EUROPE THAT
WINTER

BOMBING INSTRUCTION AND INTERPLATOON BOMBING MATCHES ON CALAIS BEACH
KEPT THEM EMPLOYED

ON MARCH 3 DURING PRACTICE WITH LIVE BOMBS ONE EXPLODED
PREMATURELY AS SEVERAL OTHERS OF THAT TYPE HAD DONE IN OTHER
BATTALIONS AND MAJOR LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD WAS SO SEVERELY WOUNDED
THAT HE DIED WITHIN AN HOUR AT THE MILLICENT SUTHERLAND NO 9 RED
CROSS HOSPITAL LIEUTENANT T E G NUGENT WAS DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THE LIVER THOUGH HE DID NOT REALISE THIS
AT THE TIME AND STAYED COOLLY IN CHARGE OF A PARTY TILL HELP CAME
LIEUTENANT HANBURY WHO WAS CONDUCTING THE PRACTICE WAS WOUNDED IN
THE HAND AND LEG AND FATHER LANEFOX LOST AN EYE AND SOME FINGERS

LORD DESMOND FITZGERALD WAS BURIED IN THE PUBLIC CEMETERY AT CALAIS
ON THE 5TH AS HE HIMSELF HAD EXPRESSLY DESIRED THERE WAS NO FORMAL
PARADE BUT THE WHOLE BATTALION OF WHICH HE WAS NEXT FOR THE
COMMAND LINED THE ROAD TO HIS GRAVE HIS PASSION AND HIS LOYALTY HAD
BEEN GIVEN TO THE BATTALION WITHOUT THOUGHT OF SELF AND AMONG MANY
SAD THINGS FEW ARE SADDER THAN TO SEE THE RECORD OF HIS UNCEASING
ACTIVITIES AND CARE SINCE HE HAD BEEN SECOND IN COMMAND CUT ACROSS BY
THE CURT ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS DEATH IT WAS A LITTLE THING THAT HIS
NAME HAD BEEN AT THE TIME SUBMITTED FOR A WELLDESERVED DSO IN A
HARDPRESSED BODY OF MEN DEATH AND SICKNESS CARRY A SPECIAL STING
BECAUSE THE VICTIM KNOWSAND IN THE VERY ARTICLES OF DEATH FEELS
ITWHAT CONFUSION AND EXTRA WORK REARRANGEMENT AND ADJUSTMENTS OF
RESPONSIBILITIES HIS ENFORCED DEFECTION MUST LAY UPON HIS COMRADES
THE WINTER HAD BROUGHT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SICKNESS AND MINOR
ACCIDENTS AMONG THE OFFICERS SMALL IN THEMSELVES BUT CUMULATIVELY
A BURDEN IRREPLACEABLE NCOS HAD GONE OR WERE GOING TO TAKE
COMMISSIONS IN THE LINE OTHERS OF UNPROVEN CAPACITIES HAD TO BE
FETCHED FORWARD IN THEIR PLACE WARLEY OF COURSE WAS NOT ANXIOUS TO
SEND ITS BEST NCOS AWAY FROM A DEPOT CHOKED WITH RECRUITS THE
DETAIL OF LIFE WAS HARD AND CUMBERSOME IT WAS A LENGTHY BUSINESS
EVEN TO DRAW A TYPEWRITING MACHINE FOR USE IN THE TRENCHES COMPANIES
TWO THIRDS FULL OF FRESH DRAFTS HAD TO BE ENTRUSTED TO OFFICERS WHO
MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE THE DIVINE GIFT OF LEADERSHIP AND WHEN
ALL WAS SET TOMORROWS CHANCESPUN SHELL MIGHT BREAK AND BURY THE
MOST CAREFULLY THOUGHTOUT COMBINATIONS THINGS CHANGE SO QUICKLY
NOWADAYS DESMOND FITZGERALD WROTE NOT LONG BEFORE HIS DEATH IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE AHEAD AND DEATH TOOK HIM ON CALAIS BEACH IN THE
FULL STRIDE OF HIS POWER

HE HAD QUIETLY PRESENTED THE BATTALION THE YEAR BEFORE WITH SERVICE
DRUMS NO MENTION NEED BE MADE OF WHO PAID THEY WERE THE ONLY
BATTALION OF THE BRIGADE WHICH LACKED THEM AT THAT TIME AND THEY HAD
BEEN THE ONLY BATTALION TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE
WAR WHEN DURING THE RETREAT FROM MONS THE ARTILLERY DROVE OVER
THE BIG DRUM AT LANDRECIES

TEMPORARY CAPTAIN A F L GORDON FOLLOWED LIEUTENANT NUGENT AS
ADJUTANT AND THE REV F M BROWNE FROM GHQ REPLACED FATHER
LANEFOX THEY MOVED INTO THE SALIENT AGAIN ON THE 6TH MARCH
BILLETING AT WORMHOUDT AND WERE TOLD SEVERAL UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT
THE STATE OF THE LINE AND THE VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF RETALIATION
THAT THEY MIGHT EXPECT FROM THEIR OWN ARTILLERY

THE SNOW STOPPED ALL TRAINING EXCEPT A LITTLE BOMBING OPINION AS
TO THE VALUE OF BOMBS DIFFERED EVEN IN THOSE EARLY DAYS BUT THEY
WERE THE ORDER OF THE DAY AND GAVE OFFICERS THE CHANCE TO PUT IN
PRACTICE THEIR PET THEORIES OF BOWLING A COMMANDING OFFICER OF GREAT
EXPERIENCE WROTE A YEAR LATER AFTER THE BATTLE OF ARRAS THANKING
HEAVEN THAT THAT AFFAIR HAD LED TO THE REDISCOVERY OF THE RIFLE AS
A SUITABLE WEAPON FOR INFANTRY ADDING I SWEAR A BOMB IS OF ALL
WEAPONS THE MOST FUTILE IN WHICH TO SPECIALIZE

THE FRENCH WERE AS KEEN ON THE BOMB AS THE REST OF THE WORLD AND
PARTIES OF OFFICERS VISITED OUR BOMBING COMPETITIONS AT WORMHOUDT
WHERE THE BATTALION LAY TILL THE 16TH MARCH MOVING TO BILLETS
BRANDHOEK NEAR VLAMERTINGHE FOR ST PATRICKS DAY AND THE SPORTS
SACRED TO THE OCCASION THEY WERE PLAYED INTO CAMP BY A NAVAL PARTY
TO THE TUNE OF A LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE NOT A LITTLE TO THEIR
ASTONISHMENT A LITTLE LATER THEY WERE TO BE EVEN MORE ASTONISHED

THEN THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE TOOK OVER THEIR SECTOR OF THE FOURTEENTH
DIVISIONS NEW FRONT FROM THE SIXTH DIVISION AND AS USUAL
COMPLAINED THAT THE TRENCHES WHICH RAN FROM THE EAST TO THE TOWN WERE
IN BAD CONDITION THE BRIGADE RESERVE CAMP NEAR VLAMERTINGHE WAS NOT
MUCH BETTER IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT AT THIS DATE A TRAIN SPECIALLY
OILED AND TREATED TO RUN NOISELESSLY THROUGH THE NIGHT USED TO TAKE
THE RELIEFS UP INTO YPRESA JOURNEY THAT DID NOT LACK EXCITEMENT

ON THE 23RD MARCH AS THE BATTALION WAS GOING INTO THE TRENCHES
ON THE YPRES CANAL BANK THE MEANING OF THAT NAVAL PARTY AT
VLAMERTINGHE BECAME PLAINER THREE NAVAL OFFICERS AND TWENTYFIVE
PETTY OFFICERS ON SPECIAL LEAVE APPEARED AMONG THEM FOR THE PURPOSE
OF SPENDING A HAPPY FOUR DAYS WITH THEM AT THEIR LABOURS THEY WORE
THE UNIFORMS OF PRIVATE SOLDIERS WITHOUT PACK OR EQUIPMENT AND WERE
FIRST SEEN JOYOUSLY WALKING AND TALKING ON A WELLOBSERVED ROAD
WHICH COMBINATION OF MIRACLES LED THE AMAZED BEHOLDERS TO ASSUME
THAT THEY WERE EITHER LUNATICS OR ESCAPED CRIMINALS OF THE DEEPEST
DYE AND IT WAS A TOSSUP THAT THE WHOLE CHEERY PICNICPARTY WAS
NOT ARRESTEDOR SHOT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES ONE OFFICER AT LEAST
HAD THE LIVELIEST MEMORIES OF CHAPERONING FOR SEVERAL HOURS A NAVAL
OFFICER WITH A PASSION FOR PROFESSIONAL SOUVENIRS IN THE SHAPE OF
LARGECALIBRE SHELL FRAGMENTS IVE NEVER BEEN AT THE WRONG END OF
THIS SIZE GUN BEFORE THE MARINER WOULD SAY AS THE GERMAN HEAVIES
FELL ITS TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING I MUST JUST MAKE SURE ABOUT
THAT FUSE IF YOU DONT MIND THE HOST TO WHOM 59S AND MUCH
LARGER WERE NO NOVELTY FOR THE CANAL BANK DUGOUTS DID NOT KEEP
THEM OUT HAD TO FEIGN AN INTEREST HE DID NOT FEEL TILL IT DAWNED ON
THE SAILOR THAT IF HE PURSUED HIS INVESTIGATIONS TOO FAR HE WOULD
BE CUT OFF BY GERMAN PATROLS THE VISITORS ALL AGREED THAT SHIPS
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE HOTEL RITZ COMPARED TO THE DAILY
TRENCHROUTINE OF THE ARMY WE VAINGLORIOUSLY FIRED SEVERAL ROUNDS
FROM A 92 TO PLEASE THE SENIOR SERVICE WHO NATURALLY HAD SEEN SUCH
THINGS BEFORE THE ENEMY REPLIED WITH TWO DAYS FULL RETALIATION
AFTER THE NAVY HAD LEFT

YET AS THINGS WENT IN THE SALIENT IT WAS LIKE THEIR RESERVE
CAMP NOT TOO UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGH THERE WAS ONLY ONE WORKABLE
COMMUNICATIONTRENCH THE HAYMARKET TO THEIR LINE AND THAT A BAD
ONE THE MAIN ST JEAN ROAD COULD BE USED AFTER DARK AT REASONABLE
RISKS NO WORK WAS POSSIBLE BY DAYLIGHT BUT EXCEPT FOR GENERAL AND
INDISCRIMINATE SHELLING THEY LIVED QUIETLY EVEN WHEN AS HAPPENED
ON THE FIRST NIGHT MARCH 23 NO 1 COMPANY AND HEADQUARTERS WERE
SOLEMNLY MISGUIDED DOWN THE MENIN ROAD IN THE DARK OVER HELL FIRE
CORNER TO WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF HOOGE AND RETURNED WITHOUT
EVEN BEING FIRED AT THE REGIMENTAL TRANSPORT TOO MANAGED TO COME
UP AS FAR AS POTIJZE WITH SUPPLIES ON THREE OF THE FOUR NIGHTS OF
THE BATTALIONS FIRST TOUR AND HAD NO CASUALTIES THOUGH THE WOODS
WERE REGULARLY SHELLED THIS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY STROKE OF LUCK FOR
THE BATTALION SINCE OTHER TRANSPORTS HAD SUFFERED SEVERELY

THE OUTSTANDING WONDER THAT ANY ONE IN THE SALIENT SHOULD BE ALIVE
AT ALL IS NOT REFERRED TO IN THE DIARY MEN WHO WATCHED THE SHAPE
OF THAT CAPE OF DEATH RAKEN BY INCESSANT AEROPLANES AND CROSSCUT
BY GUNFIRE THAT FELL EQUALLY FROM THE FLANKS AND AS IT SEEMED THE
VERY REAR SOMETIMES SPECULATED AS DID THE FRENCH IN THE LIVELIER
HELLS OF VERDUN HOW LONG SOLID EARTH ITSELF COULD HOLD OUT AGAINST
THE UPHEAVALS OF THE ATTACK FLESH AND BLOOD COULD ENDURETHAT WAS
THEIR BUSINESSBUT THE GROUND ON WHICH THEY STOOD DID NOT ABIDE AS
ONE MAN SAID IT UD FLEE AWAY IN LUMPS UNDER THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT
TILL THERE WAS NO REST ANYWHERE

THEIR FIRST FOUR DAYS TOUR SAW THREE MEN KILLED IN THE LINE BY
A SINGLE WHIZZBANG IN A DUGOUT ONE WOUNDED AND AN OFFICER
LIEUTENANT R J P RODAKOWSKI SLIGHTLY HIT BY A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL
THEY BURIED THEIR DEAD BY NIGHT AT POTIJZE RELIEFS WERE THE REAL
DIFFICULTY FOR THE LINE AND THE ROADS WERE CONTINUOUSLY SHELLED
AND AT ANY MOMENT IN THE DUSK THEY MIGHT FIND THEIR ONLY SOUND
COMMUNICATIONTRENCH IMPASSABLE THEY WATCHED IT GO UP FROM END
TO END ONE DREADFUL NIGHT ON THE 29TH OF MARCH WHEN THEY WERE
IN SUPPORT AND THE GRENADIERS IN THE LINE AND THE KINGS COMPANY
WAS WIPED OUT ALMOST TO A MAN IT WAS A PRELUDE TO AN ATTACK THAT
NEVER ARRIVEDA SUDDENLY LAUNCHED SUDDENLY ARRESTED WANTONNESS OF
DESTRUCTION COMING GOING STANDING OR SITTING STILL GAVE NO MINUTE
OF GUARANTEED SAFETY A PARTY RETURNING FROM HOMELEAVE WERE CAUGHT
BY A SINGLE SHELL IN THE STREETS OF YPRES ON APRIL 2 SERGEANTMAJOR
KIRK AND A PRIVATE WERE KILLED AND AN NCO AND THREE MEN WERE
WOUNDED MEN DROPPED TOO ALMOST IN THE HOUR WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR
LEAVE THEY WORKED UP THE LINE OF NIGHTS HALF THE SHIFT AT A TIME
REPAIRING DAMAGE AND THE REMAINDER STANDING BY FOR ATTACKS

ON THE 3RD APRIL AFTER AN UNTOUCHED TURN OF DUTY EIGHT MEN WERE
WOUNDED BY BLIND FIRE DURING THE RELIEF

AT POPERINGHE ON APRIL 4 THEY WERE BILLETED IN THE CONVENT WHICH
SUPPLIED THEM WITH VARIETY ENTERTAINMENTS CINEMAS BAND CONCERTS
AND PERFORMING TROUPES ALL LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT TO BE DISPERSED BY
THE ENEMYS ARTILLERY OR PLANES AND THEREFORE DOUBLY PRECIOUS
THE BATTALION HAD ITS SHARE OF PROFESSIONAL HONOUR TOO IN A
MATTER OF CEREMONIAL AS REGARDS THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE BRIGADE OF
GUARDS IS ONE AS REGARDS THE VARIOUS BATTALIONS OF IT THERE ARE
ALLOWABLE INTERNAL DIFFERENCES OF OPINION CONSEQUENTLY WHEN A
RUSSIAN GENERAL LATE CHIEF OF THE STAFF TO THE GRAND DUKE NICHOLAS
OF RUSSIA VISITED POPERINGHE AND THE 1ST BATTALION OF THE IRISH
GUARDSOUT OF FIVE GUARDS BATTALIONS WITHIN REACHWAS CHOSEN AS
THE ONE FOR HIM TO INSPECT LIFE SMILED UPON THEM AND THEY ROSE TO
THE OCCASION HEAR THE WORDS OF AN OBSERVER EXPERIENCED IF NOT
ALTOGETHER DISINTERESTED THE DAY APRIL 5 WAS LOVELY AND OUR
FELLOWS IN SPITE OF THEIR MONTHS OF TRENCHWORK DID MAGNIFICENTLY
THE WONDERFUL PRECISION OF THEIR DRILL EXCITED THE ADMIRATION EVEN OF
OFFICERS BELONGING TO SOME OF THE OTHER REGIMENTS THE HUNS MISSED A
GRAND OPPORTUNITY

THE HUNS HAD THEIR REVENGE A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN THE BATTALIONS
BILLETS AND HEADQUARTERS AT POPERINGHE WERE SUDDENLY ON APRIL 11
SHELLED JUST AS THE BATTALION WAS GOING INTO LINE AT YPRES THE
THING BEGAN ALMOST WITH A JEST THE REGIMENTAL CHAPLAIN WAS TAKING
CONFESSIONS AS IS USUAL BEFORE GOING UP IN POPERINGHE CHURCH WHEN
THE BUILDING ROCKED TO BURSTS OF BIG STUFF OBVIOUSLY DRAWING NEARER
HE TURNED TO OPEN THE CONFESSIONALSLIDE AND SMELT GASCHLORINE
BEYOND DOUBT WHILE HE GROPED WILDLY FOR HIS GASHELMET IN THE
DUSK THE PENITENT REASSURED HIM ITS ALL RIGHT FATHER IVE
BEEN TO DIVISIONAL GAS SCHOOL TODAY THAT SMELLS OFF MY CLOTHES
RELIEVED THE PADRE WENT ON WITH HIS DUTIES TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT
OF GLASS FALLING FROM THE WINDOWS AND WHEN HE CAME OUT FOUND
THE PORCH FILLED WITH A SMALL CROWD WHO REPORTED LOTS OF MEN
HIT IN AN AMBULANCE DOWN THE ROAD THITHER RAN THE PADRE TO MEET
A MAN CRAZY WITH TERROR WHOM A SHELLBURST HAD FLUNG ACROSS THE
STREET HALFSTRIPPED AND BLACKENED FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE WAS GIVEN
ABSOLUTION BECAME ALL OF A SUDDEN VEHEMENTLY SICK AND DROPPED INTO
STUPOR NEXT ON A STRETCHER AN IRISH GUARDSMAN CRUSHED BY A FALLEN
WALL REPORTED FOR THE MOMENT AS NOT SERIOUS AS THE PRIEST TURNED
TO GO FOR MORE WOUNDED MEN WERE BEING BORNE UP THROUGH THE DUSK
THE LAD WAS RETAKEN BY A VIOLENT HMORRHAGE SUPREME UNCTION AT ONCE
WAS HIS NEED CAPTAIN WOODHOUSE RAMC THE REGIMENTAL DOCTOR
APPEARED OUT OF THE DARKNESS WOUNDED IN THE ARM AND SHOULDER HIS
UNIFORM NEARLY RIPPED OFF HIM AND VERY BUSY HE HAD BEEN ATTENDING
A WOUNDED MAN IN A HOUSE NEAR HEADQUARTERS WHEN A SHELL BURST AT
THE DOOR MORTALLY WOUNDED THE PATIENT KILLED ONE STRETCHERBEARER
OUTRIGHT AND SERIOUSLY WOUNDED TWO OTHERS THE PADRE DODGING SHELLS
EN ROUTE DIVED INTO THE CELLARS OF THE HOUSE WHERE HE WAS BILLETED
FOR THE SACRED ELEMENTS WENT BACK TO THE WAYSIDE DRESSINGSTATION
FOUND A MAN OF THE BUFFS UNCONSCIOUS BUT EVIDENTLY A CATHOLIC FOR
HE CARRIED A SCAPULAR SEWED IN HIS TUNIC ANOINTED HIM ANDTHE
VISITATION HAVING PASSED LIKE A THUNDERSTORMTRUDGED INTO YPRES
UNWORRIED BY ANYTHING WORSE THAN CASUAL MACHINEGUN FIRE AND SET
HIMSELF TO FIND SOME SUFFICIENTLY LARGE SOUND CELLAR FOR BATTALION
MASS NEXT MORNING THE BATTALION FOLLOWED A LITTLE LATER AND WENT
UNDERGROUND IN YPRESHEADQUARTERS AND A COMPANY IN THE CARMELITE
CONVENT TWO COMPANIES IN THE SOLID BRICK AND EARTH RAMPARTS THAT
ENDURE TO THIS DAY AND ONE IN THE CELLARS OF THE RUE DE MALINES

IT WAS THE MILDEST OF UPHEAVALSA STANDARDPATTERN AFFAIR HARDLY
NOTED BY ANY ONE BUT IT SERVES TO SHOW WHAT A PRIESTS AND A
DOCTORS DUTIES ARE WHEN THE IMMEDIATE HEAVY SILENCE AFTER A
SHELLBURST THAT SEEMS SO ASTOUNDINGLY LONG IS CUT BY THE OUTCRIES
OF WOUNDED MEN AND THE TWO HURRY OFF TOGETHER STUMBLING AND FEELING
THROUGH THE DARK TILL THE ELECTRIC TORCH PICKS UP SOME DIM VEILED
OUTLINE OR HIDEOUSLY DISPLAYS THE WOUNDS ON THE BODY THEY SEEK
THERE IS A TALE OF HALF A PLATOON AMONG WHOM A HEAVY GASSHELL
DROPPED AS THEY LAY IN THE FLANK OF A CUTTING BESIDE A ROAD THEIR
PLATOONCOMMANDER HURRIED TO THEM FOLLOWED BY THE SERGEANT CALLING
OUT TO KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE NO ONE REPLIED THE QUESTION
WAS REPEATED THEN SPEAK UP WHEN THE OFFICERS ASKIN CRIED THE
SCANDALIZED SERGEANT BUT EVEN THAT APPEAL FAILED THEY WERE ALL DEAD
WHERE THEY LAY AND HUMAN NATURE BEING WHAT IT IS THE SERGEANTS
WORDS BECAME A JOKE AGAINST HIM FOR MANY DAYS AFTER MEN CANNOT LIVE
IN EXTREME FEAR FOR MORE THAN A VERY LIMITED TIME NORMAL LITTLE
INTERESTS SAVE THEM SO WHILE THEY LAY IN CELLARS BY CANDLELIGHT
AT YPRES AND WORKED STEALTHILY AT NIGHT THE BATTALION FOUND TIME
TO MAKE A MOST BEAUTIFUL IRISH STAR FOUR FEET ACROSS OF GLASS AND
POUNDED BRICK FROM THE RUBBISH OF THE CONVENT GARDEN IT WAS A WORK
OF SUPEREROGATION ACCOMPLISHED WHILE CLEANING UP THE BILLETS WHICH
DREW FAVOURABLE NOTICE FROM HIGH AUTHORITIES

ON THE 16TH APRIL THEY WERE SHIFTED TO RELIEVE THE 2ND GRENADIERS AT
RAILWAY WOOD NORTHWEST OF HOOGE THIS WAS ALMOST THE MOST EASTERLY
POINT OF THE SALIENT ON THE NORTH OF THE MENIN ROAD BY THE ROULERS
RAILWAY AND RANKED AS QUITE THE LEAST DESIRABLE STRETCH OF AN
ACUTELY UNDESIRABLE LINE IN ADDITION TO EVERY OTHER DRAWBACK THE
WOOD WELLED WATER AT EVERY PORE FOR THE BELLEWAARDE BECK BROUGHT TO
IT ALL THE DRAINAGE FROM THE BELLEWAARDE RIDGE AND EVEN THE TRENCHES
ON HIGH GROUND WERE WATERLOGGED THEY WERE BOMBED FROM OVERHEAD AS
SOON AS THEY MOVED IN HELL FIRE CORNER WAS SHELLED ON THE 17TH APRIL
AND SIX MEN WERE WOUNDED

THE 18TH APRIL WAS QUIET ONLY TWO MEN WOUNDED AND EXCEPT FOR
VIOLENT BOMBARDMENTS NORTH AND SOUTH AND AN ATTACK ON WIELTJE AND
OTHER PLACES SO WAS THE 19TH WIELTJE WAS TWO THOUSAND YARDS
AND THE OTHER PLACES EVEN FARTHER AWAY THE DISTURBANCE WAS
NOTHING MORE THAN PRINCIPAL GERMAN ATTACKS ON FOUR DIFFERENT FRONTS
OF THE SALIENT AMONG MUD AND MUDFILLED SHELLHOLES AND CRATERS OF
OLD MINES WHERE MEN SUNK AND CHOKED WHERE THEY FOUGHT WAISTDEEP
IN THE DIRT WHERE THE CLOGGED RIFLES WERE USELESS AND THE BOMB
AND THE BAYONET WERE THE ONLY HOPE FROM ANY REASONABLE POINT OF
VIEW THE SALIENT WAS A PARTICULARLY WEAK POSITION ALWAYS WORTH AN
ATTACK IN THE INTERVALS OF ITS REGULAR USE AS A GUNNERY SCHOOL FOR
GERMAN ARTILLERY THE ENEMY KNEW THAT WE WERE ON THE WAY TO TAKE THE
PRESSURE OFF THE FRENCH AT VERDUN WHICH HAD BEEN A FACTORY OF DEATH
SINCE FEBRUARY AND ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE WELL TO MAKE TROUBLE
ANYWHERE THEY COULD THEY CHOSE THE 1ST AND 2ND CANADIAN DIVISIONS
ROUND YPRES AND FOUGHT THEM FOR TWO DAYS WITH VERY LITTLE PROFIT
BEYOND FILLING MORE SHELLHOLES WITH MORE DEAD

AT THAT DATE MEN HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THE COMPARATIVE VALUES
OF THEIR FLANKING DIVISIONS AND THE BATTALIONS IMMEDIATELY BESIDE
THEM WHEN A LOCAL ATTACK FELL ON SOME OF THESE THOSE UNAFFECTED
WOULD REST AS UNCONCERNEDLY AS THE WATCH BELOW TAKES ITS EASE WHEN
THE WATCH ON DECK IS STRUGGLING WITH THE SQUALL THE SYRENLIKE HOOT
OF THE GASHORNS ONE OR TWO MILES OFF MIGHT BREAK THEIR REST ON
RELIEF BUT THE DIVISION INVOLVED BEING KNOWN TO BE ADEQUATE THE
BATTALION WAS NOT ROUSED AND SPENT A QUIET DAY OTHER DIVISIONS
NEW TO THE LINE CAUSED ANXIETY AND INTERFERED WITH REGULAR ROUTINE
TILL THEY HAD SHAKEN INTO PLACE AND YET OTHERS MIGHT BE ALWAYS
TRUSTED TO HOOT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP ON THE LEAST PROVOCATION
THESE PECULIARITIES WOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THE CANTONMENTS AND
COFFEEBARS OF THE RESTAREAS OR LATER OUT ON THE ROADSIDE
WITH AN OCCASIONAL FARRANGING GERMAN SHELL TO INTERRUPT A REALLY
PLEASANT INTERBATTALION OR DIVISIONAL ARGUMENT WHERE IF REPORTS
BE TRUE EVEN THE MILITARY POLICE SOMETIMES FORGET TO BE IMPARTIAL
AND THERE WERE UNAMBITIOUS UNIMPROVING UNITS QUITE CONTENT TO
ACCEPT ANYTHING THAT THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD LEFT THEM IN THE WAY OF
OPENWORK PARAPETS GAPPED SANDBAGS AND SMASHED TRAVERSES AGAINST
THESE EXPERIENCED CORPS BUILDED NOT WITHOUT OSTENTATION STRONG
FLANKS SO THAT IF THEIR NEIGHBOURS WENT OF A SUDDEN THEY THEMSELVES
MIGHT STILL HAVE A CHANCE FOR THEIR LIVES THE IRISH HAD A SAYING
OF THEIR OWNA SORT OF LILTING CALL THAT RAN DOWN THE TRENCHES AT
ODD TIMESTO THE EFFECT THAT GOD BEING IN HIS HEAVEN AND THE
MICKS IN THE LINE ALL WAS WELL POMPOM EVERY BATTALION TOO
HAD ITS OWN VERSION OF THE ANCIENT WARSONG WHICH CLAIMS THAT THEY
THEMSELVES WERE IN THE FRONT LINE WITH THEIR BEST FRIENDS OF THE
MOMENT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THEM BUT THAT WHEN THEY WENT TO LOOK FOR
SUCHANDSUCH A BATTALION WITH WHOM THEY WERE UNFRIENDS FOR THE
MOMENT THEY WERE BLESSED OR OTHERWISE IF THEY COULD FIND THEM

THEIRS WAS THE MISFORTUNE TO BE THE ONLY BATTALION OF THE DIVISION
AVAILABLE FOR FATIGUES DURING THEIR SIXTEEN DAYS TOUR SO THEY
SUPPLIED PARTIES WITHOUT INTERMISSION BOTH TO THE TRENCHES ROUND
RAILWAY WOOD AND IN BATTERED YPRES IN THE CELLARS WHERE THEY RESTED
BY CANDLELIGHT TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CRASHING MASONRY AND FLYING
PAVEMENT BLOCKS A FATIGUEPARTY UNDER LIEUTENANT T K WALKER
CARRYING ENGINEERS STUFF TO NEAR RAILWAY WOOD WAS CAUGHT AND
SHELLED ON THE 24TH ON THE LAST TWO HUNDRED YARDS OR SO OF UTTERLY
EXPOSED DUCKBOARDS EVERY PIECE OF WHICH THE ENEMY GUNS HAD TAPED TO
A YARD THE WATERLOGGED SOIL MADE ANY SORT OF TRENCHES HERE OUT OF
THE QUESTION MEN SLID AND STAGGERED ACROSS THE OPEN UNDER THEIR
LOADS TILL THE SHELLS CHOSE TO FIND THEM OR THEY REACHED RAILWAY
WOOD AND FOUND SOME COVER IN THE MINE WHICH WAS ALWAYS BEING MADE
THERE AND ALWAYS PUMPED OUT LIEUTENANT WALKER AND FOUR MEN WERE
KILLED AT ONCE AND SEVEN MEN WERE WOUNDED OF WHOM TWO AFTERWARDS
DIED IT WAS AS SWIFT AS THE SHELLING OF HEADQUARTERS AT POPERINGHE
ON THE 11TH AND CAPTAIN WOODHOUSE THE MO HAD TO GET FORWARD TO
THE WRECKAGE UNDER A HEAVY FIRE OF SHELLS AND AERIAL TORPEDOES WITH
OR NOT FAR FROM HIM WENT CRAWLED RAN OR FLOUNDERED THE PRIEST FOR
IF BY ANY MEANS THE BODY COULD BE RELIEVED REPAIRED OR EASED SO
COULD THE SOUL IT IS TRUE THAT BOTH THESE MEN MORE OR LESS RESPECTED
DIRECT ORDERS NOT TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TOO MUCH BUT THEY SUFFERED
FROM CURIOUS LAPSES OF MEMORY

THEN SPRING CAME TO THE SALIENT IN ONE SWIFT RUSH SO WARM AND SO
WINDLESS THAT AT THE END OF APRIL WHEN THEY WERE IN REST UNDER
LEAFING TREES AT POPERINGHE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DINE IN SHIRT
SLEEVES IN THE OPEN BY CANDLE AND STARLIGHT THE GENTLE WEATHER
EVEN SOFTENED THE EDGE OF WAR FOR A DAY OR TWO TILL YPRES AND THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE VIGOROUSLY SHELLED ON THE 5TH MAY THE BATTALION
WAS THEN IN YPRES PRISON AND THE CELLARS BENEATH IT WHERE SOME
UNLOVED ENTHUSIAST HAD DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR
DRILL PURPOSES IN THE MAIN GAOLCORRIDOR AND DRILLED THEY WERE
ACCORDINGLY TO THE MUSIC OF THE BOMBARDMENTS ON SUCH OCCASIONS
MEN WERE SOMETIMES SEEN TO BUDGE IE ROLL THEIR EYES IN THE
DIRECTION OF PLASTER AND STONES FALLING FROM THE CEILING FOR WHICH
HEINOUS CRIME THEIR NAMES WERE JUSTLY TAKEN

ON THE 9TH MAY THEY RELIEVED THE 2ND GRENADIERS ON THE LEFT SECTOR OF
THEIR BRIGADES FRONT AT WIELTJE WHERE WHAT WERE ONCE TRENCHES HAD
BEEN BOMBED AND SHELLED INTO A SKETCHY STRING OF BOMBINGPOSTSOR
AS A MAN SAID GROUSEBUTTS IT WAS PERHAPS ONE DEGREE WORSE THAN
THEIR STRETCH AT HOOGE AND NECESSITATED COMPANIES AND POSTS BEING
SCATTERED AS THE GROUND SERVED BETWEEN WHAT WAS LEFT OF WIELTJE
ST JEAN AND LA BRIQUE THE ENEMY OPENED BY SHELLING THE RESERVE
COMPANY NO 4 AT ST JEAN AND WOUNDING EIGHT MEN WHILE THEIR
MACHINEGUN FIRE HELD UP ALL WORK IN THE FRONT LINE WHERE NO 1
COMPANY WAS TRYING TO DIG A COMMUNICATIONTRENCH THROUGH OLD DIRT AND
DEAD TO NO 2 COMPANY IN SUPPORT

THE DEMONSTRATION MIGHT HAVE MEANT ANYTHING OR NOTHING BUT TO BE ON
THE SAFE SIDE AND TO COMPLY WITH BRIGADE ORDERS REGULAR OBSERVATION
AND SNIPERS POSTS WERE POSTED HENCEFORWARD AND LIEUTENANT
RODAKOWSKI WAS STRUCK OFF ALL TRENCH DUTIES AS INTELLIGENCE AND
SNIPING OFFICER THE ARRANGEMENTS AND SUPERVISION OF A DOZEN OR SO
SNIPERS IMAGINATIVE STOLID OR FRANKLY BORED AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
AND THE COLLATION OF THEIR VARIOUS REPORTS BASED FOR VERY LITTLE
COULD BE ACTUALLY SEEN ON THE CELTIC IMAGINATION OPERATING AT LARGE
THE WHOLE TO BE REVISED AND CORRECTED FROM HOUR TO HOUR BY ONES OWN
FACULTIES OF OBSERVATION AND DEDUCTION MAKE INTELLIGENCE WORK A
LITTLE STRENUOUS

ON THE 12TH MAY ST JEAN WHICH INCLUDED BATTALION HEADQUARTERS HALF
WAY BETWEEN ST JEAN AND WIELTJE WAS HEAVILY SHELLED FOR EIGHT HOURS
OF THE NIGHT WITH HEAVY STUFFBUT NO CASUALTIES BEYOND A COUPLE OF
MEN WOUNDED

ON THE 18TH MAY WHEN THEY WERE IN THE LINE ONCE MORE THE ENEMY
WHO HAD RECENTLY BEEN REMARKABLY QUIET MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RUSH A
BOMBINGPOST BUT SAYS THE DIARY LIEUTENANT TISDALL AND 4182
PRIVATE A YOUNG CAME UPON THEM UNEXPECTEDLY AND OWING TO THE
FORMERS COOLNESS AND THE LATTERS VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE ACTION WITH
RIFLE AND BOMBS THE HOSTILE PARTY ABOUT TWENTY FLED THE DIARY
IS NEVER EMOTIONAL IN SUCH LITTLE MATTERS AS THESE AND THE OFFICERS
CONCERNED SAY LESS THAN NOTHING IT IS THE OLDTIMERS AMONG THE MEN
WHO CHERISH MEMORIES OF THE VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE ACTION NO PEN DARE
PUT ON PAPER THE SPEECH OF THE ORDERLY WHO WITH RIFLE AND BOMB
ERUPTS ALONG THE TRENCH OR OVER THE EDGE OF THE SHELLCRATER EITHER
IN DEADLY SILENCE OR WITH THREATENINGS AND SLAUGHTER IN HIS OWN
DIALECT AND WHEN THE QUICK GRISLY BUSINESS IS OVER CONVULSES HIS
ASSOCIATES WITH HIS PRIVATE VERSION OF IT

THE ORDERLY GOT THE DCM AND THE OFFICER THE MILITARY CROSS

THE ENEMY RETALIATED NEXT NIGHT BY SHELLING THE SUPPORT LINE AND
WOUNDED SEVEN MEN JUST AS THE BATTALION WAS GOING INTO REST AND
WAS RELIEVED LATE WHICH THEY NOTICED WITH DEEP DISPLEASURE BY A
BATTALION OF THE TWENTIETH DIVISION

THE 20TH MAY SAW THEM IN THE CLEAN BACKAREA AT THE PLEASANT
WELLTREED VILLAGE OF LONGUENESSE THREE MILES SOUTHWEST OF ST
OMER ALL TOGETHER IN GOOD BILLETS AND PLENTY OF CLEAN STRAW AT ONE
FARM HEADQUARTERS AT A NEIGHBOURING CHTEAU THE 2ND COLDSTREAM
THEIR PARTICULAR FRIENDS WITH THEM AND THE OTHER BATTALIONS OF THEIR
BRIGADE AT VILLAGES NEAR BY THE WEATHER WAS GOOD FOR A WEEK AT
LEAST WORK WAS REASONABLE AND THEY ALL WENT TO PAY A VISIT DISGUISED
AS A BATTALION DRILL TO THE PARADE GROUND OF THE CADETSCHOOL AT
BLENDECQUES OF WHICH LIEUTENANT J HALLIGAN LATE ORDERLYROOM
QUARTERMASTERSERGEANT OF THE BATTALION WAS ADJUTANT IT IS
REASONABLE TO INFER THAT THE RUSSIAN GENERAL AT THE POPERINGHE CAMP
GOT NO BETTER IN THE WAY OF A CEREMONIAL PARADE THAN DID THEIR OLD
COMRADE

THE SHADOW OF PREPARATIONS FOR THE SOMME FELL OVER THEM AFTERWARDS
THEY DUG QUADRUPLE LINES OF TRENCHES AND ASSAULTED THEM IN FULL KIT
WITH GAS HELMETS AND FOUND TIME BETWEEN WHILES TO HOLD A BOXING
COMPETITION AT WHICH THE 12TH LANCERS ARRIVED WITH THEIR PRIVATE
YOUNG WHO WAS DEFEATED BY THE BATTALIONS COMPANY SERGEANTMAJOR
VOYLES THESE THINGS ARE AS SACRED AS THE ETON DINNER AT ST OMER ON
THE 3RD JUNE WHICH SEVEN OFFICERS FROM THE BATTALION ATTENDED

ON THE 7TH JUNE THEY MOVED ON A TWELVEMILE MARCH TO HONDEGHEM UNDER
CASSEL EN ROUTE FOR A POPERINGHE CAMP ONCE MORE AND DEVELOPED
SEVERAL CASES OF SORE FEET THIS WAS PUT DOWN TO A BAD ISSUE OF
SOCKS BUT IT SUPPORTS THE THEORY OF THE SERGEANTS MESS THAT
NOTHING BUT CAREFUL INSPECTION COUPLED WITH STEADY ROUTEMARCHING
CAN PUT A FOOT ON MEN WHO HAVE BEEN PADDLING IN TRENCHMUD WITH
TWISTED WATERLOGGED BOOTS

AT POPERINGHE THEY WERE COOLIES AGAIN TILL THEY WENT INTO LINE ON THE
15TH JUNE A PERMANENT FATIGUEPARTY OF 150 UNDER 2ND LIEUTENANTS
HEGARTY AND EARLE WAS SENT TO THE ENGINEERS NEAR YPRES ANOTHER A
HUNDRED STRONG HELPED TO BURY FIELDCABLES BY NIGHT AT BRIELEN ON
THE YPRESELVERDINGHE ROAD A PLACE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BY THE ENEMYS
ARTILLERY BUT DIGGING IS RECKONED BETTER THAN DRILL AND THEIR NEXT
TOUR OF DUTY WAS TO BE A WEARISOME ONE LIEUTENANT J N MARSHALL
FROM THE ENTRENCHING BATTALION JOINED ON THE 15TH AND LIEUTENANT J
K GREER TOOK COMMAND OF NO 1 COMPANY LIEUTENANT LAW BEING ON A
COURSE

THEY RELIEVED THE 11TH ESSEX AND THE 8TH BEDFORDSHIRES SIXTH
DIVISION ON THE NIGHT OF THE 16TH IN THE SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME
OF ONE HOUR WHICH WAS NEARLY A RECORD AND SHOWED THAT ALL HANDS
WERE ABREAST OF THEIR WORK THEIR NEW SECTOR LAY NORTHWEST OF
WIELTJE AND DUE NORTH OF YPRES COVERING THE YPRESPILCKEM ROAD
WITH SUPPORTS AT LANCASHIRE FARM AND THE BATTALION HEADQUARTERS AMID
LOOSE BRICKS AND MUD ON THE CANAL BANK THE TRENCHES WERE BAD ONLY
ONE COMMUNICATIONTRENCH SKIPTON ROAD WAS MODERATELY DRY AND THE
PARAPETS WERE THIN LOW AND BADLY GAPPED WHICH GAVE ENEMY SNIPERS
THEIR CHANCE TWO MEN WERE KILLED OUTRIGHT THE FIRST DAY ONE DIED OF
WOUNDS AND FOUR WERE WOUNDED

NO MANS LAND AT THIS POINT WAS SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS DEEP AND
COVERED WITH LONG GRASS AND WEEDS THE PERISCOPES SOON LEARNED TO
KNOW THAT POPPIES AND THISTLES GREW BRIGHTEST AND TALLEST ROUND THE
EDGES OF SHELLHOLES AND SINCE SHELLHOLES MEANT COVER ALL PATROLS
DIRECTED THEIR BELLYFLAT COURSE TO THEM

ON THE 18TH JUNE OFFICER PATROLS WENT OUT TO LOOK AT THE ENEMYS
WIRE SECOND LIEUTENANT F H N LEE WAS WOUNDED IN THE LEG WHILE
CLOSE TO IT AND WAS CARRIED BACK BY NO 3836 CORPORAL REDMOND DYING
LATER OF GANGRENE ANOTHER OFFICER LIEUTENANT HON P OGILVY RAN
BY MISTAKE INTO WIRE ON HIS RETURN JOURNEY AND HAD TO FIGHT HIS WAY
BACK WITH HIS ORDERLY ONE MAN WAS KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED BESIDES
THE WOUNDED OFFICER

ON THE 19TH LIEUTENANT J N MARSHALL WHILE OUT WITH A
WORKINGPARTY WAS SNIPED IN THE ARM BUT FINISHED HIS WORK BEFORE
REPORTING IT A MAN WAS KILLED AND TWO WERE WOUNDED THE DAY WAS
NORMALPROBABLY THE QUIETEST OF THE TOUR SAYS THE DIARY BUT
ONE MAY BE CERTAIN THAT CERTAIN INCONSPICUOUS GERMAN SNIPERS WERE
CONGRATULATING THEMSELVES ON THEIR BAG THE BULK OF THE TROUBLE CAME
FROM FIVE OLD DUGOUTS KNOWN AS THE CANADIAN DUGOUTS SOME TWO OR
THREE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN IN OUR HANDS THESE HAD
BEEN WIRED ROUND COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY AND THEIR GRASSGROWN
IRREGULAR MOUNDAGE MADE PERFECT SNIPERS NESTS

THE BATTALION LAY FROM THE 21ST TO THE 23RD JUNE IN SHELTERS ROUND
AND CELLARS BENEATH ELVERDINGHE CHTEAU THE TREES OF WHICH WERE
STILL STANDING SO THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PUT IN AN INSPECTION AND
A LITTLE DRILL BENEATH THEM BUT CAREFUL WATCH HAD TO BE KEPT FOR
HOSTILE AEROPLANES DRILL UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS DISCIPLINE
OF THE HIGHEST TIS NOT THE DHRILL YELL UNDERSTAND BUT THE
NOT BUDGIN IN THE RANKS THATS SO HARD TO COME BY FOR YELL
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CANT HELP LIFTIN AN EYE WHEN YOU HEAR THEM
BUZZIN ABOVE AND OF COURSE IF A MAN BUDGES ON PARADE HELL BE
RESTLESS WHEN HES SHELLED

OUR ARTILLERY HAD BEEN CUTTING GERMAN WIRE ON THE FRONT OF THE
DIVISION WITH THE IDEA OF RAIDS TO FOLLOW CONSEQUENTLY THERE WAS
NIGHTFIRING ON BOTH SIDES WHEN THE BATTALION WENT BACK ON THE 24TH
THE TRENCHES HAD BEEN A LITTLE IMPROVED AND ONE MAN ONLY WAS KILLED
AND ONE WOUNDED BY THE SNIPERS

ON THE 26TH JUNE FOUR MEN WERE SNIPED ON THE 27TH JUNE WIRECUTTING
BY OUR GUNS DREW HEAVY RETALIATION FROM THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT F L
PUSCH DSO AS BRAVE A MAN AS THE WAR MADE WHO HAD ONLY COME UP
FROM THE ENTRENCHING BATTALION A FEW DAYS BEFORE WAS SNIPED AND
KILLED AT ONCE HE HAD GONE WITH HIS ORDERLY TO PICK UP A WOUNDED MAN
IN A TRENCH AND BOTH WERE HIT BY THE SAME BULLET THE SNIPER DID HIS
BEST TO KILL PRIVATE CARROLL WHO DRAGGED THE WOUNDED MAN AND THE
OFFICERS BODY UNDER COVER PRIVATE CARROLL WAS AWARDED THE MILITARY
MEDAL FOR THIS FOUR DEAD AND SEVEN WOUNDED WERE THAT NIGHTS TOTAL

THE 28TH JUNE WAS THE WORST OF THAT TOUR THE ENEMY OPENED ON
THE TRENCHES AND SUPPORTS THROUGH NIGHT AND DAY WITH EVERYTHING
AVAILABLE DOWN TO AERIAL TORPEDOES KILLING FIVE MEN AND WOUNDING
EIGHT

THE CASUALTIES FOR A QUIET TWELVE DAYS TOUR INCLUDING THREE DAYS
ONLY IN THE FRONT LINE WERE THREE OFFICERS AND FORTYSEVEN OTHER
RANKS KILLED AND WOUNDED SOME OF THE CREDIT OF THIS MUST GO TO THE
GERMAN SNIPERS WHO WORKING WITHOUT NOISE OR DISPLAY GAVE THE
BATTALION THE IDEA THERE WAS NOTHING MUCH DOING THE BRUTAL OUTCRY OF
ARTILLERY ITS VISIBLE EFFECT ON THE GROUNDABOVE ALL THE DEADLY
ACCURACY OF THE SINGLE AIMED SHELLS ON THE WELLREGISTERED TRENCH
FROM WHICH NONE MUST MOVEUPSET MEN SOMETIMES MORE THAN REPEATED
SINGLE CASUALTIES IN THE FRONT LINE WHICH CAN BE HURRIED OFF ROUND
THE TRAVERSES WITHOUT ROUSING MORE THAN A FEW COMPANIONS

THEY LAY FOR A WEEK BENEATH THE TREES NEAR POPERINGHE AND STARTED
INTERPLATOON BOMBING COMPETITIONS TO ACCUSTOM THE MEN TO THROW
OVERARM WITHOUT JERKING THESE LITTLE EVENTS FORBADE MONOTONY AND
WERE SOMETIMES RATHER LIKE REAL WARFARE FOR NOT EVERY ONE CAN BE
TRUSTED TO DELIVER A BALL ACCURATELY WHEN HE IS THROWING IN AGAINST
TIME


THE SOMME

MEANWHILE VERDUN HAD BEEN IN THE FIRE SINCE FEBRUARY THERE WAS NO
SIGN OF THE ATTACKS ON IT WEAKENING AND FRANCE AND THE WORLD LOOKED
UNEASILY AT THAT DREAD POINT OF CONTACT WHERE MEN AND STUFF CONSUMED
AS THE CARBON OF ARCLIGHTS CONSUMES IN THE CURRENT IT WAS TIME
THAT ENGLAND SHOULD TAKE THE STRAIN EVEN THOUGH HER TROOPS WERE NOT
FULLY TRAINED OR HER GUNS YET FREE TO SPEND SHELLS AS THE NEEDS OF
THE WAR DEMANDED WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE WAS MERELY THE INITIAL DEPOSIT
ON THE PRICE OF NATIONAL UNPREPAREDNESS WHAT WAS TO COME NO MORE
THAN A FIRST INSTALMENT IT WAS VITAL TO SAVE VERDUN TO SO HOLD THE
ENEMY ON THE WESTERN FRONT THAT HE COULD NOT SEND TOO MUCH HELP TO
HIS EASTERN LINE OR HIS AUSTRIAN ALLIES WHO LAY HEAVY ON THE ITALIAN
ARMY MOST VITAL TO KILL AS MANY GERMANS AS POSSIBLE

THE MAIN STRENGTH THE ACTUAL SPINE OF THE POSITION SO FAR AS THE
BRITISH FRONT WAS CONCERNED WAS SOME TWENTYFIVE MILES OF HIGH
GROUND FORMING THE WATERSHED BETWEEN THE SOMME AND THE RIVERS OF
SOUTHERN BELGIUM WHICH RAN ROUGHLY FROM MARICOURT IN THE SOUTH
WHERE OUR LINE JOINED THE FRENCH TO GOMIECOURT IN THE NORTH HERE
THE ENEMY HAD SAT UNTROUBLED FOR TWO YEARS LOOKING DOWN UPON
FRANCE AND DAILY STRENGTHENING HIMSELF HIS TREBLED AND QUADRUPLED
LINES OF DEFENCE WORKED FOR HIM BY HIS PRISONERS RAN BELOW AND
ALONG THE FLANKS AND ON THE TOPS OF FIVEHUNDREDFOOT DOWNS SOME
OF THESE WERE STUDDED WITH CLOSE WOODS DEADLIER EVEN THAN THE
FORTIFIED VILLAGES BETWEEN THEM SOME CUT WITH NARROWING VALLEYS
THAT DREW MACHINEGUN FIRE AS CHIMNEYS DRAW DRAFTS SOME OPENING
INTO BROAD SEEMINGLY SMOOTH SLOPES WHOSE EVERY HAUNCH AND HOLLOW
COVERED SUNK FORTS CAREFULLY PLACED MINEFIELDS MACHINEGUN PITS
GIGANTIC QUARRIES ENLARGED IN THE CHALK CONNECTING WITH SYSTEMS
OF CATACOMBLIKE DUGOUTS AND SUBTERRANEAN WORKS AT ALL DEPTHS IN
WHICH BRIGADES COULD LIE TILL THE FITTING MOMENT BELT UPON BELT OF
FIFTYYARDDEEP WIRE PROTECTED THESE POINTS EITHER DIRECTLY OR AT
SUCH ANGLES AS SHOULD HERD AND HOLD UP ATTACKING INFANTRY TO THE FIRE
OF VEILED GUNS NOTHING IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HAD BEEN NEGLECTED OR
UNFORESEEN EXCEPT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE MEN WHO IN DUE
TIME SHOULD WEAR THEIR RED WAY THROUGH EVERY YARD OF IT

NEITHER SIDE ATTEMPTED TO CONCEAL THEIR PLANS THE WORK OF OUR AIRMEN
WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO HAVE WARNED THE ENEMY WHAT WAS INTENDED
EVEN HAD HIS OWN MEN OVERLOOKED THE IMMENSE ASSEMBLY OF TROOPS AND
GUNS IN A BREADTH OF COUNTRY THAT HAD BEEN REMODELLED FOR THEIR
NEEDS ABOVE GROUND AND BELOW OUR BATTALIONS IN THE SALIENT WHERE
THE UNMOLESTED GERMAN AEROPLANES BOMBED THEM KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT
IN THE PHRASE OF THE MOMENT EVERYTHING HAD GONE SOUTH AND OUR
LISTENINGPOSTS IN THE FRONT LINE ROUND YPRES COULD TELL VERY FAIRLY
WHEN A GERMAN DEMONSTRATION WAS PROMPTED BY NATURAL VICE OR ORDERS
TO COVER A NOISY WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR GUNS IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT
DID NOT NEED PLACARDS IN ENGLISH COME ON WE ARE READY FOR YOU
WHICH WERE HOISTED IN SOME OF THE GERMAN TRENCHES ON THAT SOMME FRONT
TO MAKE MEN WISER THAN THEY HAD BEEN FOR WEEKS PAST

SIDE BY SIDE WITH THIS ELABORATE AND PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE PLUS A
MULTITUDE OF CAMPRUMOURS EVEN MORE CIRCUMSTANTIAL WAS THE IMMENSE
INCURIOUSNESS THAT ALWAYS EXISTS IN VETERAN ARMIES FRESH DRAFTS
WOULD POUR OUT FROM ENGLAND FILLED WITH VAIN QUESTIONS AND THE
HOPE OF THAT IMMEDIATE OPEN WARFARE SO WIDELY ADVERTISED TO BE
TOLD THEY WOULD KNOW ALL ABOUT IT WHEN THEIR TURN CAME AND THAT
MEANTIME DEEP TRENCHES WERE NOT BAD THINGS AFTER ALL WHEN THEY
HAD LOOKED FOR A LITTLE ON THE FULL FACE OF WAR THEY WERE CONTENT
TO COPY THEIR ELDERS AND ASK NO QUESTIONS THEY UNDERSTOOD IT WAS
TO BE A WEARINGOUT BATTLE VERY MANY MEN HAD ALREADY BEEN WORN OUT
AND CAST ASIDE IN THE MERE DETAIL OF PREPARATION IN BUILDING THE
LIGHT AND BROADGAUGE RAILWAYS OF SUPPLY AND THE ROADS BESIDE THEM
IN FETCHING UP AND INSTALLING TIMBER HUTMENTS HANGARS TELEPHONES
HOSPITALS PIPELINES FOR WATER AND THE THOUSAND OTHER NECESSITIES
OF MECHANICAL WAR AS IT HAPPENED TO INDIVIDUALS SO THEY KNEW
WOULD IT BE WITH THE BATTALIONS BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS OF ALL THE
ARMIES WHICH GENERAL RAWLINSON ON THE 1ST OF JULY MOVED UP AGAINST
THAT FORTRESS OF A WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE CALLED IN HISTORY THE SOMME

AND WHILE THAT STORM GATHERED AND BROKE THE BATTALION WENT ON WITH
ITS HORRIBLE NECESSARY WORK IN THE SALIENT TILL THE HOUR SHOULD COME
FOR IT AND ITS DIVISION TO BE CAST INTO THE FURNACE AND USED UP WITH
THE REST

ON THE 7TH JULY THEY MOVED AS A SUPPORT TO THE BROKEN AND FILTHY
BANKS OF THE CANAL NORTH OF YPRES AND SAT IN DUGOUTS CONNECTED BY
A TUNNEL AND BEGIRT WITH WATER AND MUD EXCEPT FOR A MERE NIGHTLY
FATIGUE OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MEN THE DIARY NOTED THAT THERE
WAS NO TRAINING POSSIBLE BUT THERE WAS LITTLE SHELLING THE 2ND
GRENADIERS WERE IN THE LINE WHICH THE BATTALION RELIEVED 11TH JULY
ON A BROKEN AND MARSHY FRONT BETWEEN BUFFS ROAD AND FORWARD COTTAGE
WITH BATTALION HEADQUARTERS NEAR ST JEAN AND THE 3RD COLDSTREAM ON
THEIR LEFT THEY WERE SHELLED DURING RELIEF WHEN LIEUTENANT CHRISTY
WHO BUT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HAD JUST ESCAPED A SNIPERS BULLET
THROUGH THE LOOPHOLE WAS KILLED

THAT SAME MORNING FOUR GERMANS WORMED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE RANK
GRASS AND BROKEN GROUND AND FOR A WHILE ALMOST CAPTURED AN ISOLATED
POST OF SIX MEN OF NO 1 COMPANY THEY TRIED INDEED TO MARCH THEM
OFF AS PRISONERS BUT THE IRISH EDGED AWAY UNDER COVER OF THE NEXT
PLATOONS FIRE AND ALL GOT BACK SAFELY THE DAY CLOSED WITH HEAVY
BOMBARDMENTS FROM 59S AN OFFICER AND THREE OTHER RANKS KILLED AND
SEVENTEEN WOUNDED WERE COUNTED AS A LIGHT CASUALTYLIST CONSIDERING
THE BAD COVER NO MAN COULD STAND UPRIGHT FOR AN INSTANT AND ALL
REPAIRS PARAPETS AND DRAINAGE WORK WERE DONE AT NIGHT STOOPING AND
CRAWLING BETWEEN SPURTS OF MACHINEGUN HOSEWORK

THE 13TH JULY WAS ANOTHER LIGHT DAY WITH BUT SEVEN MEN WOUNDED
SECOND LIEUTENANT G V WILLIAMS JOINED FROM THE BASE AND MAJOR C F
FLEMING WENT SICK ON THE 14TH THE SECTOR BEING RATHER TOO ACTIVE AND
NOISY OF NIGHTS JUST THEN A PATROL UNDER LIEUTENANT J N MARSHALL
WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT THE ENEMY MIGHT INTEND IN THE WAY OF DIGGING A
SAP ACROSS NO MANS LAND THE LIEUTENANT WAS WOUNDED IN THE SIDE
AS HE LEFT THE TRENCH BUT INSISTED ON DOING HIS WORK AND WAS OUT
TWO HOURS FOR WHICH HE PAID BY HAVING TO GO INTO HOSPITAL A MONTH
LATER THEIR CASUALTIES ON THE 15TH WHEN THEY WERE RELIEVED BY THE
2ND GRENADIERS AND WENT BACK TO THEIR DUGOUTS BY THE CANAL WERE
FIVE WOUNDED ONE OF WHOM DIED OUT OF THIS TENSE LIFE WERE SUDDENLY
CHOSEN AN OFFICER AND TWENTY MEN TO FORM PART OF THE CONTINGENT
REPRESENTING OUR ARMIES AT THE FRENCH REVIEW IN PARIS ON THE 14TH
JULY THEY WERE CHIEFLY VETERANS OF 1914 AND UNDER CAPTAIN J S N
FITZGERALD THEN OF THE 2ND BATTALION REPAIRED TO A BRIGHT CLEAN
CITY WHERE A MAN COULD HOLD UP HIS HEAD WALKING IN UNCHOKED STREETS
BETWEEN ROOFED AND GLAZED HOUSES AND THE DAY AFTER THE GLITTERING
AFFAIR WAS OVER THEY RETURNED TO THEIR BRICKHEAPS AND BURROWS IN THE
FLANDERS MIRE

ON THE BATTALIONS NEXT TURN JULY 1822 SUSPECTING THAT THE ENEMY
MIGHT BE NEWLY RELIEVED OUR PATROLS WORKED HARD NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
TO CATCH PRISONERS FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES 2346 LANCECORPORAL
HENNIGAN A REGIMENTAL CHARACTER AND A MAN OF STRONG POWERS OF
LEADERSHIP WITH 5743 PRIVATE OBRIEN OF WHOM TOO MANY TALES ARE
TOLD WERE MARKED AS VERY PROMINENT IN THE WORK BUT THE GERMANS
TOOK GREAT CARE NOT TO LEAVE MEN OR CORPSES ABOUT AND THEY GOT
NOTHING FOR THEIR TOIL

ON THE 23RD JULY ORDERS CAME THAT THEIR EXPECTED TERM OF REST WAS TO
BE CANCELLED AS THE DIVISION WOULD GO ELSEWHERE WHICH ALL KNEW
MEANT TOWARDS THE SOMME THERE WERE FIVE DAYS YET ERE THE BATTALION
DREW CLEAR OF THE SALIENT EACH DAY WITH ITS ALMOST UNNOTICED
CASUALTY THAT IN THE LONG RUN MAKES THE BULK OF THE BILLS OF WAR AND
BRINGS HOME THE FACT THAT THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE BATTALION IS DRIPPING
AWAY THE SUPPORT PLATOONS WERE RECKONED LUCKY TO HAVE ONLY ONE MAN
KILLED ON THE 23RD AFTER BOMBARDMENT BY A SIXINCH HIGHEXPLOSIVE
GUN CAPTAIN POLLOK WHO TOOK OVER COMMAND OF NO 1 COMPANY ON
THE SAME DAY WAS WOUNDED TWO DAYS LATER JUST AFTER RELIEF BY A
MACHINEGUN BULLET AND THEIR LAST NORMAL DAY IN THE TRENCHES GAVE
ONE SERGEANT KILLED AND THREE OTHER RANKS WOUNDED

THEY WERE RELIEVED ON THE 27TH JULY AFTER DARK AS USUAL BY THE
1ST ROYAL WARWICKS RECENTLY COME FROM THE SOUTH HAVING BEEN IN
THE FIGHTING THERE THE WARWICKS KNEW THE SOMME THEY LOOKED ON
THE CLEAN CREOSOTED DEEPBAYED HIGHPARAPETED TRENCHES THEY WERE
TO HOLD AND ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD FEEL CUSHY IN SUCH A LINE
CUSHY SAID THE BRIGADE WAIT TILL YOUVE HAD TO LIVE IN EM
BUT SAID THE WARWICKS YOU SEE WEVE BEEN FIGHTING THE LARGE
GUARDSMEN LOOKED AT THE LITTLE WORN LINESMEN AND SWALLOWED IT IN
SILENCE THE 4TH DIVISION TO WHICH THE WARWICKS BELONGED HAD BEEN
PART OF THAT TERRIBLE NORTHERN ATTACK ALONG THE LINE FROM SERRE TO
FRICOURT WHICH HAD SPENT ITSELF IN VAIN AGAINST THE GERMAN DEFENCE
A MONTH BEFORE AND HAD BEEN GROUND AND MILLED DAY BY DAY SINCE BUT
ALL THAT THE DIARY NOTICES IS THAT THAT LAST RELIEF WAS CARRIED OUT
SMOOTHLY AND QUIETLY IN WHAT TO THE WARWICKS AFTER SUCH EXPERIENCE
MUST HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL PEACE

AFTER THEIR THREE WEEKS IN DUGOUTS THE BATTALION RESTED AND WASHED
SOUTH OF MERRY POPERINGHE WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVILY SHELLED AND FOR
SOME DAYS COMPLETELY EVACUATED

BETWEEN MARCH 18 AND JULY 18 EXCLUDING FOUR WEEKS IN REST THEY HAD
LOST FOUR OFFICERS AND THIRTY OTHER RANKS KILLED FIVE OFFICERS AND A
HUNDRED AND FIFTYTHREE OTHER RANKS WOUNDEDA TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED
AND NINETYTWO IN THE MERE ROUTINE OF THE SLOW DAYS

THERE WAS A SAYING OF THE WAR NO ONE NOTICES WEATHER IN THE FRONT
LINE AND IT IS CURIOUS THAT SO SOON AS THE BATTALION WAS ABOVE
GROUND WALKING UNDER NAKED SKIES WITH LIGHT AND AIR ALL ROUND
IT MEN DWELT ON WEATHER AS ALMOST A NEW DISCOVERY THEY FOUND IT
HOT WHEN THE DIVISION ENTRAINED AT PROVEN FOR ST POL FORTYTWO
TRAINS TOOK THE DIVISION AND FORTYSEVEN LORRIES BORE THE BATTALION
ITSELF FROM ST POL TO BOUQUEMAISON ON THE DOULLENS ROAD THERE
HEADQUARTERS WERE IN AN ORCHARD BENEATH UNBARKED TREES WITH LEAVES ON
THE BRANCHES AND A BACKGROUND OF GUNVOICES FROM THE SOMME TO REMIND
THE MEN WHO LAUGHED AND TALKED IN THAT SHADOW AND SUN WHAT WAITED FOR
THEM AFTER THIS SHORT RETURN TO REAL LIFE

THEY MOVED ON THE 4TH AUGUST TO VAUCHELLESLESAUTHIES THE
MATCHBOARD HUTS OF WHICH ON THE TRAMPLED GROUND HAVE BEEN LIKENED
TO A DEMOBBED POULTRY SHOW IT LAY JUST OFF THE WELLWORN
DOULLENSALBERT ROAD NOW FLOODED WITH A STEADY CURRENT OF TROOPS
AND MATERIAL THEY WAITED THERE FOR TEN DAYS DURING THAT TIME 2ND
LIEUTENANT COOK 4TH CONNAUGHT RANGERS LIEUTENANT T BUTLERSTONEY
FROM THE ENTRENCHING BATTALION AND LIEUTENANT N BUTLER FROM
HOSPITAL JOINED THEM

THE REGIMENTAL BAND ARRIVED FROM ENGLAND FOR A THREE MONTHS TOUR
THE OFFICER WHO ACCOMPANIED IT WORE A WOUNDSTRIPETHE VERY FIRST
WHICH THE BATTALION COLLECTIVELY HAD EVER SEENAND MEN WONDERED
WHETHER WOUNDSTRIPES WOULD BECOME COMMON AND HOW MANY ONE MIGHT
ACCUMULATE IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE OFFICER BY LAUGHING FRIENDS AS
A MATTER SOMETHING TOO SUGGESTIVE IN PRESENT COMPANY AND THE BAND
PLAYED IN THE STILL WARM EVENINGS WHILE THE DUST OF FEET GOING
SOMMEWARD ROSE AND STRETCHED UNBROKEN ALONG THE DOULLENSALBERT
PAV HERE THE VERY TREEBOLES BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO BE STRIPPED AND
SPLINTERED BY SHELLFIRE WERE WORN AND RUBBED BENEATH THE TOUCH OF
MENS SHOULDERS AND GNAWED BY THE HALTED HORSES

THE KING CAME ON THE 9TH AUGUST TO VISIT THE DIVISION SPECIAL
ARRANGEMENTS WERE IMPOSSIBLE SO BOMBINGASSAULT PRACTICE WENT
ON WHILE THE OFFICERS OF THE BATTALION WERE PRESENTED TO HIM IN
THE ORCHARD WHERE THE MESSES WERE PITCHED HE MADE NO ORATIONS
UTTERED NO THREATS AGAINST HIS ENEMIES NOR GUARANTEED THE PERSONAL
ASSISTANCE OF ANY TRIBAL GOD HIS REGIMENTS MERELY TURNED OUT AND
CHEERED THE INCONSPICUOUS CAR AS LONG AS THEY COULD SEE IT BUT THERE
IS A STORY THAT A FRENCHMAN AN OLD ROYALIST IN WHOSE WOOD SOME
OFFICERS HAD RIGGED A TEMPORARY HUT OF WHICH HE HIGHLY DISAPPROVED
WITHDREW EVERY CLAIM AND COMPLAINT ON THE PROMISE THAT THE CHAIR IN
WHICH THE KING OF ENGLAND HAD SAT SHOULD BE HANDED OVER TO HIM DULY
CERTIFICATED WHICH WAS DONE

ON THE 11TH THE BRIGADE MOVED OVER THE OPEN COUNTRY VIA LOUVENCOURT
AND BERTRANCOURT TO THE WOODS SOUTH OF MAILLYMAILLET A SIXMILE
MARCH IN HOT AND DUSTY WEATHER AND THE BRIGADE 2ND GRENADIERS
3RD COLDSTREAM 2ND COLDSTREAM IN RESERVE AND 1ST IRISH GUARDS IN
SUPPORT TOOK OVER TRENCHES EAST OF ENGLEBELMER AND WELL WITHIN THE
SHELL AREA THIEPVAL AND THE SCHWABEN REDOUBT ACROSS THE ANCRE WERE
ONLY A THOUSAND YARDS AWAY AND UNSUBDUED AND FOR A WHILE IT LOOKED
AS THOUGH THAT WEARY CORNER OF DEATH WAS TO BE THE GUARDS OBJECTIVE
BUT NEXT DAY ORDERS CAME TO MOVE OUT OF THE LINE AGAIN BACK TO
HIGH AND BREEZY LOUVENCOURT IN WARM RAIN TAKING OVER BILLETS FROM
THE 2ND SHERWOOD FORESTERS AND BY IMMENSE GOOD LUCK COMING ACROSS
A HEAVENSENT EXPEDITIONARY FORCE CANTEEN A THING NOT OFTEN FOUND
IN FRONTLINE BILLETS UPON THIS PAY WAS AT ONCE ARRANGED FOR AND
EVERY ONE SHOPPED AT LARGE THE INCIDENT STAYED IN THEIR MINDS LONG
AFTER THE DETAILS OF MERE BATTLES WERE FORGOTTEN AND THAT CANTEEN
AT LOUVENCOURT IS A LANDMARK OF OLD MEMORIES

BY THIS DATE THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME WAS SIX WEEKS OLD AND OUR
TROOPS HAD EATEN SEVERALIN SOME PLACES AS MUCH AS FIVE OR
SIXTHOUSAND YARDS DEEP INTO THE AREA TWO MAIN ATTACKS HAD BEEN
DELIVEREDTHAT OF THE 1ST JULY WHICH HAD LASTED TILL THE 14TH
AND THAT OF THE 14TH WHICH WENT ON TILL THE END OF THE MONTH
FROM SERRE TO OVILLERSLABOISELLE THE GERMANS FRONT STOOD FAST
FROM OVILLERSLABOISELLE TO THE JUNCTION WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES
AT HARDECOURT THE FIRST TREMENDOUS SYSTEM OF THEIR DEFENCE HAD
BEEN TAKEN LITERALLY A FEW SCORE YARDS AT A TIME TRENCH BY TRENCH
VILLAGE BY VILLAGE QUARRY BY QUARRY AND COPSE BY COPSE LOST WON
AND HELD AGAIN FROM THREE TO EIGHT OR NINE TIMES A SURGE FORWARD
ON SOME PART OF THE LINE MIGHT SUCCEED IN MAKING GOOD A FEW HUNDRED
YARDS OF GAIN WITHOUT TOO HEAVY LOSS AN ISOLATED ATTACK NECESSARY
TO CLEAR A FLANK OR TO STRUGGLE TOWARDS SOME POINT OF LARGER COMMAND
WITHERED UNDER ENORMOUS FAR CONCENTRATIONS OF ENEMY GUNS EVEN AS
THE WOODS WITHERED TO SNAPPED CHARRED STICKAGE AT EVERY STEP AND
TURN HOSTS OF MACHINEGUNS AT GROUNDLEVEL SWEPT AND SHAVED THE
FORLORN LANDSCAPES AND WHEN THE UTMOST HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE DAY
THE DISPLACED GERMANS SEEMED ALWAYS TO OCCUPY THE CREST OF SOME YET
HIGHER DOWN VILLAGES AND WOODS VANISHED IN THE TAKING WERE STAMPED
INTO OR BLOWN OUT OF THE GROUND LEAVING ONLY THEIR IMPERISHABLE
NAMES SO IN THE COURSE OF INCONCEIVABLE WEEKS FELL MAMETZ AND THE
RANKED WOODS BEHIND IT CONTALMAISON MONTAUBAN AND CATERPILLAR
WOOD BERNAFAY TRNES WOOD LONGUEVAL AND THE FRINGE OF DELVILLE
EVEN THEN A CHARNELHOUSE AMONG SHATTERED STUMPS BOTH BAZENTINS
AND POZIRES OF THE AUSTRALIANS THE FEW DECENCIES AND ACCOMMODATIONS
OF THE OLD SETTLED TRENCHLIFE WERE GONE MEN LIVED AS BEST THEY
COULD IN THE OPEN AMONG ETERNAL SHELLHOLES AND MOUNDS OF HEAPED
RUBBISH THAT WERE LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT TO BE DISPERSED AFRESH UNDER
CONSTANT MENACE OF GAS BLINDED WITH THE SMOKESCREENS OF LOCAL
ATTACKS AND BEATEN DOWN FROM EVERY POINT OF THE COMPASS EITHER
BY ENEMY FIRE SUDDENLY GATHERED AND LOOSED OR THAT OF THEIR OWN
HEAVIES SEARCHING FROM MILES OFF SOME NEWLY CLEARED HOLLOW OR
SKYLINE OF THE UPLANDS WHERE OUR TROOPS LAY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM
THE SKINNED EARTH

BATTALIONS BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS WENT INTO THE FIGHT WERE WORN
DOWN IN MORE OR IN LESS TIME PRECISELY AS THE CHANCES OF THE GROUND
EITHER SCREENED OR EXPOSED THEM FOR A WHILE TO THE FIREBLASTS
SOMETIMES IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF HOURS BEFORE WHAT HAD BEEN A
BRIGADE CEASED TO EXISTHAD SOAKED HORRIBLY INTO THE GROUND THE
WASTAGE WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND BACK ACROSS THE SHELLHOLES AS WELL
AS MIGHT BE LOSSES WERE MADE GOOD AND WITH A HALF TWO THIRDS
OR THREE QUARTERS NEW DRAFTS THE ORIGINAL BATTALION CLIMBED
BACK TO ITS TASK WHILE SOME DEVELOPMENT BEHIND THE NEXT FOLD OF
LAND WAS IN PROGRESS OR BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL THEY WOULD BE
CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE LIFEANDDEATH GEOGRAPHY OF THE FEW HUNDRED
YARDS IMMEDIATELY ABOUT THEM OR THOSE FEW SCORE YARDS OVER WHICH
PROFITABLE ADVANCES COULD BE MADE A DAY EVEN AN HOUR LATER THE
USE AND VALUE OF THEIR OWN HOLLOW OR RIDGE MIGHT BE ALTOGETHER
ABOLISHED WHAT HAD BEEN A HARDLY WON FOOTHOLD WOULD BECOME THE VERY
PIVOT OF A CENTRAL ATTACK OR SUBSIDE INTO A SHELTERED HAVEN OF
REFUGE AS THE NEXT DOMINATING RIDGE OR LAP OF THE LARGEBONED FRENCH
LANDSCAPE WAS CLEARED EQUALLY SUDDENLY EVEN WHILE THE MEN THANKED
GOD FOR THEIR RESPITE GERMAN BATTERIES OR A SUDDENLY PUSHEDFORTH
CHAIN OF GERMAN MACHINEGUNS WOULD POUND OR SPRAY THEIR SHELTER INTO
EXPOSED TORMENT ONCE MORE

AS ONE PHILOSOPHER OF THAT UNEARTHLY EPOCH PUT IT SOME TIME
AFTERWARDS WE WAS LIKE FLEAS IN A BLANKET YELL UNDERSTAND SEEIN
NO MORE THAN THE NEXT NEAREST WRINKLE BUT JERRY AND OUR GENERALS
YELL UNDERSTAND THEY KEPT US HOPPIN

OUR GENERALS WHO IT MAY BE PRESUMED KNEW ALL THE WRINKLES OF
THE BLANKET SHIFTED THE BRIGADE ON THE 16TH AUGUST OPPOSITE SERRE
ON THE FAR LEFT OF THE LINE WHICH WAS NOT DESTINED TO BE PIERCED
TILL THE NEXT YEAR IT WAS A FLEETING TRANSFER TO ANOTHER ARMY CORPS
THEIR OWN THE FOURTEENTH UNDER LORD CAVAN HAVING JOINED THE FOURTH
ARMY THEY TOOK OVER FROM THE SOMERSET LI 61ST BRIGADE A SET OF
TRENCHES WHICH AFTER THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE SALIENT STRUCK THEM
AS DRY DEEP AND GOOD BUT ODD AND UNHOMELY THEY HAD BEEN FRENCH
WERE FROM SIX TO NINE FEET DEEP PAVED IN PLACES WITH STONE WHICH
OUR MEN HAD NEVER SEEN IN TRENCHES BEFORE AND REVETTED WITH STRANGE
FRENCH STICKWORK THE DUGOUTS TOO WERE NOT OF THEIR STANDARD
PATTERNS THE FRONT LINE WAS BADLY BATTERED BUT RELIEFS COULD BE
EFFECTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WITHOUT CASUALTIES THE ACTIVITIES AND
COMFORTING PRESENCE OF OUR AEROPLANES IMPRESSED THEM ALSO AS A GREAT
CONTRAST TO YPRES WHERE NATURALLY OUR TROOPS FOR THE MOMENT HELD
ONLY A WATCHINGBRIEF AND EVERY MACHINE THAT COULD BE SPARED HAD GONE
TO THE SOMME THE DEAD OF THE OPENING BATTLES LAY THICK ABOUT THE
PLACE THE IRISH BURIED TWO HUNDRED OF A DIVISION THAT HAD PASSED
THAT WAY FIVE WEEKS OR SO BEFORE AND SALVED WITH AMAZEMENT AT
ITS PLENTY THE WRECKAGE OF THEIR EQUIPMENT THERES THE WORLD
AND ALL OUT THERE SORR SAID A MAN RETURNING FROM HIS WORK THE
VERY WORLD AN ALL MACHINEGUNS ANDHIS VOICE DROPPING IN SHEER
AWERUMJARS THEY WERE UNMOLESTED SAVE BY A FEW MINENWERFERS
UNDERTAKERS WORK DOES NOT HEARTEN ANY TROOPS AND THEY WERE GLAD TO
GET BACK TO HUTMENTS IN THE UNTOUCHED WOODS BEHIND AUTHIE NEAR THEIR
OLD POULTRYSHOW DURING THESE DAYS 2ND LIEUTENANTS J N WARD
AND T GIBSON JOINED FROM HOME THE LATTER GOING TO THE FIRSTLINE
TRANSPORT AND CAPTAIN L R HARGREAVES TOOK OVER NO 2 COMPANY ON
JOINING FROM HOME ON THE 20TH

ON THE 23RD AUGUST THEY MOVED WITH THE BRIGADE ACROSS TO BEAUVAL ON
THE DOULLENSAMIENS ROAD WHERE CAMPS AND HUTMENTS ALMOST TOUCHED
EACH OTHER AND ON THE 25TH EMBARKED AT CANAPLES IN A HORROR CALLED
A TACTICAL TRAIN WHICH WAS STUFFED WITH TWO THOUSAND OF THEIR
BRIGADE AFTER SLOW AND SPASMODIC EFFORTS IT BORE THEM QUITE FIFTY
KILOMETRES IN SEVEN HOURS TO MRICOURT LABB WHENCE THEY MARCHED TO
MAULTE IN A GREEN HOLLOW UNDER THE DOWNS AND FOUND THEMSELVES ONCE
MORE IN THEIR OWN FOURTEENTH CORPS UNDER LORD CAVAN MORE IMMEDIATELY
TO THE POINT AND A THING LONG REMEMBERED THEIR BILLETS WERE DAMP
DIRTY AND FULL OF FLEAS THE WEATHER THAT WAS DESTINED TO RUIN THE
CAMPAIGN BROKE IN TORRENTS OF RAIN AND THE CONTINUOUS TRAFFIC OF
STUFF HAD KNOCKED THE VERY BOWELS OUT OF ALL THE HARDWORKED ROADS
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY REALISED WHAT THE GREY CLINGING SOMME
MUD MEANT

THEY TRAINED IN THAT WET AT BOMBING AT ASSAULTING FROM TRENCHES AT
VISUAL SIGNALLING TO AEROPLANES AND AT MARKING OUT TRENCHES BY NIGHT
WITH WHITE TAPES AS SCORES OF THOUSANDS HAD DONE BEFORE THEM WHILE
THE ROAR OF THE GUNS ROSE AND DROPPED WITHOUT EXPLANATION LIKE THE
TUMULT OF UNSEEN CROWDS AND RUMOURS AND CONTRADICTORY ORDERS FOR
STANDING FAST OR LEAVING ON THE INSTANT KEPT THEM IN TENSION FOR TEN
DAYS BUT MOST WONDERFUL OF ALL TO THE MEN FROM THE SALIENT WHERE
SILENCE AND GUARDED MOVEMENT WERE AUTOMATIC WAS THE LOUD LIFE OF
THIS OPENAIR WORLD OF TROOPS AROUND THEMMEN AND GUNS SPREAD OVER
THE BREADTH OF COUNTIESHORSES IN THE OPEN BY THOUSANDS RANKED IN
ENDLESS HORSELINESPROCESSIONS OF ROARING LORRIES AND DEEPRUMBLING
HEAVY GUNS AND ONLY A FEW MILES AWAYTHE WAR IN FULL BLAST IT WAS
POSSIBLE TO CATCH A RIDE IN A LORRY AND GO UP AND SEE THE WAR AS
THE SAYING RAN YONDER BUT A VERY LITTLE WAY STRETCHED HORIZONS
DOWNS AND TABLELANDS AS FAR AS IMAGINATION COULD RANGE ALL THE
FIRMAMENT GROANED TO THE ARTILLERY HIDDEN AND STRIVING WITHIN THEM
AND STATELILY AND REGULARLY AND UNCEASINGLY THE VAST SPACES OF
OPEN WERE PLUMED WITH VERTICAL COLUMNS OF CHANGEFUL SHELLSMOKE
MEN PERCEIVED THAT EVERYTHING THEY HAD KNOWN TILL THEN HAD BEEN A
FIELDDAY HERE WAS THE WAR

A STORY THAT A WONDERFUL NEW WEAPON WOULD SOON APPEAR WAS VERY
GENERAL SOME ONE HAD HALFSEEN OR BEEN TOLD ABOUT THE TANKS IN THEIR
WELLSCREENED SHELTERS ONE OR TWO OVERZEALOUS ENGLISH JOURNALS HAD
BEEN INDUSTRIOUSLY HINTING AT THE DEVELOPMENTS OF SCIENCE THE ENEMY
WAS UNEASY AND GERMANFASHION HAD ISSUED PORTENTOUS INSTRUCTION TO
HIS MEN TO BE ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST SOMETHING BUT HOWEVER SHORT
HIS TRAINING THE BRITISH INFANTRYMAN IS A BORN SCOFFER WE HAD
HEARD ABOUT MOVING FORTS THAT WEIGHED THIRTY TON SAID ONE OF THEM
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE WE KNEW WED HAVE TO TAKE THE THICK O THE
COFFEE

THE LOCAL BATTLES AND OPERATIONS ON THE SOUTHERN STRETCH OF THE
FRONT NOW IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE BATTALION WERE ALMOST AS
INDISTINGUISHABLE AS WAVES ON A BEACH THAT MELT INTO OR RISE OUT OF
EACH OTHER IN THE MAIN FLOOD BUT THERE WAS A FRESH TIDAL MOVEMENT
AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER WHEN OUR WHOLE LINE ATTACKED AGAIN
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FRENCH WE GAINED NOTHING OF ANY ACCOUNT IN
THE NORTH BUT IN THE SOUTH GUILLEMONT FELL AND AFTER DESPERATE
ATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK ALMOST ALL OF GINCHY AND THE WHOLE
THOUSANDYARDSQUARE OF DELVILLE WOOD AND THE SOUTH END OF HIGH WOOD

THE NET RESULT UP TO THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER HAD BEEN TO ADVANCE AND
ESTABLISH THE CENTRE OF OUR LINE ON THE CREST OF THE HIGH GROUND
FROM DELVILLE WOOD TO THE ROAD ABOVE MOUQUET FARM THIEPVAL AND ITS
OUTWORKS STILL UNTAKEN SO THAT WE HAD OBSERVATION OVER THE SLOPES
AHEAD FROM DELVILLE WOOD EASTWARD TO LEUZEHISTORICALLY KNOWN AS
LOUSY WOODOVERLOOKING THE LITTLE TOWN OF COMBLES ON OUR RIGHT
FLANK OUR ADVANCE HELD THE MAIN RIDGE OF LAND THERE BUT HAD NOT
GONE BEYOND IT STILL FARTHER EAST ACROSS THE VALLEY WHERE COMBLES
STOOD THE FRENCH WERE WORKING NORTH ALONG THE HEIGHTS TOWARDS
SAILLYSAILLISEL THREE THOUSAND YARDS AWAY THEIR LINE WAS PINCHED
ON THE RIGHT BY THE BIG ST PIERRE VAAST WOODS FORTIFIED THROUGHOUT
THEIR LEFT WAS ALMOST EQUALLY CONSTRICTED BY THE VALLEY WHERE
COMBLES AMONG ITS QUARRIES AND HIDDEN SHELTERS SQUATTED AND DEALT
DEATH WHICH ALL THE HEIGHTS TO THE NORTHMORVAL LESBUFS AND LE
TRANSLOYJOINED WITH SAILLYSAILLISEL AND ST PIERRE VAAST IN THE
EAST TO MAKE MORE SURE IT WAS NECESSARY THEN TO FREE THE GROUND
AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO ARMIES IN THE DIRECTION OF MORVAL WHICH
COMMANDED FAR TOO COMPLETE A FIRE AND ALSO BEYOND GINCHY TOWARDS
LESBUFS WHERE THE OUTLYING SPURS OF HIGH LAND RAKED LOUSY WOOD

THAT CLEARINGUP A COMPARATIVELY SMALL DETAIL ON A VAST FRONT FELL
TO THE LOT OF THE FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS LORD CAVAN COMMANDING
WHICH LAY BETWEEN GINCHY VILLAGE AND LEUZE WOOD THE CORPS WAS MADE
UP OF THE FIFTYSIXTH LONDON TERRITORIAL DIVISION ON THE EXTREME
RIGHT OR EAST NEXT TO THE FRENCH THE SIXTH DIVISION A LITTLE NORTH
OF LEUZE WOOD FACING THE QUADRILATERAL A VEILED DEFENSIVE WORK AS
STRONG AS AMPLE TIME AND THE GROUND COULD MAKE IT AND DESTINED TO
TURN THE FORTUNES OF THAT DAY AND ON THE LEFT OF THE SIXTH AGAIN
THE GUARDS DIVISION IN FRONT OF WHAT REMAINED OF GINCHY GINCHY FARM
AND ORCHARD ALL STRONGLY HELD BY THE GERMANS AND SOME BATTERED
BRICKFIELDS HARD BY

LORD CAVAN DID NOT OVERSTATE THE CASE IN HIS MESSAGE TO THE GUARDS
DIVISION JUST BEFORE THE ATTACK WHEN HE WROTE THE CORPS COMMANDER
KNOWS THAT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES TO BE CLEARED UP ON THE LEFT AND IN
FRONT OF THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE AND ON THE RIGHT OF THE 2ND GUARDS
BRIGADE BUT THE COMMANDERINCHIEF IS OF OPINION THAT THE GENERAL
SITUATION IS SO FAVOURABLE THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT ETC ETC

A BATTALION LOOKS AT LIFE FROM A MORE LIMITED STANDPOINT BRIGADE
ORDERS ISSUED ON THE 11TH SEPTEMBER ANNOUNCED THE FRENCH ARMY
WILL ATTACK THE ENEMY DEFENCES BETWEEN COMBLES RAVINE AND
MARTINPUICH ON Z DAY WITH THE OBJECT OF SEIZING MORVAL LESBUFS
GUEUDECOURT AND FLERS AND BREAKING THROUGH THE ENEMYS DEFENCES
BUT WHAT INTERESTED THE IRISH WHO PREFER FIGHTING LIGHT EVEN AS
THE FRENCHMAN CAN SHUFFLE INTO ACTION UNDER ALL HIS HIGHPILED
POSSESSIONS WAS THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE TO CARRY UP
THERE IT INCLUDED TWO DAYS RATIONS A COUPLE OF BOMBS TWO EXTRA
BANDOLIERS OF AMMUNITION A PICK OR A SHOVEL AND THREE SANDBAGS
PER MAN PLUS WIRECUTTERS AND OTHER FITTINGS ON THE OTHER HAND
GREATCOATS AND PACKS WERE DISCARDED AND CARDIGAN WAISTCOATS WORN
BENEATH THEIR JACKETS

ON THE 10TH SEPTEMBER THE BATTALION WITH THE 1ST BRIGADE MOVED IN
FROM MAULTE TO THE VALLEY BEHIND CARNOY AND AFTER DARK THAT NIGHT
NOS 3 AND 4 COMPANIES UNDER MAJOR T M D BAILIE WERE ORDERED UP
THROUGH BERNAFAY WOOD TO A LINE OF WHAT PASSED FOR TRENCHES BEHIND
GINCHY AND NEXT MORNING NOS 1 AND 2 CAPTAIN HARGREAVES AND CAPTAIN
RANKIN BIVOUACKED IN SOME OLD TRENCHES AT THE NORTH END OF BERNAFAY
WHERE THEY WERE USED IN CARRYINGFATIGUES FOR THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE
THEN IN THE FRONT LINE THE OTHER TWO COMPANIES WERE HEAVILY SHELLED
IN THEIR GINCHY TRENCHES AND LOST SEVEN KILLED AND THIRTEEN WOUNDED
A BOMBING ACCIDENT IN BIVOUAC THE DAY BEFORE HAD ALSO WOUNDED SIX MEN

ON THE 12TH SEPTEMBER NO 1 COMPANY STATIONED IN A SMALL COPSE NEAR
TRNES WOOD WHICH WAS CHOKED WITH WRECKAGE AND DEAD HAD THREE OF
THEIR LEWISGUNNERS KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED BY A SINGLE SHELL

ON THE 13TH SEPTEMBER THE BATTALION SPENT A QUIET DAY WITH ONLY ONE
KILLED AND SEVEN WOUNDED EXCEPT FOR A DEADLY TIRING FATIGUE OF
CARRYING BOMBS TO GUILLEMONT UNDER SHELLFIRE OUR ARTILLERY BEGAN
ON THE 12TH AND CONTINUED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT MUCH BREAK TILL THE
HOUR OF ADVANCE ON THE 15TH WHEN IT CHANGED TO THE DULY ORDERED
STATIONARY AND CREEPING BARRAGES OF THE FIELDGUNS


THE 15TH SEPTEMBER

ON THE EVENING OF THE 14TH THE 1ST BRIGADE OF GUARDS MOVED OUT
TO THE SHELLHOLES AND FRAGMENTS OF TRENCH THAT FORMED THEIR
ASSEMBLYPOSITIONS ON A FRONT OF FIVE HUNDRED YARDS BETWEEN DELVILLE
WOOD AND THE NORTHERN FLANK OF GINCHY THERE IT LAY IN THE COLD WITH
THE OTHERS TILL ZERO 620 A M OF THE 15TH THE 2ND AND 3RD
COLDSTREAM HAD THE FRONT LINE FOR THEY WERE TO LEAD THE ATTACK
THE 2ND GRENADIERS LAY BEHIND TO SUPPORT THEM AND CONSOLIDATE
THE FIRST OBJECTIVEA LINE OF TRENCH ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED YARDS
NORTHEASTAND TO HOLD IT TILL THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS CAME UP AND
HAD PASSED THROUGH THEM THEN IF THE FLANKS WERE SECURE THE 2ND
GRENADIERS WERE TO COME ON AND SUPPORT IN TURN THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS
WERE TO PASS THROUGH THE 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM AFTER THE LATTER
BATTALIONS HAD REACHED THE THIRD OBJECTIVE ANOTHER LINE OF TRENCH
TWENTYFIVE HUNDRED YARDS OFF AND WERE THENCE TO GO AND TAKE THE
FINAL OBJECTIVETHE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF LESBUFS THIRTYFIVE
HUNDRED YARDS FROM THEIR JUMPINGOFF PLACE THERE WAS A LIMITED
OBJECTIVE THREE HUNDRED YARDS BEYOND THE FIRST WHICH WORKED IN WITH
THE ADVANCE TOWARDS FLERS OF THE DIVISIONS ON THE LEFT OF THE GUARDS
FROM DELVILLE WOOD TO MARTINPUICH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CONCERN ONLY
THE BATTALION 2ND COLDSTREAM ON THE LEFT FLANK OF THE 1ST BRIGADE

INCIDENTALLY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT AS SOON AS ALL THE OBJECTIVES HAD
BEEN SEIZED CAVALRY WOULD ADVANCE AND SEIZE THE HEIGHTS AHEAD

THE BATTALION FORMED UP NORTHWEST OF GINCHY IN TWO LINES FACING

BUT WHICH SEEMED ENDLESS THEY FELT ONE MAN AVERRED LIKE AMATEUR
ACTORS UPON WHOM THE CURTAIN UNEXPECTEDLY RISES THE ENEMY NOT
LOOKING FOR THE ATTACK WERE ONLY EXPENDING OCCASIONAL SHOTS WHICH
EMPHASISED THE AWFUL LONELINESS AND EXPOSURE OF IT ALL TILL WITH
A WRENCH THAT JERKED THE GROUND OUR BARRAGE OPENED THE ENEMYS
COUNTERBARRAGE REPLIED AND THROUGH A HAZE OF FLYING DIRT NO 1
COMPANY OF THE IRISH SAW A PLATOON OF COLDSTREAM IN FRONT OF THEM
CRUMPED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN ONE FLASH AND ROAR AFTER THAT THE
LINES MOVED INTO A BLIZZARD OF SHELL AND MACHINEGUN FIRE WHERE ALL
LANDMARKS WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE IN THE UPHEAVAL OF EXPLOSIVES WE
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TRIED TO GUIDE OURSELVES BY THE WAVES OF THE
SEATHE WAY THEY SPOUTED UP

THERE NATURALLY CANNOT BE ANY DEFINITE OR ACCURATE RECORD OF THE
DAYS WORK EVEN HAD MAPS BEEN ISSUED TO THE OFFICERS A WEEK INSTEAD
OF A DAY OR SO BEFORE THE ATTACK EVEN HAD THOSE MAPS MARKED ALL
KNOWN DANGERPOINTSSUCH AS THE GINCHYFLERS SUNK ROAD EVEN HAD
THE KALEIDOSCOPIC INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THE BROWN AND YELLOW LINES BEEN
MORE INTELLIGIBLE OR HAD THE VILLAGE OF GINCHY BEEN DISTINGUISHABLE
FROM A MAP OF THE PITTED MOONONCE THE AFFAIR WAS LAUNCHED THERE
WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF SEEING FAR OR LIVING LONG THE TWO LEADING
PLATOONS OF NO 3 COMPANY FOLLOWING THE COLDSTREAM CHARGED THROUGH
THE RIPPING FIRE THAT CAME OUT OF GINCHY ORCHARD TO THE GERMAN
FIRSTLINE TRENCH WHICH RAN FROM THE SUNKEN ROAD AT THAT POINT
THE OTHERS CAME BEHIND THEM CHEERING THEIR WAY INTO THE SLEET OF
MACHINEGUN FIRE THE TRUE LINE OF ADVANCE WAS NORTHEASTERLY BUT
THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE ON THE RIGHT OF THE 1ST CAUGHT VERY HEAVILY
BY THE GERMAN BARRAGE ON THEIR RIGHT FLANK CLOSED IN TOWARDS THE
1ST BRIGADE AND EDGED IT MORE NORTHWARD SO THAT ABOUT AN HOUR AND
A HALF AFTER THE ADVANCE BEGAN WHAT THE COUNTLESS MACHINEGUNS HAD
LEFT OF THE IRISH FOUND ITSELF WITH THREE OUT OF ITS FOUR COMPANY
COMMANDERS ALREADY CASUALTIES ALL OFFICERS OF NO 2 COMPANY OUT
OF ACTION AND THE SECOND IN COMMAND MAJOR T M D BAILIE
KILLED THEY WERE HELD UP UNDER HEAVY SHELLING EITHER IN FRONT
OF GERMAN WIRE OR APPROXIMATELY ON THE FIRSTLINE OBJECTIVEA
BATTERED GERMAN TRENCH WHICH OUR ARTILLERY HAD DONE ITS BEST TO
OBLITERATE BUT FORTUNATELY HAD FAILED IN PARTS WITH THE IRISH WERE
REPRESENTATIVES OF EVERY UNIT OF THE 1ST AND 2ND BRIGADES MOSTLY
LACKING OFFICERS AND SOME FRESH TROOPS OF THE FOURTEENTH DIVISION
FROM THE LEFT OF THE LINE OUTSIDE THEIR AREA THE SIXTH DIVISIONS
ATTACKS BETWEEN GINCHY TELEGRAPH AND LEUZE WOOD HAD FAILED THANKS TO
A DRIVING FIRE FROM THE QUADRILATERAL THE GREAT FORTIFIED WORK THAT
CONTROLLED THE LANDSCAPE FOR A MILE AND A HALF SO THE RIGHT FLANK OF
THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS LEFT IN THE AIR THE ENEMY ZEALOUSLY TRYING
TO TURN ITBOMB VERSUS BAYONET

JUDGMENT OF TIME AND DISTANCE HAD GONE WITH THE STRESS AND ROAR
AROUND THE TWO ATTACKING BATTALIONS 2ND AND 3RD COLDSTREAM OF THE
1ST BRIGADE HAD MORE OR LESS GONE TOOWERE EITHER DEAD OR DISPERSED
INTO SMALL PARTIES DODGING AMONG SMOKING SHELLHOLES THE OTHERS
WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAD WON AT LEAST TWO OF THE
THREE OBJECTIVESAN ERROR DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAD FOUND AND
FOUGHT OVER A TRENCH FULL OF ENEMY WHERE NO SUCH OBSTACLE HAD BEEN
INDICATED SUDDENLY A PARTY OF SNIPERS AND MACHINEGUNS APPEARED
BEHIND THE IRISH IN A COMMUNICATIONTRENCH FIRED AT LARGE AS MUCH
OUT OF BEWILDERMENT AS DESIGN WOUNDED THE SOLE SURVIVING COMPANY
OFFICER OF THE FOUR COMPANIES LIEUTENANT J K GREER AND OWING
TO THE JAMMING OF OUR LEWISGUNS GOT AWAY TO BE KILLED ELSEWHERE A
MASS OF SURRENDERING GERMANS DISTURBED BY THE ADVANCE OF A DIVISION
ON THE LEFT DRIFTED ACROSS THEM AND FURTHER BLINDED THE SITUATION
NOBODY KNEW WITHIN HUNDREDS OF YARDS WHERE THEY WERE BUT SINCE IT
WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE WHOLE ATTACK OF THE DIVISION PRESSED AFTER THE
FAILURE OF THE SIXTH DIVISION BY THE FIRE FROM THE QUADRILATERAL
HAD SHEERED TOO FAR TOWARDS THE LEFT OR NORTH THE NEED OF THE MOMENT
WAS TO SHIFT THE MEN OF THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE BACK ALONG THE TRENCH
TOWARDS THEIR OWN AREA TO SORT OUT THE MIXED MASS OF OFFICERLESS MEN
ON THE LEFT AND TO MAKE THEM DIG IN BEFORE THE VICIOUS SPASMODIC
SHELLING OF THE CONGESTED LINE TURNED INTO THE FULL ROLL OF THE
GERMAN BARRAGE

THEY CLEARED OUT AS BEST THEY COULD THE MIXED ENGLISH AND GERMAN
BODIES THAT PAVED THE BOTTOM OF THE TRENCH AND TOILED DESPERATELY
AT THE WRECKAGESPLINTERS AND CONCRETE FROM BLOWNIN DUGOUTS
EARTHSLIDES AND COLLAPSES OF HEADCOVER BY YARDS AT A TIME ALL
MINGLED OR BESMEARED WITH HORRORS AND FILTH THAT A SHELL WOULD
SUDDENLY INCREASE UNDER THEIR HANDS MEN COULD GIVE HIDEOUS ISOLATED
EXPERIENCES OF THEIR OWNIT SEEMED TO EACH SURVIVOR THAT HE HAD
WORKED FOR A LIFETIME IN A WORLD APARTBUT NO MAN COULD RECALL
ANY CONNECTED ORDER OF EVENTS AND THE EXACT HOUR AND SURROUNDINGS
WHEREIN SUCH AND SUCH A MANPRIVATE NCO OR OFFICERMET HIS
DEATH ARE STILL IN DISPUTE IT WAS A STILL DAY AND THE REEKING
CHEMICALTAINTED FOG OF THE HIGH EXPLOSIVES WOULD NOT CLEAR ORDERS
WOULD BE GIVEN AND TAKEN BY MEN SUDDENLY APPEARING AND AS SUDDENLY
VANISHING THROUGH SMOKE OR ACROSS FALLEN EARTH TILL BOTH WOULD
BE CUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE BY A RIFLE BULLET OR BEATEN DOWN BY THE
STAMP AND VOMIT OF A SHELL THERE WAS TOO ALWAYS A CROWD OF MEN
SEATED OR IN FANTASTIC ATTITUDES SILENT WITH SET ABSORBED FACES
BUSILY ENGAGED IN TRYING TO TIE UP STAUNCH OR PLUG THEIR OWN
WOUNDSTO SAVE THEIR OWN SINGLE LIVES WITH THEIR OWN HANDS WHEN
ORDERS CAME TO THESE THEY WOULD SHAKE THEIR HEADS IMPATIENTLY AND GO
ON WITH THEIR URGENT HORRIBLE BUSINESS OTHERS BEYOND HOPE BUT
NOT CONSCIOUSNESS LAMENTED THEMSELVES INTO DEATH THE DIARY COVERS
THESE EXPERIENCES OF THE THREE HOURS BETWEEN 8 A M AND 11 A M
WITH THE WORDS IN THE MEANTIME DESPITE RATHER HEAVY SHELLING A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONSOLIDATION WAS DONE ON THE TRENCH WHILE THE
WORK OF REORGANIZATION WAS CONTINUED IN THE MEANTIME ALSO SOME
OF THE COLDSTREAM BATTALIONS MIXED WITH A FEW MEN OF THE IRISH
GUARDS THE LATTER COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT W MUMFORD HAD RUSHED
ON INTO THE WILDERNESS BEYOND THE TRENCH TOWARDS THE BROWN LINE OR
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BROWN LINE THREE HUNDRED YARDS OR SO
AHEAD AND FOR THE MOMENT HAD BEEN LOST ABOUT HALFPAST ELEVEN THE
COMMANDING OFFICER THE ADJUTANT AND 2ND LIEUTENANT G V WILLIAMS
AND LIEUTENANT L C WHITEFOORD OF THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE MACHINEGUN
COMPANY WHO REPRESENTED ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE OFFICERS WENT
FORWARD WITH ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE IRISH GUARDS AND ALL AVAILABLE
NOT TOO BADLY WOUNDED COLDSTREAMERS TOWARDS THE NEXT OBJECTIVE
EVERY ONE WAS GLAD TO STEP OUT FROM THE SICKENING TRENCH INTO THE
WIRETRAPPED SHELLPLOUGHED OPEN WHENCE THE WORST OF THE GERMAN
BARRAGE HAD LIFTED THOUGH ENEMY MACHINEGUNS WERE CROPPING IT
IRREGULARLY THEIR ROAD LAY UPHILL THROUGH A FIELD OF RANK UNWEEDED
STUFF AND WHEN THEY HAD TOPPED A LITTLE RISE THEY SAW WHAT SEEMED
BY COMPARISON UNTOUCHED COUNTRY WHERE HOUSES HAD SOME ROOFS ON THEM
AND TREES SOME BRANCHES ALL LAID OUT AHEAD IN THE HOT SUNSHINE
BETWEEN FLERS AND LESBUFS THERE WERE FIGURES IN THE LANDSCAPE
TOOGERMANS ON THE MOVE WITH BATTERIES AND TRANSPORTAN ENEMY IN
SIGHT AT LAST AND BY THE LOOK OF THEM MOVING AWAY THEN A GERMAN
FIELDBATTERY ALSO IN THE OPEN PULLED UP AND METHODICALLY SHELLED
THEM THEY CAME UPON A SHALLOW TRENCH LITTERED WITH WRECKAGE
SCRAPED THEMSELVES IN AND THERE FOUND SOME MORE OF THE DIVISION
WHILE THE GERMAN BATTERY CONTINUED TO FIND THEM IN THE LONG RUN
THAT TRENCH WHICH HAD BEEN A GERMAN COVEREDWAY FOR GUNS CAME
TO HOLD ABOUT SIXTY OF THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS THIRTY OF THE 2ND
GRENADIERS UNDER CAPTAIN A F S CUNNINGHAM AND A HUNDRED OR SO OF
BOTH BATTALIONS COLDSTREAM UNDER COLONEL J V CAMPBELL THE SENIOR
OFFICER PRESENT SOMEWHERE ON THE LEFT FRONT OF IT FIFTEEN OF THE
IRISH WERE FOUND LYING OUT IN SHELLHOLES UNDER C S M CARTON AND
SERGEANT RIORDAN THEY WERE IN TOUCH SO FAR AS TOUCH EXISTED THEN
WITH THE 9TH RIFLE BRIGADE ON THEIR LEFT BUT IT WAS NOT ADVISABLE TO
SHOW ONES HEAD ABOVE A SHELLHOLE ON ACCOUNT OF ENEMY MACHINEGUNS
WHICH WERE VIVIDLY IN TOUCH WITH EVERYTHING THAT MOVED THEIR RIGHT
WAS ALL IN THE AIR AND FOR THE SECOND TIME NO ONE KNEWNO ONE COULD
KNOWWHERE THE TRENCH IN WHICH THEY LAY WAS SITUATED IN THE EXISTING
CHAOS THEY FIXED ITS POSITION AT LAST BY COMPASSBEARINGS IT WAS
MORE OR LESS ON THE LINE OF THE SECOND OBJECTIVE AND HAD THEREFORE
TO BE HELD IN SPITE OF CASUALTIES THE MEN COULD DO NO MORE THAN
FIRE WHEN POSSIBLE AT ANYTHING THAT SHOWED ITSELF WHICH WAS SELDOM
AND IN THE RARE INTERVALS WHEN SHELLING SLACKENED WORK THEMSELVES
A LITTLE FURTHER INTO THE GROUND AT THIS JUNCTURE CAPTAIN L R
HARGREAVES LEFT BEHIND WITH THE RESERVE OF OFFICERS IN TRNES WOOD
WAS ORDERED UP AND REACHED THE LINE WITH NOTHING WORSE THAN ONE
WOUND HE LED OUT A MIXED PARTY OF COLDSTREAM AND IRISH TO A CHAIN
OF DISCONNECTED SHELLHOLES A FEW HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE
TRENCH HERE THEY SUFFERED FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON UNDER THE
FIELDBATTERY SHELLING THEM AT LESS THAN HALF A MILE AND THE REGULAR
SCYTHING OF THE MACHINEGUNS FROM THE QUADRILATERAL ON THEIR RIGHT
A MACHINEGUN DETACHMENT UNDER LIEUTENANT L C WHITEFOORD WENT
WITH THEM AND LIEUTENANT W C MUMFORD AND 2ND LIEUTENANT F S L
SMITH WITH THEIR LITTLE DETACHMENTS OF IRISH AND COLDSTREAM CAME UP
LATER AS REINFORCEMENTS THAT SCATTERED FORWARD FRINGE AMONG THE
SHELLHOLES GAVE WHAT HELP IT COULD TO THE TRENCH BEHIND IT WHICH
FILLED UP AS THE DAY WORE ON WITH MORE IRISH AND COLDSTREAM WORKING
THEIR WAY FORWARD FORMATION WAS GONEBLOWN TO BITS LONG AGO NEARLY
EVERY OFFICER WAS DOWN AND SERGEANT AFTER SERGEANT SUCCEEDING TO
THE COMMAND HAD DROPPED TOO BUT THE DISCIPLINE HELD AND WITH IT
THE INSTINCT THAT MADE THEM CRAWL DODGE RUN AND STUMBLE AS CHANCE
OFFERED AND THEIR CORPORALS ORDERED TOWARDS THE ENEMY AND NOT AWAY
FROM HIM THEY HAD DONE SO AT FIRST SHOUTING ALOUD IN THE MASSED
RUSH OF THE FULL CHARGE THAT NOW SEEMED CENTURIES AWAY IN TIME AND
WORLDS IN SPACE LATER AS THEY WERE SCATTERED AND BROKEN BY FIRE
KNOWING THAT THEIR BATTALION WAS CUT TO PIECES THEY WORKED WITH A
CERTAIN AUTOMATIC FORLORN EARNESTNESS WHICH HAD ANY ONE HAD TIME TO
THINK WAS EXTREMELY COMIC FOR INSTANCE WHEN A SERGEANT CAME ACROSS
A STRAY PRIVATE MEDITATING LONGER THAN SEEMED NECESSARY AT THE BOTTOM
OF A TOOTEMPTING SHELLHOLE HE ASKED HIM GRAVELY WHAT HE THOUGHT HE
WAS DOING THE MAN DAZED AND SHAKEN REPLIED WITH AN EQUAL GRAVITY
THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THEN SAID THE SERGEANT GET ON FORWARD OUT
O THIS AN MAYBE YELL FIND OUT AND SMOTE HIM DISPASSIONATELY
WITH THE FLAT OF A SPADE THE MAN WITHOUT A WORD ROSE UP LIFTED
HIS HEAD ONCE MORE INTO THE BULLETTORN AIR AND PITCHED FORWARD
DEAD A FEW PACES FARTHER ON AND AT ONE TIME IN A TERRIBLE WAITING
PAUSE WHEN IT WAS DEATH TO SHOW A FINGER THEY SAW ONE MAN OUT ON
THE FLANK SUDDENLY TAKEN BY MADNESS HE LIFTED HIMSELF UP SLOWLY
AND AS SLOWLY MARCHED ACROSS THE OPEN TOWARDS THE ENEMY FIRING HIS
RIFLE IN THE AIR MEANTIME THE BULLETS SEEMED TO AVOID HIM FOR A LONG
WHILE TILL HE WAS VISIBLY JERKED OFF HIS FEET BY SEVERAL THAT STRUCK
HIM ALTOGETHER THE STIFF BLIND DEATHMARCH ENDED AND THE WATCHING
IRISH CLICKED THEIR TONGUES FOR WONDER AND PITY

THE BATTALION HAD HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS
OR ANY ONE ELSE SINCE EARLY MORNING IT LACKED SUPPORTS LIGHTS
SIGNALS INFORMATION WOOD WIRE SANDBAGS WATER FOOD AND AT
LEAST FIFTY PER CENT OF ITS STRENGTH ITS LAST MACHINEGUN HAD
BEEN KNOCKED OUT AND IT HAD NO IDEA WHAT TROOPS MIGHT BE NEXT ON
EITHER SIDE AS THE SUN WENT DOWN WORD CAME FROM THE ADVANCED
PARTY IN THE SHELLHOLES WHERE THE WRECKED MACHINEGUN LAY THAT
THE GERMANS WERE MASSING FOR A COUNTERATTACK ON THE BLUE LINE OF
WHAT HAD BEEN THE THIRD OBJECTIVE THEY COULD BE SEEN IN ARTILLERY
FORMATION WITH A MASS OF TRANSPORT BEHIND THEM AND IT PASSED THE
MENS COMPREHENSION WHY THEY DID NOT COME ON AND FINISH THE WEARY
GAME BUT THE ENEMY CHOSE TO WAIT AND AT THE EDGE OF DUSK THE IRISH
SAW THE 2ND SCOTS GUARDS ATTACKING ON THEIR RIGHT THROUGH A BARRAGE
OF HEAVY STUFFATTACKING AND DISAPPEARING BETWEEN THE SHELLBURSTS
THE ATTACK FAILED A FEW OF THE SCOTS GUARDS CAME BACK AND FOUND
PLACES BESIDE THE IRISH AND COLDSTREAM IN THE TRENCH NIGHT FELL
THE ENEMYS COUNTERATTACK HELD OFF THE SURVIVORS OF THE ADVANCED
PARTY IN THE SHELLHOLES WERE WITHDRAWN TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE MAIN
TRENCH AND WHEN IT WAS DARK MEN WERE SENT OUT TO GET INTO TOUCH
WITH THE FLANKS THEY REPORTED AT LAST A BATTALION OF THE DUKE OF
CORNWALLS ON THEIR LEFT AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS ON THEIR RIGHT IN
THE PROTECTING DARKNESS TOO WATER AND RATIONS ARRIVED FROM THE
GINCHYLESBUFS ROAD BY SOME UNCONSIDERED MIRACLEWORK OF CAPTAIN
ANTROBUS AND THE OTHER BATTALION TRANSPORT OFFICERS AND THROUGHOUT
THE VERY LONG NIGHT STRAGGLERS AND LITTLE CUTOFF PARTIES WITH
THEIR WOUNDED FOUND THE TRENCH REPORTED FED AND FLUNG THEMSELVES
DOWN IN WHATEVER PLACE WAS LEAST WALKED OVERTO SLEEP LIKE THE DEAD
THEIR NEIGHBOURS GROUNDFLARES HAD AT LAST INDICATED THE BATTALIONS
POSITION TO OUR NIGHTSCOUTING CONTACT AEROPLANES THERE WAS NOTHING
MORE TO BE DONE EXCEPTAS ONE SURVIVOR PUT ITWE WAS BUSY THRYIN
TO KEEP ALIVE AGAINST THE NEXT DAY

THE DAWN OF SEPTEMBER 16 PINNED THEM STRICTLY TO THEIR CRAMPED
POSITION FOR THE SLOPE BEHIND THEM RAN IN FULL VIEW OF THE ENEMY
MOREOVER ENEMY AEROPLANES HAD RISEN EARLY AND TAKEN GOOD STOCK
OF THE CROWDED SHALLOW TRENCH WHERE THEY LAY AND IN DUE TIME THE
ENEMY ARTILLERY BEGAN TO SCOURGE THEM BUT SOME OF OUR BATTERIES HAD
MOVED UP IN THE NIGHT AND ONE LITTLE FIELDBATTERY THAT THE IRISH
THOUGHT VERY KINDLY OF ALL THAT DAY DISTRACTED THEIR TORMENTORS SO
THAT THOUGH THEY WERE SHELLED WITH HE AND SHRAPNEL AS A MATTER
OF PRINCIPLE FROM DAWN TO DARK THEY COULD STILL MAKE SHIFT TO HANG
ON THE ONLY ORDERS THEY RECEIVED FROM THE BRIGADE THAT DAY WERE
TO MAINTAIN THEIR POSITIONS AND STAND BY TO SUPPORT AN ATTACK BY
THE 3RD BRIGADE THAT ATTACK HOWEVER NEVER WAS LAUNCHED THEY
LAY STILL AND WATCHED BETWEEN BURSTS OF SHELLING A BATTALION ON
THEIR LEFT ATTACKING SOME GERMAN TRENCHES SOUTH OF GUEUDECOURT
THIS HAPPENED ONCE IN THE MORNING AND ONCE IN THE AFTERNOON SMALL
STOOPING OR CRAWLING FIGURES CREPT OUT FOR A WHILE OVER THE FACE
OF THE LANDSCAPE DREW THE GERMAN GUNS INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE
SHELLING THE IRISH TRENCH UPON THEIR ADVANCE WAVERED FORWARD
INTO THE SMOKE OF IT SPREAD OUT AND DISAPPEAREDPRECISELY AS THE
WATCHING GUARDS THEMSELVES HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE THE IMPRESSION
OF UNREALITY WAS AS STRONG AS IN A CINEMASHOW NOTHING SEEMED TO
HAPPEN THAT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE SMALL SHAPES GESTICULATED A LITTLE
LAY DOWN AND GOT UP AGAIN OR HAVING LAIN DOWN ROSE NO MORE THEN
THE GERMAN GUNS RETURNED TO BOMBARDING THE BROWNLINE TRENCH AND
THE MEN LYING CLOSER REALISED THAT THE LIMELIGHT OF THE SHOW HAD
SHIFTED AND WAS TURNED MERCILESSLY UPON THEMSELVES AGAIN ALL THEY
WANTED WAS RELIEFRELIEF FROM THE NOISES AND THE STENCHES OF THE
HIGH EXPLOSIVES THE CLINGING HORROR OF THE SIGHTS NEAREST THEM
AND FROM THE TENSION THAT LAY AT THE BACK OF THE MINDS OF THE MOST
UNIMAGINATIVE THE MEN WERE DUMBTIRED WITH MERE WORK AND SUFFERING
THE FEW OFFICERS DOUBLY TIRED OUT BY THAT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF KEEPING AWAKE AND THINKING CONSECUTIVELY EVEN WHEN THEIR WORDS
OF COMMAND CLOTTED ON THEIR TONGUES THROUGH SHEAR WEARINESS THE
ODDS WERE HEAVILY IN FAVOUR OF A GERMAN ATTACK AFTER DARK AND A
WRITTEN WARNING FROM THE REAR SAID IT WOULD CERTAINLY COME IN THE
COURSE OF THE NIGHT A PARTY OF EXPLORERS SENT TO LOOK FOR DEFENCES
FOUND SOME SECTIONS OF BARBWIRE ON TRESTLES IN THE WRECK OF AN
ENEMYTRENCH BEHIND THEM IT WAS MANHANDLED AND BROUGHT AWAY BY
LENGTHS AND IN SOME FASHION SET UP BEFORE THE TRENCH SO THAT THE
ENEMY MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY STROLL OVER THEM WITHOUT WARNING

FRESH RUMOURS OF GERMAN COUNTERATTACKS ARRIVED AFTER MIDNIGHT IN
THE WAY THAT INFORMATION BLOWS BACK AND FORTH ACROSS A BATTLEFIELD
IN REACTION THE MEN WERE ONCE MORE ROUSEDIN A BURST OF CHILL
RAINTO STRENGTHEN THE OUTPOST LINE THEY MUST HAVE MADE SOME
NOISE ABOUT IT BEING MORE THAN HALF ASLEEP AT THE TIME BUT THE
ENEMY SO FAR FROM ATTACKING OPENED WITH LONGRANGE SMALLARM FIRE
AND SENT UP A MYRIAD LIGHTS THAT RIOT DIED DOWN AT LAST AND WHEN
THE BATTALIONS THIRD DAWN IN THE LINE HAD WELL BROKEN A COMPANY
OF LINCOLNS FROM THE 62ND BRIGADE CAME UP TO THE TRENCH AND SAID
THEIR ORDERS WERE TO RELIEVE THE LIGHT WAS FULL ENOUGH NOW TO
REVEAL THEM VERY CLEARLY AND A RAPID RELIEF WAS EFFECTED WITH SOME
DIFFICULTY THE ENEMY SHELLED TILL THEY REACHED THE SHELTER OF THE
RIDGE BEHIND AND THERE AT LAST DREW CLEAR OF THE IMMEDIATE ASPECT
OF WAR OTHER SCATTERED PARTIES OF THE BATTALION WITH LITTLE KNOTS
OF LIGHTLY WOUNDED MEN JOINED THEM ON THEIR WAY TO THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF BERNAFAY WOOD WHERE THEY TOOK RECKONING OF THEIR LOSSES
THEY HAD STILL SEVEN OFFICERS LEFT INCLUDING 2ND LIEUTENANT T F
MACMAHON WHO WITH SOME FORTY MEN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN DIVISIONAL
RESERVE ON THE 16TH AND THE WHOLE OF THE WORKING PLATOON WHICH HAD
NOT BEEN IN ACTION REJOINED THE BATTALION PRACTICALLY INTACT THE
WORKING PLATOON WHICH WAS MADE UP OF TWO MEN FROM EACH PLATOON WAS
POPULARLY CREDITED WITH FABRICATING HEADQUARTERS DUGOUTS AT ENORMOUS
DISTANCES FROM THE FIRINGLINE AND WAS TREATED RATHER AS A JEST BY
MEN NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE DRAWN FOR IT AS FOR THE REST MAJOR T M
BAILIE LIEUTENANT C R TISDALL LIEUTENANT L C WHITEFOORD AND
2ND LIEUTENANT N BUTLER WERE KILLED CAPTAIN C PEASE AND LIEUTENANT
J K GREER DIED OF WOUNDS CAPTAIN P S LONGINNES CAPTAIN R
RANKIN LIEUTENANT A C W INNES 2ND LIEUTENANTS H C HOLMES T
BUTLERSTONEY AND COUNT J E DE SALIS WERE WOUNDED AND THERE WERE
OVER 330 CASUALTIES IN THE OTHER RANKS THE TOTAL CASUALTIES IN THE
BRIGADE WERE 1776

NO ONE SEEMS TO RECALL ACCURATELY THE ORDER OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE
GATHERING IN BERNAFAY WOOD AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE SHADOW OF THE
BATTALION IN CAMP AT THE CITADEL THE SUN WAS SHINING BREAKFAST WAS
READY FOR THE OFFICERS AND MEN NEAR SOME TREES IT STRUCK THEIR VERY
TIRED APPREHENSIONS THAT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EQUIPAGE AND
SERVICE FOR A VERY FEW MEN AND THEY NOTICED DULLY A SUDDEN HUSTLING
OFF OF UNNEEDED PLATES AND CUPS THEY FELT AS THOUGH THEY HAD
RETURNED TO A WORLD WHICH HAD OUTGROWN THEM ON A SOMEWHAT TERRIFYING
SCALE DURING ALL THE AGES THAT THEY HAD BEEN AWAY FROM IT THEIR ONE
NEED AFTER FOOD EATEN SITTING WAS REST AND WHEN THE FIRST STUPOR
OF EXHAUSTION WAS SATISFIED THEIR SLEEP BEGAN TO BE BROKEN BY DREAMS
ONLY LESS HORRIBLE THAN THE MEMORIES TO WHICH THEY WAKED


SEPTEMBER 25

BUT THE CURE WAS READY TO HAND ON THE EVENING OF THE 18TH SEPTEMBER
IN WET AND COLD WEATHER THE BRIGADIER SENT THE BATTALION A LETTER OF
PRAISE AND PROPHECY

AS YOUR BRIGADIER I WISH TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS AS TO YOUR MOST
GALLANT WORK ON THE 15TH SEPTEMBER 1916 IN THE OPERATIONS AT
GINCHY THE ADVANCE FROM THE ORCHARD IN THE FACE OF MACHINEGUN
FIRE IS EQUAL TO ANYTHING YOU HAVE YET ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS
CAMPAIGN AND ONCE MORE THE 1ST BATTALION IRISH GUARDS HAS CARRIED
OUT A MOST MAGNIFICENT ADVANCE AND HELD GROUND GAINED IN SPITE
OF THE MOST SEVERE LOSSES IN THIS YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN YOU ARE
UPHOLDING THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF BRAVERY AND EFFICIENCY FOR YOUR
SUCCESSORS AND MORE PRAISE THAN THAT I CANNOT GIVE YOU YOU MAY BE
CALLED UPON IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE TO CARRY OUT SIMILAR WORK AND
I KNOW YOU WILL NOT FAIL

SD C E PEREIRA
BRIGADIERGENERAL
COMMANDING 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE

THIS MEANT THAT THEY WOULD BE MOVED AGAIN AS SOON AS THEY COULD STAND
UP AND WOULD GO INTO THEIR NEXT ACTION WITH AT LEAST 50 PER CENT
NEW DRAFTS AND HALF THEIR PROPER ALLOWANCE OF OFFICERS INDEED THEY
WERE WARNED NEXT DAY WITH THE REST OF THEIR DIVISION FOR FURTHER
OPERATIONS IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND THE WORK OF REMAKING AND
REEQUIPPING THE BATTALION FROM END TO END SAVED THEM FROM THAT
GHASTLY STATE OF BODY AND SOUL WHICH IS KNOWN AS FIGHTING HUNS IN
YOUR SLEEP

ON THE 19TH MAJOR T M D BAILIES BODY WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM THE
FRONT AND BURIED IN THE CEMETERY IN THE CENTRE OF THE CAMP AT CARNOY
AND ON THE SAME DAY LORD CAVAN COMMANDING THE CORPS RODE OVER AND
SPOKE TO THE OFFICERS ON HORSEBACK OF THE PROGRESS OF THE CAMPAIGN
OF WHAT HAD SO FAR BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ON THE SOMME WHAT WAS INTENDED
FOR THE FUTURE AND SPECIALLY AS BEARING ON THEIR NEXT BATTLE OF
WHAT THEIR ARTILLERY HAD IN STORE FOR THE ENEMY IT WAS A SIMPLE
UNADORNED SPEECH THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH HE REPEATED TO THE NCOS
THEN WISHED THE GENTLEMEN OF HIS MAJESTYS FOOT GUARDS ALL GOOD
FORTUNE AND RODE AWAY

THE DIVISION HAD EXPECTED TO BE USED AGAIN AS SOON AS MIGHT BE BUT
THEIR RECENT LOSSES WERE SO HEAVY THAT EVERY BATTALION IN IT WAS
SPECULATING BENEATH ITS BREATH HOW THEIR NEW DRAFTS WOULD SHAPE IT
IS ONE THING TO TAKE IN MEN BY FIFTIES AT A TIME AND WELD THEM SLOWLY
IN THE SALIENT TO A COMMON ENDURANCE IT IS QUITE ANOTHER TO LAUNCH A
BATTALION MORE THAN HALF UNTRIED RECRUITS ACROSS THE OPEN AGAINST
ALL THAT ORGANIZED DEATH CAN DELIVER THIS WAS A TIME THAT AGAIN
TESTED THE DEPOT AND RESERVE BATTALION WHOSE NEVERENDING WORK ALL
FIGHTING BATTALIONS TAKE FOR GRANTED OR MENTION ONLY TO BLAME BUT
WARLEY AND CATERHAM HAD NOT FAILED THEM OVER THREE HUNDRED RECRUITS
WERE SENT UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 15TH AND 16TH AND ON THE 20TH
SEPTEMBER THE REMADE BATTALION LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED STRONG WITH
TEN OFFICERS MARCHED OUT OF CITADEL CAMP TO ITS DETESTABLE TRENCHES
ON GINCHY RIDGE THE TWO COLDSTREAM BATTALIONS OF THE 1ST BRIGADE
HELD THE FRONT LINE THERE THE 2ND GRENADIERS IN RESERVE AND THE
1ST IRISH GUARDS IN SUPPORT

THE GROUND WAS NOT YET A SEA OF MUD BUT QUITE SUFFICIENTLY
TENACIOUS THE AREA ALLOTTED WAS OLD TRENCHES AND NEWISH
SHELLHOLES WITH WATER AT THE BOTTOM IN THE SMALL RECTANGULAR WOOD
EAST OF TRNES WOOD THEY WERE EMPLOYED FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS IN
CLEANING UP THE LITTER OF BATTLE ALL ABOUT THE SLOPES AND PILING IT
IN DUMPS WHILE THE ENEMY SHELLED THEM MORE OR LESS REGULARLY WITH
LARGE BLACK 59 SHELLSA VERY FAIR TEST OF THE NEW DRAFTS NERVES
THE STUFF WOULD DROP UNHERALDED THROUGH THE THEN LEAFY WOODS AND
EXPLODE AT LARGE AMONG THE SHELTERS AND SLITS THAT THE MEN HAD MADE
FOR THEMSELVES THEY TOOK THE NOISE AND THE SHAKING WITH PHILOSOPHY
AS THEIR NCOS TESTIFIED THERE WAS SOME WONDHERIN IN THE NEW
DRAFTS BUT NO BUDGIN YELL UNDERSTAND

READING BETWEEN LINES ONE CAN SEE THAT THE RC PRIEST THE REVEREND
FATHER F M BROWNE WAS BUSY IN THOSE DAYS ON SPIRITUAL AFFAIRS FOR
HE WAS HIT IN THE FACE ON THE 23RD WHILE VISITING A NEIGHBOURING
BATTERY SO THAT MASS ON THE 24THTHE DAY BEFORE THEIR SECOND
BATTLE OF THE SOMMEWAS CELEBRATED BY THE REVEREND FATHER CASEY
THEY WERE SHELLED TOO THAT SUNDAY IN THE WOOD A SINGLE UNLUCKY
SHELL KILLING TWO MEN AND WOUNDING THIRTEEN THE LAST AVAILABLE
OFFICER FROM THE BASE LIEUTENANT A H BLOM HAD JOINED THE NIGHT
BEFORE ALL DRAFTS WERE IN THE GROUND WAS ASSUMED TO BE WALKABLE
WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE AND ABOUT 9 P M OF A PITCHBLACK SUNDAY
NIGHT THE BATTALION LEFT THE WOOD AND REACHED ITS ASSEMBLYTRENCH
AN EXTRAORDINARY BAD AND UNPROTECTED ONE ABOUT MIDNIGHT THEY WERE
PROMISCUOUSLY SHELLED IN THE DARKNESS AND THE TRENCH WHEN FOUND
WAS SO NARROW THAT THEY HAD TO STAND ON THE EDGE OF IT TILL THE
BATTALION THAT THEY RELIEVEDIT DID NOT KEEP THEM WAITING LONGGOT
OUT NO 1 COMPANY CAPTAIN L R HARGREAVES NO 2 COMPANY CAPTAIN
THE HON P J OGILVY WERE IN THE FRONT LINE THE LATTER ON THE
RIGHT NO 3 COMPANY LIEUTENANT A H BLOM AND NO 4 COMPANY
CAPTAIN RODAKOWSKI ABOUT 150 YARDS BEHIND WITH THE BATTALION
HEADQUARTERS IN A DIAGONAL COMMUNICATIONTRENCH WELL BOTTOMED WITH
WATER SECOND LIEUTENANT T C GIBSON WAS WOUNDED ON THE WAY UP AND
WAS REPLACED BY 2ND LIEUTENANT T F MACMAHON WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN
REGIMENTAL RESERVE

THE IDEA OF THE DAYS WORK FOR THE 25TH WAS LESS AMBITIOUS THAN
ON THE 15TH AND THE OBJECTIVES WERE VISIBLE GERMAN TRENCHES NOT
IMAGINARY LINES ON UNIFORMLY INDISTINGUISHABLE LANDSCAPES HERE IS
THE BRIGADEMAJORS MEMORANDUM FOR THE 1ST BRIGADE ON THE LIE OF THE
LAND ISSUED ON THE 22ND SEPTEMBER THEY WERE TO ATTACK AND CARRY
THE VILLAGE OF LESBUFS UP THE GINCHYLESBUFS ROAD ABOUT FIFTEEN
HUNDRED YARDS ON A FRONT AGAIN OF FIVE HUNDRED YARDS THE IRISH
GUARDS LEADING THE ATTACK THROUGHOUT ON THE LEFT OF THE 1ST BRIGADE
AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS ON THE RIGHT IT WAS IN ESSENCE THE CLEARING
OUT OF A BADLY SHAKEN ENEMY LINE BY THE HELP OF EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY
BARRAGES

1ST GUARDS BRIGADE NO 262

THE FORTHCOMING ATTACK DIFFERS FROM THE LAST IN THAT THE WHOLE
SCHEME IS NOT SUCH AN AMBITIOUS ONE THE DISTANCE TO THE FIRST
OBJECTIVE IS ABOUT 300 YARDS TO THE SECOND OBJECTIVE 800 YARDS
AND TO THE LAST OBJECTIVE ABOUT 1300 YARDS IN EACH CASE THE
OBJECTIVE IS A CLEARLY DEFINED ONE AND NOT MERELY A LINE DRAWN
ACROSS THE MAP

BETWEEN OUR PRESENT FRONT LINE AND THE FIRST OBJECTIVE THERE IS
ONLY NO MANS LAND DURING THE NEXT TWO NIGHTS THIS SHOULD BE
ACTIVELY PATROLLED TO ENSURE THAT OUR ATTACK IS NOT TAKEN BY
SURPRISE BY SOME UNKNOWN TRENCH AND IN ORDER THAT OFFICERS AND
NCOS MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GROUND

IT WOULD ALSO BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE TO THE ARTILLERY IF REPORTS AS
TO THE ACTUAL DISTANCE TO THE GREEN LINE WERE SENT IN

THE GROUND SLOPES DOWN TO LESBUFS BEYOND WHICH THERE IS A
DISTINCT HOLLOW WITH A PLATEAU THE SAME LEVEL AS LESBUFS BEYOND
ON REACHING THE FINAL OBJECTIVE OFFICERS AND NCOS SHOULD
UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY FOR PUSHING PATROLS OUT TO COMMAND THIS
HOLLOW AND GIVE WARNING OR PREVENT COUNTERATTACKS FORMING UP HERE

LARGE SCALE MAPS OF LESBUFS HAVE BEEN SENT TO ALL BATTALIONS
THESE SHOULD BE CAREFULLY STUDIED BY ALL OFFICERS AND NCOS
AND ESPECIALLY BY THOSE OF THE COMPANIES DETAILED FOR THE CLEANING
UP OF LESBUFS

ALL RUNNERS AND SIGNALLERS SHOULD KNOW THE POSITION OF THE ADVANCED
BRIGADE REPORT CENTRE AND THAT THE BEST MEANS OF APPROACH TO IT
WILL PROBABLY BE DOWN THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCH T3C AND T8B

FINALLY IT CANNOT BE TOO MUCH IMPRESSED ON ASSAULTING TROOPS THE
NECESSITY FOR CLINGING TO OUR OWN BARRAGE IT WILL BE AN ATTACK IN
WHICH THIS SHOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY AND ON WHICH THE SUCCESS
OF THE WHOLE OPERATION MAY DEPEND

SEPTEMBER 22 1916

THE BATTALIONS OWN TASK WAS TO CLEAR THE THREE OBJECTIVES LAID DOWN
SUPPORTED BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAM TO CLEAN OUT THE NORTHERN PORTION
OF LESBUFS VILLAGE AND ABOVE ALL TO SECURE THEIR FLANKS WHEN THEY
HALTED OR WERE HELD UP THEY WAITED IN THEIR TRENCHES WHILE OUR GUNS
HOUR AFTER HOUR SLUICED THE ROADS THEY WERE TO TAKE WITH AN EVEN
DOWNPOUR OF SHELL ALONG THE TRENCHES TO BE ATTACKEDOVER LESBUFS
AND ITS HIDDEN DEFENCES AND FAR OUT INTO THE UNTOUCHED FARMING LAND
BEYOND IT WAS A FINE SUNNY MORNING THAT HID NOTHING AT 1235 OUR
BARRAGE LOCKED DOWN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OF THE TROOPS AND NOS 1
AND 2 COMPANIES MOVED OUT WITH THE REST OF THE LINE TOWARDS THE FIRST
GERMAN TRENCH THREE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY THE ENEMY PUT DOWN A BARRAGE
AT ONCE ON OUR FRONTSUPPORT AND COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES WHICH CAUSED
A GOOD MANY CASUALTIES INCLUDING CAPTAIN R J P RODAKOWSKI AND
THE DOCTOR IN NOS 3 AND 4 COMPANIES WHO WERE MOVING UP AS A SECOND
WAVE EVENTUALLY THESE COMPANIES FOUND IT LESS HAMPERING TO LEAVE
THE CROWDED TRENCH AND COME OUT OVER THE OPEN SO FAR OUR ARTILLERY
WORK WAS ALTOGETHER A BETTER BUSINESS THAN ON THE 15TH THE COMPANIES
MOVED ALMOST LEISURELY BEHIND THE ROARING ARCHOFTRIUMPH OF THE
BARRAGE TILL THE LEADING LINE REACHED THE FIRST TRENCH WITH ITS
HALFFINISHED DUGOUTS HERE THEY FOUND ONLY DAZED GERMAN SURVIVORS
BEGGING TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THAT INFERNO TO THE NEAREST PRISONERS
KRAAL SOME OF THESE CAPTURES OFFICERS INCLUDED SINCERELY EXPECTED
TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN COLD BLOOD

THE 2ND GRENADIERS ON THE RIGHT OF THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS HAD BEEN
UNLUCKY IN THEIR POSITION FOR THE WIRE IN FRONT OF THEIR SECTOR
BEING VEILED BY HIGH CROP OUR GUNS HAD MISSED IT THAT BATTALION
SUFFERED HEAVILY IN OFFICERS AND MEN SHOT DOWN AS THEY TRIED TO WORK
THEIR WAY THROUGH BY HAND BUT THEY NEVER LOST TOUCH AND THE ADVANCE
WENT ON UNBROKENLY TO THE NEXT POINTA SUNKEN ROAD ON THE EAST SIDE
OF LESBUFS FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OF THE FIRST OBJECTIVE ALL
FOUR COMPANIES OF THE IRISH WERE TOGETHER NOWLIEUTENANT BLOM OF
NO 3 HAD BEEN WOUNDED AT THE FIRST TRENCH AND 2ND LIEUTENANT T
F MACMAHON TOOK OVER THEY REACHED THE DOWNWARD SLOPE TO THE SUNK
ROAD AND AS AT THE FIRST OBJECTIVE FOUND MOST OF THEIR WORK HAD
BEEN DONE FOR THEM BY THE BARRAGE EVEN WHILE THEY CONGRATULATED
THEMSELVES AND SENT OFF A PIGEON AS WELL AS RUNNER MESSAGES TO
REPORT THE CAPTURE TO BATTALION HEADQUARTERS WHICH SOMEWHAT
BROKEN BY THE GERMAN SHELLING HAD ARRIVED IN THE FIRSTTAKEN
TRENCH FIRE FELL ON THEM FROM THE SOUTH OUR OWN GUNS MISRANGING
ACROSS THE FIELDS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND A
SECOND PIGEON WAS DESPATCHED PRAYING THEM TO CEASE BUT THERE WERE A
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES BEFORE THE ADVANCE TO THE LAST OBJECTIVE BEGAN
THIS WAS SHOWN ON THE MAP AS JUST EAST OF LESBUFS VILLAGE AND EAST
AGAIN OF ANOTHER SUNKEN ROAD THE FINAL SURGE FORWARD INCLUDED A
RUSH ACROSS UPROOTED ORCHARDS AND THROUGH WRECKED HOUSES SHOPS AND
BARNS WITH BUILDINGS ALIGHT OR CONFUSEDLY COLLAPSING ROUND THEM AND
THE ENEMY STREAMING OUT AHEAD TO HIDE IN SHELLHOLES IN THE OPEN
THERE WAS NOT MUCH KILLING AT THIS POINT AND THANKS TO THE TANKS
AND THE GUNS A GOOD DEAL LESS MACHINEGUN FIRE THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED THE BATTALION DUG IN IN A POTATO FIELD A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
BEYOND THE VILLAGE WHERE THE MEN PROVIDENTLY LAID ASIDE THE LARGEST
POTATOES FOR SUPPER IF SO BE THEY SHOULD LIVE TILL THAT MEAL IN
THE MEANTIME OUR GUNS WERE PUNCHING HOLES INTO THE OPEN LAND BEHIND
LESBUFS WHERE PARTIES OF DISLODGED ENEMY HAD TAKEN SHELTER THESE
PREFERRED AT LAST TO BOLT BACK THROUGH THAT STORM AND SURRENDER TO
OUR MEN DIGGING WHO RECEIVED THEM WITH DERISIVE CHEERSFOR ALL THE
WORLD AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN HARES IN A BEAT

THEN CAME THE TRAGEDY OUR BARRAGE FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER WAVERED
AND STOPPED ALMOST ON THE LINE WHERE THE MEN WERE DIGGING IN AND
THERE HUNG FOR A LONG WHILESOME ACCOUNTS SAY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
OTHERS TWO HOURS AT ANY RATE IT WAS LONG ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR MANY
MORE CASUALTIES CAPTAIN L R HARGREAVES WHO HAD FOUGHT WOUNDED
THROUGH THE 15TH WAS HERE SO SEVERELY WOUNDED THAT HE DIED WHILE
BEING CARRIED BACK AND CAPTAIN DRURYLOWE OF THE KINGS COMPANY OF
THE 1ST GRENADIERS DIGGING IN ON THE IRISH LEFT WAS KILLEDBOTH
CASUALTIES BY ONE SHELL THE 2ND GRENADIERS ALL COMPANY OFFICERS
DOWN WERE IN TOUCH ON THE RIGHT BUT THE LEFT WAS STILL DOUBTFUL
FOR THE ATTACK THERE HAD BEEN HELD UP AT GUEUDECOURT VILLAGE AND
THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE HAD TO MAKE A DEFENSIVE FLANK THERE WHILE A
COMPANY OF THE 3RD COLDSTREAM WAS MOVED UP TO HELP IN THE WORK

IN MODERN WAR NO VICTORY APPEARS TILL THE END OF ALL AND WHAT
IS GAINED BY IMMENSE BLOODSHED MUST BE HELD BY IMMENSE PHYSICAL
LABOUR OF CONSOLIDATION WHICH GIVES THE ENEMY TIME TO RECOVER
AND COUNTERATTACK IN HIS TURN THE IRISH DUG AND DEEPENED AND
STRENGTHENED THEIR LINE NORTH OF LESBUFS WHILE THE ENEMY SHELLED
THEM TILL AFTERNOON WHEN THERE WAS A BREATHING SPACE A GERMAN
COUNTERATTACK ON THE LEFT OF THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS LAUNCHED
AND FORTHWITH BURNED UP THE SHELLING WAS RESUMED TILL NIGHT WHICH
SUDDENLY FELL SO QUIET BY SOMME STANDARDS THAT SUPPLIES COULD
BE BROUGHT UP WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY AS SOON AS LIGHT FOR
RANGING CAME ON THE 26TH OUR MEN WERE SHELLED TO GROUND AGAIN AND
AN ATTEMPT OF THREE PATROLS TO GET FORWARD AND ESTABLISH POSTS OF
COMMAND ON A NEARBY RIDGE BROUGHT THEM INTO A NEST OF MACHINEGUNS
AND SNIPERS THE DIARY REMARKS THAT THE PATROLS LOCATED AT LEAST ONE
MACHINEGUN WHICH IS PROBABLY A LARGE UNDERSTATEMENT FOR SO SOON
AS THE GERMAN MACHINEGUNNERS RECOVERED BREATH AND EYESIGHT AFTER OR
BETWEEN SHELLS THEY WERE UP AND BACK AND AT WORK AGAIN BY THE RUDE
ARITHMETIC OF THE RANKS IN THOSE DAYS THREE MACHINEGUNS EQUALLED A
COMPANY AND WHEN WELL POSTED A BATTALION

THE BATTALION WAS RELIEVED ON THE EVENING OF THE 26TH BY ITS SISTER
THE 2ND BATTALION WHO TOOK OVER THE WHOLE OF LESBUFS RUINS FROM
THE BRIGADE AND THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS WENT BACK WITH THE OTHERS
THROUGH BERNAFAY WOOD WHERE THEY FED TO CAMP ONCE MORE AT THE
CITADEL

IN THE TWO DAYS OF THEIR SECOND SOMME BATTLE WHICH THEY ENTERED
LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED STRONG AND TEN OFFICERS THEY HAD LOST ONE
OFFICER CAPTAIN HARGREAVES DIED OF WOUNDS AND FIVE WOUNDED AND
MORE THAN 250 CASUALTIES IN OTHER RANKS ADD THESE TO THE CASUALTIES
OF THE 15TH AND IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN TEN DAYS THE BATTALION
HAD PRACTICALLY LOST A BATTALION THE COMMANDING OFFICER COLONEL
MCCALMONT THE ADJUTANT CAPTAIN GORDON AND LIEUTENANT SMITH WERE
THE ONLY OFFICERS WHO HAD COME UNWOUNDED THROUGH BOTH ACTIONS

GENERAL PEREIRA COMMANDING THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE ISSUED THE
FOLLOWING ORDER ON THE 27TH SEPTEMBER

YOU HAVE AGAIN MAINTAINED THE HIGH TRADITIONS OF THE 1ST GUARDS
BRIGADE WHEN CALLED UPON A SECOND TIME IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME
FOR FIVE DAYS PREVIOUS TO THE ASSAULT THE 2ND AND 3RD BATTALION
COLDSTREAM GUARDS HELD THE TRENCHES UNDER CONSTANT HEAVY SHELLFIRE
AND DUG MANY HUNDRED YARDS OF ASSEMBLY AND COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES
THIS WORK BEING CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ENEMYS ARTILLERY
THE 2ND BATTALION GRENADIER GUARDS AND THE 1ST BATTALION IRISH
GUARDS THOUGH UNDER SHELLFIRE IN THEIR BIVOUACS WERE KEPT CLEAR
OF THE TRENCHES UNTIL THE EVENING OF 24TH SEPTEMBER AND WERE GIVEN
THE TASK OF CARRYING BY ASSAULT ALL THE OBJECTIVES TO BE CARRIED BY
THIS BRIGADE NOTHING DETERRED THEM IN THIS ATTACK NOT EVEN THE
FACT THAT IN PLACES THE ENEMY WIRE WAS CUT IN THE FACE OF RIFLE
AND MACHINEGUN FIRE AND IN SPITE OF ALL RESISTANCE AND HEAVY
LOSSES THE ENTIRE MAIN ENEMY DEFENSIVE LINE WAS CAPTURED

EVERY BATTALION IN THE BRIGADE CARRIED OUT ITS TASK TO THE FULL

THE GERMAN RESERVE DIVISION WHICH INCLUDES THE 238TH 239TH AND
240TH REGIMENTS AND WHICH OPPOSED YOU FOR MANY WEEKS AT YPRES
LEFT THE SALIENT ON THE 18TH SEPTEMBER YOU HAVE NOW MET THEM IN
THE OPEN A WORTHY FOE BUT YOU HAVE FILLED THEIR TRENCHES WITH
THEIR DEAD AND HAVE DRIVEN THEM BEFORE YOU IN HEADLONG FLIGHT

I CANNOT SAY HOW PROUD I AM TO HAVE HAD THE HONOUR OF COMMANDING
THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE IN THIS BATTLE A BRIGADE WHICH HAS PROVED
ITSELF TO BE THE FINEST IN THE BRITISH ARMY

THE BRIGADE IS NOW UNDER ORDERS FOR REST AND TRAINING AND IT MUST
NOW BE OUR OBJECT TO KEEP UP THE HIGH STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY AND
THOSE WHO HAVE COME TO FILL OUR DEPLETED RANKS WILL STRIVE THEIR
UTMOST TO FILL WORTHILY THE PLACE OF THOSE GALLANT OFFICERS AND MEN
WHO HAVE LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR A GREAT CAUSE

SD C E PEREIRA
BRIGADIERGENERAL
COMMANDING 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE

SEPTEMBER 28 1916

LORD CAVAN HAD SENT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE TO GENERAL PEREIRA

HEARTY THANKS AND SINCERE CONGRATULATION TO YOU ALL A VERY FINE
ACHIEVEMENT SPLENDIDLY EXECUTED

TO WHICH THE BRIGADIER HAD REPLIED

YOUR OLD BRIGADE VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT YOU WITH
LESBUFS ALL RANKS MOST GRATIFIED BY YOUR KIND CONGRATULATIONS

AND SO THAT LITTLE WAVE AMONG MANY WAVES WHICH HAD DONE ITS WORK
AND GAINED ITS FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF GROUND UP THE BEACH DREW BACK
INTO THE OCEAN OF MEN AND HUTMENTS BELOW THE SLOPES OF THE SOMME
THE NEW DRAFTS WERE NATURALLY RATHER PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES THEIR
NCOS WERE REASONABLY SATISFIED WITH THEM AND THE REMNANT OF THE
OFFICERS WERE FAR TOO BUSY WITH REORGANIZATION AND REEQUIPMENT
TO HAVE DISTINCT NOTIONS ON ANY SUBJECT EXCEPT THE DAYS WORK IT
WAS A LITTLE LATER THAT HEROISMS OR HORRORS SEEN OUT OF THE TAIL
OF THE EYE IN ACTION AND UNREALISED AT THE TIME BECAME ALIVE AS
REST RETURNED TO THE BODY AND MEN COMPARED DREAMS WITH EACH OTHER
OR ARGUED IN WHAT PRECISE MANNER SUCH AND SUCH A COMRADE HAD DIED
THERE WAS BRAVERY ENOUGH AND TO SPARE ON ALL HANDS AND THERE WERE
A FEW BUT NOT TOO MANY DECORATIONS AWARDED FOR IT IN THE COURSE
OF THE NEXT MONTH THE BATTALION TOOK THE BRAVERY FOR GRANTED AND
THE CREDIT OF THE AGGREGATE WENT TO THE BATTALION THEY LOOKED AT
IT BROADLY SPEAKING THUS THERE WAS TIMES WHEN YELL UNDERSTAND
IF A MAN WAS NOT EARNIN VCS FOR HOURS ON END HE WOULD NOT KEEP
ALIVEAN EVEN THEN UNLESS THE SAINTS LOOKED AFTER HIM HED
LIKELY BE KILLED IN THE MIDDEST OF IT IN OTHER WORDS THE AVERAGE
OF BRAVERY REQUIRED IN ACTION HAD RISEN TWENTYFOLD EVEN AS THE
AVERAGE OF SHOTS DELIVERED BY MACHINEGUNS EXCEEDS THAT OF MANY
RIFLES AND BY THE MERCY OF HEAVEN AS THE IRISH THEMSELVES SAW IT
THE SPIRIT OF MAN UNDER DISCIPLINE HAD RISEN TO THOSE HEIGHTS

CAPTAIN L R HARGREAVES KILLED ON THE 25TH AND CAPTAIN P S
LONGINNES WOUNDED WITH LIEUTENANT G V WILLIAMS WHO WAS KNOCKED
UNCONSCIOUS AND NEARLY KILLED BY SHELLFIRE ON THE 25TH WERE GIVEN
THE MILITARY CROSS FOR THE AFFAIR OF THE 15TH DRILLSERGEANT MORAN
A PILLAR OF THE BATTALION WHO HAD DIED OF WOUNDS IT WAS HE WHO
HAD ASKED THE IMMORTAL QUESTION ABOUT THIS RETREAT AT MONS WITH

FOR THE 25TH TEMPORARY CAPTAIN THE HON P OGILVY RECEIVED THE
MILITARY CROSS ACTING COMPANY SERGEANTMAJOR MCMULLEN THE BAR TO
HIS DCM AND PRIVATES WHEARTY TROY AND M LEWIS THE MILITARY
MEDAL CAPTAIN GORDON THE ADJUTANT WAS RECOMMENDED FOR AN IMMEDIATE
MC WHICH HE RECEIVED WITH THE NEXT NEW YEAR HONOURS AT THE SAME
TIME AS THE CO RECEIVED A DSO

IT WAS NOT AN EXTRAVAGANT REWARD FOR MEN WHO HAVE TO KEEP THEIR HEADS
UNDER HIDEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND APPLY COURAGE AND KNOWLEDGE AT THE
GIVEN INSTANT AND AFTER INCONCEIVABLE STRAIN TO HOLD STRENGTHEN
AND TURN DESPERATE SITUATIONS TO THEIR PLATOONS OR COMPANYS
ADVANTAGE THE NEWS WENT INTO WARLEY AND CATERHAM AND SOURED
DRILLSERGEANTS DEADWEARIED WITH THE REPETITIONWORK OF FORMING
RECRUITS TO FILL SHELLHOLES FOUND THEIR LITTLE UNNOTICED REWARD IN
IT YES WE MADE EMWITH THE RHEUMATISM ON US AN ALL AN WE
KEPT ON MAKIN EM TILL I GOT TO HATE THE SILLY FACES OF EM AN
WHAT DID WE GET OUT OF IT TELL WARLEY THAT THEIR LAST DRAFT WAS
DAM RABBITS AN THE ENSIGNS AS BAD AN AFTER THAT ITS MILTRY
CROSSES AND DCMS FOR OUR DAM RABBITS

THE BATTALION RETURNED TO THE DAYS OF SMALL DETAILED IMPORTANT
THINGSTOO WEARIED TO APPRECIATE COMPLIMENTS AND TOO OVERWORKED
WITH BREAKING IN FRESH MATERIAL TO THINK

ON THE 27TH 2ND LIEUTENANT R B S REFORD JOINED FROM THE BASE
ON THE 28TH 2ND LIEUTENANT T F MACMAHON WITH A PARTY WAS SENT TO
RESTCAMP FOR A WEEK ON THE 30TH CAPTAINS THE EARL OF KINGSTON AND

RESTCAMPS AND FATIGUES

ON THE 1ST OCTOBER A SUNDAY AFTER MASS CELEBRATED BY A FRENCH
INTERPRETER WHICH DID NOT AFFECT THE DEVOTION OF THE BATTALION THE
WHOLE BRIGADE WERE EMBARKED IN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FRENCH ARMY
CHARABANCS A NEW AND UNFORESEEN TORMENT AND DRIVEN VIA AMIENS
FROM FRICOURT TO RESTCAMP AT HORNOY MUCH MUST HAVE HAPPENED ON
THAT PLEASURETRIP FOR THE DIARY OBSERVES THAT THE DRIVERS OF THE
VEHICLES WERE APPARENTLY OVER MILITARY AGE MANY OF THE ASSISTANTS
BEING NATIVES ONE IS LEFT IN THE DARK AS TO THEIR COUNTRIES OF
ORIGIN BUT ONES PITY GOES OUT TO ALL OF THEM ANNAMITE SENEGALESE
OR ALGERIAN WHO HELPED TO CONVEY THE NEWLY RELEASED IRISH FOR EIGHT
HOURS OVER FIFTY JOLTING MILES THE BATTALION FOUND GOOD BILLETS FOR
THEMSELVES AND THE BRIGADE MACHINEGUN COMPANY IN HORNOY ITSELF
WHERE THE INHABITANTS SHOWED THEM NO SMALL KINDNESS OWING TO SMALL
NUMBERS OFFICERS WERE IN ONE MESS SAYS THE DIARY AND ONE CAN SEE
THE EXPANSION OF THAT SMALL AND SHRUNKEN COMPANY AS THE NEW DRAFTS
COME IN AND TRAINING PICKS UP AGAIN

ON THE 3RD OCTOBER 2ND LIEUTENANTS J J FITZWILLIAM MURPHY AND J
N NASH JOINED ON THE 4TH THE REVEREND P J LANEFOX JOINED FOR
DUTY ON THE 5TH 2ND LIEUTENANT THE HON D OBRIEN CAME IN SICK

A L BAIN H H MAXWELL AND J J KANE ALL CAME IN WITHIN THE
NEXT TEN DAYS CAPTAIN R G C YERBURGH ON REJOINING FROM THE
CENTRAL TRAINING SCHOOL AT HAVRE WAS POSTED TO THE COMMAND OF NO 4
COMPANY AND ON THE 8TH OCTOBER A TEAM CHIEFLY OFFICERS GREATLY
DARING PLAYED A RUGBY FOOTBALL MATCH AGAINST A NEIGHBOURING
FRENCH RECRUIT BATTALION WHICH CAMPAIGN SEEMS TO HAVE SO INSPIRED
THEM THAT THEY ALL ATTENDED A DIVISIONAL DINNER THAT NIGHT AT 1ST
BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS AT DROMESNIL THERE IS ALAS NO RECORD OF THAT
MATCH NOR OF WHAT THE FRENCH RECRUIT BATTALION THOUGHT OF IT BUT
JUST BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE FROM HORNOY THEY PLAYED A SOCCER MATCH
AGAINST THE 26TH FRENCH INFANTRY AND NEXT DAY THE CO AND ALL
COMPANY OFFICERS RODE OVER TO THAT REGIMENT TO SEE HOW IT PRACTISED
THE LATEST FORM OF ATTACK OVER THE OPEN THUS DID THEY COMBINE
INSTRUCTION WITH AMUSEMENT AND CEMENTED THE SACRED ALLIANCE

THEY DINED ALSO WITH THEIR OWN 2ND BATTALION WHO WERE BILLETED
FIVE MILES AWAYA HIGH AND IMPORTANT FUNCTION AT HORNOY WHERE
BRIGADIERGENERAL BUTLER FORMERLY IN COMMAND OF THE 2ND BATTALION
WAS PRESENT WITH ALL THE OFFICERS OF BOTH BATTALIONS THE BAND OF
THE WELSH GUARDS ASSISTED AND THEY ALL DRANK THE HEALTH AMONG MANY
OTHERS OF THE BELLE OF HORNOY WHO RESPONDED WITH ENTHUSIASM
FURTHER THEY PLAYED A FOOTBALL MATCH AGAINST THEIR BRETHREN AND WON
ENTERTAINED THE VILLAGE NOT FORGETTING THE 26TH FRENCH INFANTRY
WITH THEIR DRUMS DROVE ALL RANKS HARD AT COMPANY DRILLS AND
BATTALION ATTACKS REHEARSED THE REVIEW FOR THE APPROACHING VISIT OF
HRH THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT AND WELCOMED SMALL DETACHMENTS AS THEY
CAME IN THE LAST WAS 2ND LIEUTENANT D A B MOODIE WITH 50 ON THE
26TH OCTOBER WHEN LIEUTENANT H F S LAW REJOINED THE BATTALION
FROM HIS INTELLIGENCE DUTIES WITH THE NINTH CORPS DRILLSERGEANT J
ORR ASSUMED THE DUTIES OF 2ND LIEUTENANT FROM NOVEMBER 2

THE MESS WAS NOW FULL AGAIN THE DEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER SOMME HAD
ALMOST PASSED OUT OF MENS MEMORIES TILL THE WAR SHOULD BE OVER
AND THE GHOSTS RETURN AND THE BATTALION IMMORTAL HOWEVER MUCH IT
CHANGES WAS READY FORTY OVER STRENGTH FOR THE BITTER WINTER OF
1617

ON THE 7TH NOVEMBER THEY WERE WARNED TO MOVE BACK INTO LINE AND
CELEBRATED IT BY AN OFFICERS DINNER THIRTYSEVEN STRONG OF BOTH
BATTALIONS AT THE HOTEL LONDON HORNOY

ON THE 10TH THEY REGRETFULLY QUITTED THAT HOSPITABLE VILLAGE FOR
THE TOO FAMILIAR CAMPING GROUNDS NEAR CARNOY BEYOND MAULTE WHICH
IN WINTER BECOMES A MARSH ON THE LEAST PROVOCATION THEY WERE
ACCOMMODATED IN BELLTENTS IN A SEA OF MUD WITH WEATHER TO MATCH

NEXT DAY 11TH NOVEMBER THEY SHIFTED TO A SORT OF CAMP NEAR
MONTAUBAN QUITE INADEQUATE AND SERVED BY BOTTOMLESS ROADS WHERE
THEY WERE SHELLED A LITTLE AFTER MASSA PROOF ONE PRESUMES THAT
THE ENEMY HAD NEWS OF THEIR ARRIVAL

ON THE 13TH NOVEMBER IN COLD BUT DRY WEATHER THEY TOOK OVER A LINE
OF TRENCH NORTH OF LESBUFS BETWEEN THAT VILLAGE AND GUEUDECOURT
THESE WERE REACHED BY INTERMINABLE DUCKBOARDS FROM TRNES WOOD
AND UP OVER THE BATTERED AND HACKED FLERS RIDGE THERE WERE NO
COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES AND IN THAT WINDY WASTE OF DEAD WEED AND
WRECKAGE NO LANDMARKS TO GUIDE THE EYE TRENCH EQUIPMENT WAS
UTTERLY LACKING AND EVERY STICK AND STRAND HAD TO BE MANHANDLED
UP FROM GINCHY IN THESE DELECTABLE LODGINGS THEY RELIEVED THE 7TH
YORKSHIRES AND THE 8TH SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRES LOSING ONE MAN WOUNDED
BY SHELLFIRE AND MAJOR THE HON T E VESEY WAS SENT DOWN SICK AS
THE RESULT OF OLD WOUNDS RECEIVED AT LOOS AND IN 14 THE SOMME WAS
NO PLACE FOR SUCH AS WERE NOT ABSOLUTELY FIT AND EVEN THE FITTEST
HAD TO PAY TOLL

SHELLING FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS WAS CONTINUOUS BUT
INDISCRIMINATE FOUR MEN WERE KILLED FOURTEEN WOUNDED AND THREE
DISAPPEAREDWALKED IT IS SUPPOSED INTO ENEMY GROUND THE WONDER
WAS THERE WERE NOT MORE SUCH ACCIDENTS WISER MEN THAN THEY WOULD
COME UP TO THE FRONT LINE WITH A MESSAGE REFUSE THE SERVICES OF
A GUIDE BACK BECAUSE THEY PROTESTED THEY KNEW EVERY INCH OF THE
GROUND ANDWOULD BE NO MORE SEEN TILL EXHUMATION PARTIES THREE OR
FOUR YEARS LATER IDENTIFIED THEM BY SOME RAG OF GUARDS KHAKI OR A
BUTTON

THE BATTALION WAS RELIEVED BY THE 2ND GRENADIERS AT MIDNIGHT 16TH
NOVEMBER BUT WERE NOT CLEAR TILL MORNING WHEN THEY CRAWLED BACK TO
CAMP BETWEEN CARNOY AND MONTAUBAN PACKED FORTY MEN APIECE INTO THE
ICYCHILL NISSEN HUTS SUPPOSED TO HOLD THIRTY AND WERE THANKFUL FOR
THE FOUL WARMTH OF THEM THENCE THEY MOVED INTO UNSTABLE TENTS ON
THE OUTSKIRTS OF MAULTE ON THE BRAY ROAD WHERE THE WIND FUNNELS
FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COMPASS AND IN ALTERNATE SNOW RAIN AND SNOW
AGAIN PLUMBED THE DEEPS OF DISCOMFORT WHEN FROST PUT A CRUST ON THE
GROUND THEY DRILLED WHEN IT BROKE THEY CLEANED THEMSELVES FROM MUD
AND FAIR OR FOUL DID THEIR BEST TO IMPROVE ANY CAMP INTO WHICH
FORTUNE DECANTED THEM

IT WAS A TEST WERE ONE NEEDED THAT PROVED ALL RANKS TO THE
UTTERMOST THE HEROISM THAT ENDURES FOR A DAY OR A WEEK AT HIGH
TENSION IS A SMALL THING BESIDE THAT HABIT OF MIND WHICH CAN HOLD
FAST TO MANNER JUSTICE HONOUR AND A SHOW OF KINDLINESS AND
TOLERATION IN DESPITE OF PHYSICAL MISERY AND THE SLOW PASSAGE
OF BLEAK AND INDISTINGUISHABLE DAYS CHARACTER AND PERSONALITY
WHATEVER ITS CRIMESHEET MAY HAVE BEEN WAS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN
GOLD ON THE SOMME WHERE A JEST COUNTED AS HIGH AS A RUMRATION
ALL SORTS OF UNSUSPECTED PEOPLE CAME TO THEIR OWN AS LEADERS OF MEN
OR LIGHTENERS OF CARE THERE WERE STRETCHERBEARERS FOR INSTANCE
WHOSE MERE PRESENCE AND PERSONALITY STEADIED HALF A PLATOON AFTER THE
SHELLBURST WHEN PICKING THEMSELVES UP MENS FIRST QUESTION OUT OF
THE DARK WOULD BE WHERES SOANDSO AND SOANDSO WOULD ANSWER
WITH THE DIGNITY OF MILESIAN KINGS IM HERE CAARRY ON LADS

SO TOO WITH THE OFFICERS IN THE LONG OVERSEEING OF ENDLESS
FATIGUES WHICH ARE MORE TRYING THAN ACTION THEY COME TO UNDERSTAND
THE MEN WITH A THOROUGHNESS THAT ONE IS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT
NOT MANY CORPS HAVE REACHED DISCIPLINE IN THE GUARDS AS HAS BEEN
MANY TIMES POINTED OUT ALLOWED NO EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR THE OFFICER
OR THE MAN BUT ONCE THE PUNISHMENT OR THE TELLING OFF HAD BEEN
ADMINISTERED THE SINNER AND THE JUDGE COULD AND DID DISCUSS
EVERYTHING UNDER HEAVEN ONE EXPLANATION WHICH STRIKES AT THE ROOT OF
THE MATTER IS THIS YELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN THOSE DAYS WE WAS ALL
COUNTIN OURSELVES FOR DEAD MENSOONER OR LATER TWAS IN THE AIR
YELL UNDERSTANDLIKE THE BIG STUFF COMIN OVER

ON SUNDAY THE 27TH NOVEMBER THE DAY OF THE REQUIEM MASS FOR THE
IRISH GUARDS IN WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL A REQUIEM MASS WAS SAID IN
MAULTE CHURCH AND THEY MOVED OUT TO A FRENCH CAMP FORKED TREE
SOUTH OF THE TOWN WHERE THE BIG FRENCH HUTS HELD A HUNDRED MEN
APIECE BUT COOKHOUSES ETC WERE ALL TO BUILD AND THE USUAL
ROUTINE IMPROVEMENT WORK BEGAN AGAIN THEIR BRIGADE BOMBING OFFICER
LIEUTENANT THE HON H P OBRIEN WAS APPOINTED STAFF CAPTAIN TO THE
1ST GUARDS BRIGADE AND CAPTAIN R G C YERBURGH LEFT TO BE ATTACHED
TO THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE HQ STAFF FOR INSTRUCTION IN STAFF DUTIES

THEY WERE VISITED BY THEIR CORPS AND DIVISIONAL COMMANDERS INSPECTED
BY THEIR BRIGADIER AND ROUTEMARCHED TILL THE 3RD DECEMBER WHEN THEY
MOVED TO MALTZ HORN CAMP

IT HAD BEEN DECIDED THAT THE BRITISH ARMY SHOULD BY DEGREES TAKE
OVER A STRETCH OF THE FRENCH LINE FROM LE TRANSLOY TO A POINT
OPPOSITE ROYE AND THE BATTALIONS SHARE OF THIS WAS ABOUT A THOUSAND
YARDS OF TRENCH AT SAILLYSAILLISEL HELD BY THE 160TH REGIMENT OF
THE TWENTIETH CORPS CORPS DE FER THE FRONT LINE RAN A LITTLE IN
FRONT OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN THAT LONG AND PROSPEROUS VILLAGE ON
THE RIDGE AND THOUGH NOT CONTINUOUS IT HELD IN PLACES THE
SUPPORTLINE THROUGH AND AMONG THE WRECK OF THE HOUSES WAS DRY AND
FAIRLY GOOD THAT THERE WERE NO COMMUNICATIONTRENCHES WAS A SMALL
MATTERMEN PREFERRED TO TAKE THEIR CHANCES IN THE OPEN TO BEING
BURIED IN TRENCH MUDBUT THERE WAS NO ROAD UP TO IT AND THE GOING
WAS HEAVY

ONCE INSTALLED DECEMBER 6 AFTER A PROMPT AND WORKMANLIKE FRENCH
RELIEF WHICH IMPRESSED THEM THEY FOUND THE 156TH FRENCH INFANTRY
ON THEIR RIGHT A COLDSTREAM BATTALION ON THEIR LEFT AND AN
ENEMY IN FRONT DISPOSED TO BE QUIET EXCEPT WHEN FRIGHTENED OR
SUSPECTING RELIEFS WHEN HE WOULD DROP VERY UNPLEASANT BARRAGES ON
THE SUPPORTLINE

THEY WERE RELIEVED ON THE 9TH DECEMBER BY THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHO WERE
LATE BECAUSE THEY WERE CONSTANTLY DELAYED BY DIGGING MEN OUT OF
MUD FROM BOIS DE LA HAIE THE LONG THIN SLIP OF WOOD UNDER MORVAL
WHENCE THE RELIEF STARTED AT A QUARTERPAST FIVE IN THE EVENING THE
DISTANCE TO THE BATTALIONS SECTOR MIGHT BE TWO MILES THAT RELIEF
WAS NOT COMPLETED TILL HALFPAST ONE ON THE MORNING OF THE 10THSAY
EIGHT HOURS TO COVER FOUR OR FIVE MILES IN ONE CONTINUOUS NIGHTMARE
OF MUD DARKNESS LOSS OF TOUCH AND THE SUDDEN ENGULFMENT OF HEAVILY
LOADED MEN A GRENADIER BATTALION CLAIMS TO HOLD THE RECORD FIFTEEN
HOURS FOR THE EXTRICATION OF ONE MAN SIX OR EIGHT HOURS WAS NOT
UNCOMMON THEY WERE SHELLED OF COURSE ON THEIR ARRIVAL AND LOST

ON THE 12TH DECEMBER AFTER A DAYS REST IN A MUDDY CAMP NEAR
MONTAUBAN THEY MARCHED TO COMBLES THROUGH THE BLACKENED SITE OF
GUILLEMONT TO RELIEVE THE 2ND BATTALION ON A MORE SOUTHERLY SECTOR
TO FURNISH WORKINGPARTIES FOR THE RAILWAY LINES THAT WERE SPREADING
STEALTHILY NORTH AND EAST TO HELP LAY DOWN PLANK ROADSNOT THE
LEAST BURDENSOME OF FATIGUES FOR THE PLANKS WERE SUBSTANTIAL
LOGSAND TO MAKE THE FRONT LINE A LITTLE LESS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS AN
EASY TURN WITH VERY LITTLE SHELLING OR SNIPING BOTH SIDES BEING
ONLY ABLE TO REACH THEIR FRONT LINE BY GOING OVER THE OPEN WHEN
TO THIS IS ADDED FULL MOONLIGHT AND A FALL OF SNOW MODERATION IS
IMPOSED ON EVERY ONE TILL THEY ARE UNDER COVER OTHERWISE A LOCAL
BATTLE MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPEDAND WHAT IS THE USE OF LOCAL BATTLES
WHERE BOTH SIDES ARE STUCK IN THE MUD AND NO HELP CAN BE SENT TO
EITHER THIS QUESTION WOULD BE PUT TO THE STAFF WHEN FROM THE
COMFORTABLE SECURITY OF THEIR DECENT DUGOUTS THEY LECTURED THE
FRONTLINE AND WERE INVITED MIRTHFULLY TO COME UP AND EXPERIMENT FOR
THEMSELVES

THE BATTALION HAD ELEVEN WOUNDED IN THREE DAYS AND RETURNED TO
BRONFAY TO FIND THEIR ALLOTTED CAMP ALREADY FILLED UP BY GUNNERS
THEN THERE WAS CONFUSION AND ARGUMENT AND THE QUARTERMASTERNOTABLE
EVEN AMONG QUARTERMASTERSPROCURED FUEL AND BRAZIERS AND GOT
THE MEN MORE OR LESS WARMED AND FED THE MUDDLE SAYS THE DIARY
STERNLY WAS DUE TO NO PROPER ARRANGEMENTS BEING MADE TO FIND OUT TO
WHOM CAMP 108 BELONGED BEFORE THE BATTALIONS WERE MOVED INTO THEM
THUS ON PAPER AT LEAST DID THE FRONT LINE GET BACK AT THE STAFF

THEY RETURNED TO THE COMBLES AREA ON THE 18TH RELIEVED THEIR
SISTERBATTALION IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS AND IN FINE FROSTY
WEATHER HELPED BY THE ENEMYS INACTIVITY IMPROVED THE TRENCHES
LOST FIVE KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED AND ON THEIR RETURN FOUND CAMP 108
ALSO IMPROVED AND DEVOID OF GUNNERS

THE YEAR CLOSED WELL THEIR CHRISTMAS TURN DECEMBER 2527 WHEN THEY
MISSED THEIR CHRISTMAS DINNERS WAS ALMOST BLOODLESS THE RELIEFS
WENT SMOOTHLY AND THOUGH A THAW MADE THE TRENCHES CAVE HERE AND
THERE BUT FOUR MEN WERE WOUNDED AND IN THEIR NEW YEAR TURN ONLY
ONE

ABOUT CHRISTMAS THE BRIGADE TO THEIR DEEP REGRET LOST THEIR
BRIGADIERGENERAL C PEREIRAPROMOTED TO COMMAND THE SECOND
DIVISION AND IN HIM ONE OF THE BEST FRIENDS THAT THEY EVER HAD HE
KNEW THE BATTALION VERY PERSONALLY APPRECIATED ITS VALUE AND FOUGHT
FOR ITS INTERESTS WITH DEVOTION AND A STRONG HAND

NOTHING IS SAID IN THE DIARY OF ANY ATTEMPTS ON THE ENEMYS PART TO
FRATERNISE AND THE NEW YEAR WAS SEEN IN WITHOUT ANY INCIDENT
WHICH MEANS THAT NO BURSTS OF ARTILLERY MARKED THE HOUR AND ON THE
3RD JANUARY THE WHOLE OF THE GUARDS DIVISION WENT OUT OF THE LINE FOR
REFIT THE TWENTIETH DIVISION TOOK ITS UNENVIED PLACE AND THE 1ST
BATTALION IRISH GUARDS LAY AT SANDPITS CAMP NEAR MAULTE

THE STRAIN WAS BEGINNING TO TELL THEY HAD HAD TO TRANSFER LIEUTENANT
F S L SMITH AND 2ND LIEUTENANT J KANE TO THE 2ND BATTALION OWING
TO SHORTAGE IN THAT BATTALION ON ACCOUNT OF SICKNESS AND THEIR OWN
COOLIES WERE IN NEED OF REST AND CHANGE THE STRONGEST CANNOT STAND

FAULT MEMORY BRINGS BACK THE FACE OR THE EYES OF THE DYING AND THE

CONVINCED THAT HIS NEXT TURN OF DUTY WILL SEE ALL HIS MEN DESTROYED
BY HIS OWN ACT BETWEEN THIS LAST STAGE AND THE DRAGGING WEARINESS

AND THAT DISCIPLINE WHICH AGE AND EXPERIENCE HAVE DEVISED TO HOLD HIM
WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE HAS DROPPED AWAY IT IS THE DEADLY JOURNEY BACK
AND FORTH TO THE FRONTLINE WITH MATERIAL THE KNOWN AND FORESEEN
WAR IN DARKNESS AND MUD AGAINST THE NATURAL PERVERSITY OF THINGS
THAT SHIFTS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SOUL SO THAT A MAN WHO SCARCELY

THE SOMME WAS ONE OVERWHELMING FATIGUE




1917

THE SOMME TO GOUZEAUCOURT


THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR SAW THE BRITISH ARMIES NOW MORE THAN FIFTY
DIVISIONS STRONG HOLDING A FRONT OF A HUNDRED AND TEN MILES FROM
YPRES TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF ROYE THUS ALLOWING FOR CHANGES
IMPOSED BY THE FLUCTUATIONS OF WAR AND ATTACK THEY LAY

THE SECOND ARMY HAD THE SALIENT THE FIRST CENTRED ON ARMENTIRES
THE THIRD GOUGHS CARRIED ON TO THE SOUTH OF ARRAS WHERE THE FIFTH
HELD ALL ALONG THE VALLEY OF THE ANCRE AND A PORTION OF THE OLD
BRITISH LINE ON THE SOMME THE FOURTH JOINED THE FRENCH LEFT WING
NEAR ROYE AND THE FRENCH PRESSURE WORKED IN WITH OURS

FROM THE SALIENT TO THE SOMME BATTLEFRONT OUR LINES BUSINESS WAS
TO DRAW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OF THE ENEMYS STRENGTH THEREFORE OUR
RAIDS ON THAT PART OF THE LINE DURING THE LATTER HALF OF 1916 WERE
COUNTED BY THE HUNDRED AND IN ALL THAT TIME AT NO POINT ON ANY
GIVEN DAY THERE COULD THE GERMANS FEEL SECURE AGAINST OUR IRRUPTIONS

ON THE SOMME OUR PRESSURE WAS DIRECT AND EXCEPT FOR THE WEATHER
WORKED AS CONTINUOUSLY AS A FOREST FIRE IN FALLEN PINENEEDLES A
FOLD OF THE HILLS MIGHT CHECK IT THERE A BARE RIDGE OR A SODDEN
VALLEY HOLD IT ELSEWHERE FOR THE WHILE BUT ALWAYS IT ATE NORTH
AND EAST ACROSS THE STRICKEN COUNTRY AS DIVISION AFTER DIVISION
GATHERED FOUGHT WON FOOTHOLD HELD IT DUG IN AND GAVE PLACE TO
THEIR UNSPENT FELLOWS BENEATH THE COVER OF THE ADVANCING GUNS HERE
IS A MERE OUTLINE OF THE WORK OF A FEW WEEKS

THE AFFAIRS OF THE 15TH AND 25TH OF SEPTEMBER 1916 WHEN THE FOURTH
ARMY PUSHED THE LINE PAST LESBUFS AND FLERS AND BEYOND GUEUDECOURT
ON THE RIGHT KNOCKED OUT AS WE KNOW BOTH BATTALIONS OF THE IRISH
GUARDS FOR THE TIME BEING

ON THE 27TH AND 28TH OF SEPTEMBER THE SECOND AND FIRST CANADIAN
DIVISIONS WITH THE ELEVENTH AND EIGHTEENTH OF THE SECOND ARMY CORPS
CAPTURED THIEPVAL THE STUFF AND SCHWABEN REDOUBTS ON THE LEFT OF THE
LINE WHILE THE FIFTYFIFTH AND NEW ZEALAND DIVISIONS MADE POSSIBLE
AN ADVANCE ON LE SARS AND EAUCOURT LABBAYE VILLAGES IN THE CENTRE
WHICH AFTER FOUR DAYS CONTINUOUS FIGHTING BY THE FORTYSEVENTH
FIFTIETH AND TWENTYTHIRD DIVISIONS ENDED IN THE TAKING OF EAUCOURT
LABBAYE AND LE SARS

ON THE 7TH OF OCTOBER THE FRENCH ARMY ATTACKED IN THE DIRECTION
OF SAILLYSAILLISEL THE FOURTH ARMY CHIMING IN ALONG ITS WHOLE
FRONT FROM LESBUFS TO DESTREMONT FARM WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE
TWENTYTHIRD DIVISION ON THE 29TH SEPTEMBER IN THIS AFFAIR THE
TWENTYTHIRD DIVISION CAPTURED LE SARS AND THE TWENTIETH DIVISION
OVER A MILE OF TRENCHES EAST OF GUEUDECOURT

THEN THE TREACHEROUS WEATHER BROKE ONCE MORE AND THE BATTERED AND
CRUMBLED GROUND HELD THEIR FEET TILL A FEW DAYS OF DRY COLD WERE
SNATCHED FOR AN ATTACK IN THE DIRECTION OF COURCELETTE BY FOUR
DIVISIONS FOURTH CANADIAN EIGHTEENTH FIFTEENTH AND THIRTYNINTH
WHERE A FRESH LINE WAS NEEDED

ON THE 23RD OCTOBER AND ON THE 5TH NOVEMBER AGAIN AS SIDEISSUES
WHILE WAITING ON THE WEATHER FOR A SERIOUS ATTACK ON BEAUMONTHAMEL
A COUPLE OF DIVISIONS FOURTH AND EIGHTH WENT IN WITH A FRENCH
ATTACK AGAINST PIERRE ST VAAST WOOD WHERE A TANGLE OF ENEMY
TRENCHES AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO ARMIES WAS SLOWLY SMOKED AND
BURNED OUT

THE 10TH OF NOVEMBER AFTER ONE DAYS FINE WEATHER GAVE THE FOURTH
CANADIAN DIVISION A FULL DAYS FIGHTING AND ONCE MORE A THOUSAND
YARDS OF TRENCH IN THE COURCELETTE SECTOR

ON THE 13TH OF NOVEMBER THE BATTLE OF THE ANCRE OPENED FROM SERRE
TO EAST OF THE SCHWABEN REDOUBT THIRTYFIRST THIRD SECOND
FIFTYFIRST THIRTYNINTH AND NINETEENTH DIVISIONS WITH THE
INTENTION OF GAINING COMMAND OF BOTH BANKS OF THE RIVER WHERE IT
ENTERED THE ENEMY LINES SIX OR SEVEN MILES NORTH OF ALBERT THIS
WAS A SECTOR OF THE OLD GERMAN FRONT TO THE WEST WHICH HAD THROWN
BACK OUR OPENING ATTACK OF JULY 1 AND HAD GROWN NO MORE INVITING
SINCE SERRE ITSELF HELPED BY THE STATE OF THE GROUND BEFORE IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE BUT BEAUCOURT BEAUMONTHAMEL AND A PORTION OF THE HIGH
GROUND ABOVE IT WITH THE VILLAGE OF ST PIERREDIVION IN THE VALLEY
WERE IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS CAPTURED AND HELD

ALL THE ABOVE TAKES NO COUNT OF INCESSANT MINOR OPERATIONS LOSSES
AND RECAPTURES OF TRENCHES DAYS AND NIGHTS OF BOMBING THAT WERE
NECESSARY TO SILENCE NESTS OF SUBTERRANEAN WORKS MARKED ON THE MAPS
OF PEACE AS VILLAGES NOR OF THE ALMOST MONOTONOUS COUNTERATTACKS
THAT FOLLOWED ON THE HEELS OF EVERY GAIN SO LONG AS MOVEMENT WAS
POSSIBLE THE SOMME FRONT WAS ALIVE FROM END TO END ACCORDING AS ONE
HARDGAINED POSITION GAVE THE KEY TO THE NEXT OR UNSCREENED SOME
HITHERTO BLINDED WORKS AGAINST EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF WEATHER AND
OVER GROUND NO TROOPS IN HISTORY HAD BEFORE DARED TO USE AT THAT
SEASON THE SYSTEM AND DESIGN OF THE ADVANCE REVEALED ITSELF TO THE
ENEMY THEIR COUNTERATTACKS WITHERED UNDER OUR GUNS OR DIED OUT IN
THE FUMING RAWDUG TRENCHES THE SLOPES THAT HAD BEEN THEIR SCREENS
WERE CROWNED AND TURNED AGAINST THEM THEIR INFANTRY BEGAN TO HAVE
NO LOVE FOR THE BLUNTNOSED TANKS WHICH THOUGH NOT YET COME TO
THE WAR IN BATTALIONS WERE DRAGGING THEIR SMEARED TRAILS ALONG THE
RIDGES THE FIGHTING AEROPLANES WORRIED THEM TOO WITH MACHINEGUN
FIRE FROM OVERHEAD PHOTOGRAPHERS MARKED THEIR COVERED WAYS BY DAY
AND OUR HEAVY BOMBERS SEARCHED THEM BY NIGHT AS OWLS SEARCH STUBBLE
FOR MICE IT ALL COST MEN AND STUFF AND THE GERMAN ARMY COMMAND HAD
LITTLE GOOD NEWS TO SEND BACK TO THE GERMAN TRIBES

YET THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF 1916 HAD ADVANCED OUR FRONT NO MORE THAN
SOME EIGHT MILESALONG THE ALBERTBAPAUME ROAD AT NO POINT WERE
WE MORE THAN TEN MILES FROM OUR BEGINNINGS ALL THAT SHOWED ON THE
MAP WAS THAT THE ENEMYS LINE TO THE NORTH HAD BEEN PINCHED INTO
A SALIENT WHICH STARTING FROM JUST EAST OF ARRAS FOLLOWED THE
LINE OF THE OLD GERMAN FRONT BUILT UP TWO YEARS BEFORE THROUGH
MONCHYAUBOIS GOMIECOURT AND SERRE TO THE HIGH WHITE GROUNDS
ABOVE BEAUMONTHAMEL THENCE IT TURNED EAST ACROSS THE ANCRE
SEVEN OR EIGHT KILOMETRES NORTH OF ARRAS SKIRTED GRANDCOURT
CROSSED THE ARROWSTRAIGHT ALBERTBAPAUME ROAD BY THE DREARY BUTTE
DE WARLENCOURT RAN NORTHEAST OF GUEUDECOURT AND ON THE RIM OF
THE RISE ABOVE LE TRANSLOY TILL IT CROSSED THE PRONNEBAPAUME
ROAD JUST NORTH OF SAILLYSAILLISEL HERE IT SWUNG SOUTHEAST FROM
RANCOURT AND BOUCHAVESNES DOWN THE LONG SLOPES TO THE VALLEY OF THE
SOMME AND ITS MARSHES WEST OF PRONNE THENCE SOUTHWESTERLY BY
BERNYENSANTERRE ABLAINCOURT TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF CHAULNES ENDING
AT LE QUESNOYENSANTERRE WHERE THE FRENCH TOOK ON THE TWENTYFIVE
MILE STRETCH FROM LE TRANSLOY TO LE QUESNOY WAS THE NEW SECTION THAT
HAD BEEN HANDED OVER TO THE BRITISH CARE PIECE BY PIECE AT THE END
OF THE YEAR

TO MEET THIS PINCH AND ALL THAT THEY COULD SEE THAT IT MEANT
THE GERMANS HAD CONSTRUCTED WHILE THEY AND THE WEATHER HELD US
ELABORATE SECOND AND THIRD LINES OF DEFENCE BEHIND THEIR HEAVILY
FORTIFIED FRONT THE FIRST BARRIERA DOUBLE LINE OF TRENCHES
HEAVILY WIRED RAN BEHIND SAILLYSAILLISEL PAST LE TRANSLOY TO
THE ALBERTBAPAUME ROAD GRVILLERS AND LOUPART WOODS AND VIA
ACHIETLEPETIT TO BUCQUOY

PARALLEL TO THIS AT A DISTANCE RANGING FROM ONE TO TWO MILES WAS
A NEW LINE THROUGH ROCQUIGNY BAPAUME AND ABLAINZEVELLE ALMOST
EQUALLY STRONG AND ELABORATE BEHIND IT AS EVERY ONE UNDERSTOOD
WAS A THING CALLED THE HINDENBURG LINE KNOWN TO THE GERMANS AS
SIEGFRIEDA FORTYMILE MARVEL OF CONSIDERED DEFENCES WITH BRANCHES
AND SPURS AND SWITCHES ONE END OF WHICH LAY ON ST QUENTIN AND THE
OTHER OUTSIDE ARRAS THIS COULD BE DEALT WITH LATER BUT MEANTIME
THE ENEMY IN THE ARRASLE TRANSLOY SALIENT WERE UNEASY THE ATTACKS
DELIVERED ON SELECTED POSITIONS THE LITTLE INTERRELATED OPERATIONS
THAT STOLE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRENCH OR HALF A VILLAGE AT A LEAP
OR CARRIED A GUNGROUP TO A POSITION WHENCE OUR BATTERIES COULD
PEER OUT AND PUNISH ABOVE ALL THE COLD KNOWLEDGE THAT SOONER OR
LATER OUR UNIMAGINATIVE UNMILITARY INFANTRY WOULD SHAMBLE AFTER
THE GUNS MADE THEM THINK WELL OF LINES IN THEIR REAR TO WHICH THEY
COULD RETIRE AT LEISURE VERDUN HAD NOT FALLEN VERY MANY OF THEIR
MEN LAY DEAD OUTSIDE ITS OBLITERATED FORTS AND SO VERY MANY LIVING
WERE NEEDED TO MAKE GOOD THE DAILY DRAIN OF THE SOMME THAT THEY HAD
NONE TOO MANY TO SPARE FOR AUSTRIAN OR TURKISH NEEDS THEIR ONE
ENERGETIC ALLY WAS THE WEATHER WHICH WITH ALMOST COMIC REGULARITY
GAVE THEM TIME AFTER EACH REVERSE TO DRAW BREATH POSITION MORE GUNS
REORGANISE RELIEFS AND EXPLAIN TO THEIR DOUBTING PUBLIC IN GERMANY
THE EXCELLENCE AND THE METHOD OF THEIR ARMYS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
THE BATTLE OF THE ANCRE FOR INSTANCE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN ABSOLUTE
DEADLOCK OF SIX WEEKS WHEN OUR ARMIESONE CANNOT ASSAULT AND DIG
OUT BATTALIONS AT THE SAME TIMEDROPPED EVERYTHING TO FIGHT THE MUD
WHILE OUR FRONTLINE WALLOWED IN BOTTOMLESS TRENCHES WHERE SUBALTERNS
TOOK FROM THREE TO SIX HOURS TO VISIT THEIR POSTS ON A FRONT OF ONE
QUARTER OF A MILE

BITTER FROSTS SET IN WITH THE FIRST WEEKS OF THE NEW YEAR AND THE
SMALL OPERATIONS BEGAN AT ONCE ON OUR SIDE ROUND SUCH PORTIONS
OF THE BEAUMONTHAMEL HEIGHTS AS THE ENEMY STILL CLUNG TO HERE THE
THIRD SEVENTH AND ELEVENTH DIVISIONS FOUGHT SHIFT BY SHIFT FOR
THE REST OF JANUARY AND WON THE HIGH GROUND NEEDED FOR OUR GUNS TO
UNCOVER AGAINST SERRE AND GRANDCOURT WHICH WERE THE KEYS OF THE
POSITIONS AT THE CORNER OF THE ARRASLE TRANSLOY SALIENT THANKS
TO OUR AIRWORK AND THE ALMOST DAILY IMPROVEMENT IN THE POWER AND
PRECISION OF OUR BARRAGES THAT LITTLE ARMY CAME THROUGH ITS CAMPAIGN
WITHOUT TOO HEAVY LOSSES AND STILL FURTHER CRAMPED THE ENEMYS
FOOTHOLD ALONG THE ANCRE WHILE THE REST OF THE LINE ENJOYED AS MUCH
PEACE AS THE SOMME ALLOWED THEM WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING DOING


MARKING TIME

THE GUARDS DIVISION AFTER THEIR TEN DAYS REST AND CLEANUP AT
SANDPITS CAMP MAULTE SUPPLIED ONE BRIGADE TO TAKE OVER A NEW
SECTOR OF TRENCH OPPOSITE ST PIERRE VAAST WOOD ON THE EXTREME
EAST OF THINGS AND LEFT THEIR 1ST BRIGADE IN RESERVE AT MAULTE
VILLESOUSCORBIE AND MRICOURT LABB THE LATTER CAMP WAS ALLOTTED
TO THE IRISH GUARDS WHO HAD TO SEND ONE COMPANY FOR PERMANENT
FATIGUES TO THE RAILWAY STATIONALL THE VALLEY HERE WAS ONE LONG
SIDING FOR MEN AND SUPPLIESAND ANOTHER TO THE BACK OF BERNAFAY WOOD
FOR DECAUVILLE CONSTRUCTION WHILE THE REMAINDER WERE DRILLED AND
INSTRUCTED IN THEIR SPECIALTIES THIS WAS THE TIME IN OUR ARMIES
DEVELOPMENT WHEN NEARLY EVERY THIRD MAN WAS A SPECIALIST IN SOME
BRANCH OR ANOTHER EXCEPT AS COMPANY OFFICERS REMARKED UNDER THEIR
BREATHS THE RIFLE AND ITS BAYONET THE MENS DEFERRED CHRISTMAS
DINNERS IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THEY HAD BEEN IN THE LINE ON THE DAY
ITSELF WERE DULY ISSUED BY HALF A BATTALION AT A TIME IN THE BIG
CINEMAHALL IN CAMP AND LEST THE TRANSPORT OFFICER SHOULD BY ANY
CHANCE ENJOY HIMSELF THEIR TRANSPORT CHOSE THIS TIME OF REST TO
DEVELOP CONTAGIOUS STOMATITIS A FORM OF THRUSH IN THE MOUTH AND
HAD TO BE ISOLATED STILL SETTING ASIDE THE COLD WHICH DOES NOT
MUCH TROUBLE WELLFED MEN THE BATTALION HAD SOME PLEASANT MEMORIES
OF ITS REST BY THE RIVER LEAVE WAS POSSIBLE SMOKINGPARTIES MADE
THEMSELVES IN THE BIG HUTS THE SERGEANTS GAVE A DINNER WHICH IS A
SURE SIGN OF WELLBEING THERE WERE CINEMAS FOR THE MEN AND NO ONE
TROUBLED HIMSELF TOO MUCH FOR THE NOISE OF THE GUNS TEN MILES UP
STREAM

IT IS DIFFICULT TO REDISCOVER A BATTALIONS PSYCHOLOGY AT ANY GIVEN
TIME BUT SO FAR AS EVIDENCE GOES THEY HAD NOT TOO BLACK DOUBTS
AS TO THE UPSHOT OF THE CAMPAIGN THOUGH EVERY PLATOON KEPT ITS
LOUDVOICED PESSIMISTS WHO FORETOLD THAT THEY WOULD TAKE ROOT IN THE
TRENCHES FOR EVERMORE AND CHRISTENED THE ROD LOCOMOTIVES ROLL ON
DURATION

ON THE 1ST FEBRUARY 1917 IN COLD BRIGHT WEATHER WITH SNOW ON THE
GROUND THE 1ST BRIGADE WERE ONCE AGAIN IN DIVISIONAL RESERVE NEAR
CARNOY READY TO RELIEVE THE 3RD COLDSTREAM NEAR RANCOURT ON THE
RECENTLY TAKENOVER FRENCH SECTOR IN TRENCHES A LITTLE WESTERLY
OF ST PIERRE VAAST WOOD WHICH IS UNDER SAILLYSAILLISEL IN THE
WOOD ITSELF LAY A DREADFUL MINECRATER OF THE OLD DAYS FILLED AS
IT SEEMED WITH DEAD FRENCH COLONIAL TROOPSBROWNED AND BLACKENED
BODIES THEIR WHITE SKULLS STILL CARRYING JAUNTY RED CAPS OUR
WONDERING PATROLS USED TO LOOK DOWN INTO IT SOMETIMES OF MOONLIGHT
NIGHTS

THEY MOVED OUT ON THE 2ND OF FEBRUARY VIA MARICOURT AND MAUREPAS
LEFT NO 2 COMPANY UNDER CANVAS IN MAUREPAS RAVINE DISTRIBUTED THE
REST IN SHELTERS AND DUGOUTS AND RESUMED THEIR WATCH THE FROZEN
GROUND STOPPED MUCH DIGGING OR IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ENEMYS FRONT
LINE GAVE NO TROUBLE BUT A FEW SMALL SHELLS WERE SENT OVER ONE
OF WHICH HIT 2ND LIEUTENANT J ORR TEMPORARILY IN COMMAND OF NO 1
COMPANY AND WOUNDED A COUPLE OF MEN THE REST OF THEIR TURNFEBRUARY
2 TO 6WAS QUIET FOR THE NEWFALLEN SNOW GAVE AWAY THE LEAST
MOVEMENT ON EITHER SIDE WHILE THEY CROUCHED OVER THEIR BRAZIERS AND
WATCHED EACH OTHER THE OPERATIONS ROUND SERRE AND AT THE NOSE OF THE
ARRASLE TRANSLOY SALIENT BEGAN AGAIN AS THE EARTHS CRUST HARDENED
THE SIXTYTHIRD DIVISION HAMMERED ITS WAY FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT UP
THE SOUTHERN SLOPES OF SERRE AND OUR GUNS WERE THREATENING THE LINE
OF ENEMYS TRENCHES FROM GRANDCOURT WESTWARD THIS MOVE UNKEYED THE
ARCH OF HIS LOCAL DEFENCES AT THIS POINT AND NEXT DAY HE EVACUATED
GRANDCOURT AND SUCH OF HIS FRONT AS LAY BETWEEN GRANDCOURT AND THE
STUFF REDOUBT

BY THE 7TH FEBRUARY OUR TROOPS HAD CARRIED FORWARD TO MIDWAY BETWEEN
BEAUCOURT AND MIRAUMONT AND ON THE 10TH FEBRUARY THE THIRTYSECOND
DIVISION TOOK IN HAND THE BUSINESS OF SHIFTING THE ENEMY OUT OF WHAT
REMAINED TO HIM IN THE BEAUMONT VALLEY THEIR ADVANCE BROUGHT SERRE
VILLAGE INTO DIRECT DANGER FROM OUR ARTILLERY AND ANY FURTHER MOVE
ON OUR PART UP THE VALLEY OF THE ANCRE WOULD MAKE SERRE UNTENABLE

ON THE 17TH FEBRUARY THAT MOVE WAS MADE BY THREE DIVISIONS SECOND
EIGHTEENTH AND SIXTYTHIRD BEFORE DAWN THROUGH HEAVY MIST ON
THE EDGE OF A THAW AND IN THE FACE OF A WELLCONTRIVED BARRAGE
THAT CAUGHT THE BATTALIONS FORMING UP BUT THE POSITIONS AND
OBSERVATIONPOINTS ALREADY GAINED HELPED OUR GUNS TO HELP THE
INFANTRY BROKE UP THE ENEMYS COUNTERATTACKS WITH SATISFACTORY
LOSSES AND IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS GAVE US GOOD COMMAND OVER THE
ENEMYS ARTILLERY DISPOSITIONS IN THE VALLEY OF THE UPPER ANCRE AND
A FAIR LOOK INTO HIS DEFENCES AT PYS AND MIRAUMONT THEN THE GAME
STOOD THUS IF MIRAUMONT WHICH LAY AT OUR MERCY WERE TAKEN SERRE
WOULD GO IF SERRE WENT PUISIEUXAUMONT AND GOMIECOURT THE PILLAR
OF THE OLD GERMAN WESTERN DEFENCES WOULD BE OPENED TOO AND IT WAS
NO PART OF THE GERMAN IDEA TO CLING TO UNTENABLE POSITIONS WHOSE
LOSS WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED AT HOME WHERE PEOPLE WERE ASKING WHY
VICTORY DELAYED SO LONG NOT ONLY WAS THE WHOLE OF ARRASLE TRANSLOY
SALIENT SHAKING BY NOW THERE WAS THE PROSPECT OF INDEFINITE WASTAGE
TO NO GOOD END ALL ALONG THE REST OF THE SOMME FRONT AND THOUGH
THE WEATHER TILL THEN HAD BLUNTED THE FOLLOWING WEIGHT OF EACH
FOLLOWING BLOW MANY CONSIDERATIONS POINTED TO A TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL
OF A FEW MILES IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE MORE IRRESISTIBLY AT A MORE
FITTING TIME SLOWLY METHODICALLY THEN WITH CAREFUL SCREENS OF
VEILED MACHINEGUNS BEHIND THEM AND A SERIES OF SCIENTIFICALLY
CHOSEN ARTILLERY POSITIONS EQUALLY CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING A
COUNTERATTACK OR CHECKING AND DESTROYING ANY TOO INCONVENIENT
BODY OF PURSUERS THE ENEMY MOVED BACK INTO GROUND NOT YET CHURNED
AND CHANNELLED BY SHELL OR TRAFFIC OVER UNTOUCHED ROADS WHICH HE
HAD KEPT IN PERFECT ORDER TO THIS VERY END AND LEFT US TO FOLLOW
THROUGH BOTTOMLESS VALLEYS OF DESOLATION

THE FROST BROKE ON THE THIRD WEEK OF FEBRUARY AND THE LAST STATE
OF THE GROUND WAS WORSE EVEN THAN IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE RAINY
AUTUMN TRENCHES CAVED IN BODILY DUMPS SANK WHERE THEY WERE BEING
PILED THE DIRT AND THE BUTTRESSES OF OVERHEAD SHELTERS FLAKED AND
FELL AWAY IN LUMPS DUCKBOARDS WENT UNDER BY FURLONGS AT A TIME
TANKS WERE IMMOBILISED FIVE FEET DEEP AND THE VERY BELLIES OF THE
FIELDGUNS GOUGED INTO THE MUD ONLY OUR AIRMEN COULD SEE ANYTHING
BEYOND OR OUTSIDE THE PRESENT EXTREME DISCOMFORT BUT THE MISTS THAT
CAME PUNCTUALLY WITH THE THAWS HELPED TO BAFFLE EVEN THEIR EYES

ON THE 24TH FEBRUARY THE ENEMY HAD EVACUATED HIS POSITIONS IN FRONT
OF PYS MIRAUMONT AND SERRE NEXT DAY HIS FIRST SYSTEM OF DEFENCE
FROM GUEUDECOURT TO WEST OF SERRE RUNNING THROUGH HALFADOZEN
FORTIFIED VILLAGES WAS IN OUR HANDS

AT THE END OF THE MONTH PUISIEUXAUMONT WITH GOMIECOURT AND ITS
DEFENCES WERE OCCUPIED BY US THE GERMANS HAD PULLED THEMSELVES
CLEANLY OUT OF THE WORST OF THE SALIENT

BY MARCH THEY WERE BACK ON THEIR FORTIFIED LE TRANSLOYLOUPART LINE
EXCEPT THAT THEY STILL HELD THE VILLAGE OF IRLES ABOVE MIRAUMONT
WHICH WAS LINKED UP TO THE LE TRANSLOYLOUPART LINE BY A PENINSULA
OF WIRED TRENCHES IRLES WAS CARRIED BY THE SECOND AND EIGHTEENTH
DIVISIONS ON THE 10TH MARCH

AS SOON AS OUR GUNS WERE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE LE
TRANSLOYLOUPART LINE ITSELF WHICH THEY DID THE DAY AFTER THE
ENEMY LEISURELY AS ALWAYS RELEASED IT AND FELL BACK ON AND THROUGH
HIS NEXT LINE A MILE OR TWO BEHINDROCQUIGNYABLAINZEVELLESTEADIED
HIS REARGUARDS AND CONTINUED HIS PROGRESS TOWARDS THE HINDENBURG
DEFENCES WITHDRAWING ALONG THE WHOLE FRONT FROM SOUTH OF ARRAS TO
ROYE BY THE 17TH OF MARCH WORD WAS GIVEN FOR A GENERAL ADVANCE OF
OUR TROOPS IN COOPERATION WITH THE FRENCH

TO GO BACK A MONTH RUMOURS OF WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED HAD CHEERED
THE CAMPS FOR SOME TIME PAST AND JUST AS THE FALL OF SINGLE
ROCKS PRECEDES THE COLLAPSE OF AN UNDERMINED QUARRYFACE SO THE
GERMAN LINE HAD CRUMPLED IN CERTAIN SPOTS LONG BEFORE THEIR SYSTEM
READJUSTED ITSELF THROUGHOUT FRONTTRENCHES FAR REMOVED FROM
ACTUAL POINTS OF PRESSURE OBSERVED THAT LIFE WITH THEM WAS QUIETER
THAN EVEN THE STATE OF THE WEATHER JUSTIFIED AND BEGAN TO MAKE
INVESTIGATIONS

WHEN THE BATTALION WENT UP AS USUAL ON THE 15TH FEBRUARY TO RELIEVE
THE 2ND GRENADIERS IN THE TRENCHES A LITTLE NORTH OF RANCOURT AND
OPPOSITE ST PIERRE VAAST WOOD THEIR CASUALTIES FOR THE FOUR DAYS
WERE BUT THREE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED PRACTICALLY NO SNIPING AND
VERY OCCASIONAL SHELLING THEY TREATED IT LIGHTLY ENOUGH FOR IT WAS
HERE THAT THE SENTRY TOLD THE CONSCIENTIOUS OFFICER WHO HAD HEARD A
SHELL DROP NEAR THE TRENCH AH IT FELL QUITE CONVENIENT HEREA
JERK OF HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER AND AS AN AFTERTHOUGHTTWAS A
DUD THOUGH THE GROUND WAS STILL HARD AND TO THE MENS JOY THEY
COULD NOT DIG

CAPTAIN R J P RODAKOWSKI ARRIVED FROM THE BASE ON THE 18TH OF THE
MONTH THE THAW CAUGHT THEM IN CAMP AT MAUREPAS JUST AS THE ENEMYS
WITHDRAWAL GOT UNDER WAY AND THEIR TURN IN TRENCHES FROM THE 23RD TO
26TH FEBRUARY WAS MARKED BY BARRAGES LET DOWN ON THEM OF EVENINGS
PRESUMABLY TO DISCOURAGE CURIOSITY SO THEY WERE ORDERED AT SHORT
NOTICE TO SEND OUT A COUPLE OF OFFICERS PATROLS FROM THEIR LEFT
AND RIGHT COMPANIES TO RECONNOITRE GENERALLY AND SEE IF THE ENEMY
WERE FALLING BACK THE FIRST PATROL UNDER 2ND LIEUTENANT SHEARS AN
NCO THREE BOMBERS AND THREE BAYONETMEN SPENT A COUPLE OF
HOURS AMONG THE WIRE WERE BOMBED BUT RETURNED UNHURT THE SECOND
ALSO OF SEVEN MEN UNDER LIEUTENANT BROWNE WERE SEEN BY THE ENEMY
HEADED BACK TO OUR LINES BUT MADE A FRESH OUTFALL WHICH CARRIED
THEM TO THE WIRE WHERE FINDING A WEAK SPOT THEY CUT THEIR WAY
THROUGH IT AND WON WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THE ENEMYS PARAPET WHEN
THEY WERE BOMBED THEY USED UP THEIR OWN SUPPLIES AND CAME BACK WITH
A GOOD REPORT AND FOUR MEN AND LIEUTENANT BROWNE WOUNDED ON THEIR
INFORMATION A RAID WAS ARRANGED FOR THE NEXT DAY TO TAKE OVER A
COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS OF THE ENEMYS TRENCH BUT IT WAS CANCELLED
PENDING DEVELOPMENTS ELSEWHERE THEY LOST TWO KILLED AND THIRTEEN
MEN AND ONE OFFICER WOUNDED IN THIS TOUR AND WENT BACK TO ROUTINE
AND SPECIALIST TRAINING IN A CAMP NEAR BILLON ON THE LAST DAY OF
FEBRUARY

THEIR DOMESTIC ITEMS FOR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT WHICH LIKE THE REST
OF MARCH WAS COLD AND STORMY RUN AS FOLLOWS 2ND LIEUTENANT A L
BAIN WENT TO THE FOURTEENTH CORPS SCHOOL FOR A FORTNIGHT AT MAULTE
WHICH IN THAT WEATHER WAS NO SPECIAL TREAT AND LIEUTENANT E
H SHEARS TO HEADQUARTERS LEWIS GUN SCHOOL AT LE TOUQUET A MUCH
SUPERIOR PLACE LIEUTCOLONEL R C A MCCALMONT LEFT ON THE 3RD
MARCH TO TAKE OVER COMMAND OF THE 3RD INFANTRY BRIGADE JUST SOUTH OF
THE SOMME AND HAD A TREMENDOUS SENDOFF FROM THE BATTALION HE WAS
SUCCEEDED IN THE COMMAND BY MAJOR THE HON H R ALEXANDER DSO
MC AND MAJOR G E S YOUNG CAME OVER FROM THE 2ND BATTALION
AS SECOND IN COMMANDAS IT PROVED FOR ALL TOO BRIEF A TIME THE
SPECIALIST TRAINING CONTINUED AND OPEN WARFARE WAS PRACTISED
BY COMPANIES THERE WAS AN IRREVERENT CAMPJEST JUST THEN THAT
WHENEVER THE ENEMY ABANDONED ONE QUARTER OF A MILE OF TRENCH THE
FIVE NEAREST BRITISH ARMY CORPS FORSOOK EVERY OTHER GAME TO PRACTISE
OPEN WARFARE THE BATTALION LEARNED ALSO ATTACKS ON TRIPLE LINES OF
TRENCHES THE CREEPING BARRAGE BEING PERSONIFIED BY THEIR DRUMS AND
THOSE OF THE 2ND COLDSTREAM IN THIS SORT OF WORK MEN SAY THERE IS
A TENDENCY TO LEAN A LITTLE TOO HEAVILY ON SUCH A BARRAGE WHICH HAD
TO BE CHECKED BY TAKING THE OFFENDERS NAME SO YELL UNDERSTAND
YE CATCH IT BOTH WAYS FOR IF YE PURSHUE THE LIVE BARRAGE YELL
LIKELY TO BE KILLED AN IF YOU PURSHUE A DHRUMMY BARRAGE TOO CLOSE
YOUR NAMES IN THE BOOK THATS WAR


THE SOMME ADVANCE

BY THE MIDDLE OF MARCH THE GERMAN LINE WAS GIVING ALL ALONG AND
WHEN THE BATTALION MOVED UP INTO BRIGADE RESERVE ON THE 12TH THEY
UNDERSTOOD AN ADVANCE WAS CLOSE AT HAND THEIR ALLOTTED AND SKETCHY
STRETCH OF TRENCH WHICH THEY TOOK OVER FROM THE 4TH GRENADIERS ON
THE 13TH MARCH WAS AT SAILLYSAILLISEL OF EVIL ASSOCIATIONS
AND ON THE 14TH ON INFORMATION RECEIVED AFTER PATROLLING UNDER
LIEUTENANT E BUDD AND LIEUTENANT BAGENAL THE GERMAN FRONT LINE
AHEAD WAS REPORTED CLEAR AND AT ONCE OCCUPIED THEN THEY WERE
COMMITTED TO A MUDDLE OF GERMAN WORKS IN THE DIRECTION OF LE
MESNILENARROUAISE WHICH WERE NAMED AFTER THE IDOLS OF THE TRIBES
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE OR TO STEER BY EXCEPT DEVASTATED EARTH
MUD WIRE SCRAPS OF SANDBAGS HEAPED RUBBISH AND CARCASES THE
WHOLE LINE WENT FORWARD ON THE 15TH THE 1ST BATTALION IRISH GUARDS
IN TOUCH BY PATROL WITH THEIR 2ND BATTALION ON THEIR RIGHT AND ON
THE LEFT WITH THE 2ND COLDSTREAM NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN
THE ENEMYS MIND OR HOW FAR HIS RETIREMENT WAS EXTENDING BUT AN
HOUR AFTER THE BATTALION HAD STARTED THEY CAME UNDER LONGRANGE
MACHINEGUN AND HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE WHILE THEY WERE CONSOLIDATING
BAYREUTH TRENCH MAJOR G E S YOUNG WAS SO BADLY WOUNDED THIS
DAY BY A SHELL WHICH CAME THROUGH A COMPANY HEADQUARTERS DUGOUT
HE WAS VISITING THAT HE DIED IN A HOSPITAL A FORTNIGHT LATER AND
WAS BURIED AT GROVETOWN CEMETERY AND LIEUTENANT WALTER MUMFORD
MC WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED IN THE LEG THE NEXT TRENCH GOTHA
WAS ALSO UNDER GUNFIRE THEY SIMPLY MOVED FORWARD IT SEEMED INTO
REGISTERED AREAS WHERE THEY WERE HELD UP AS BY A HOSE OF HIGH
EXPLOSIVES TILL THE ENEMY HAD COMPLETED HIS LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS
THEN HIS ARTILLERY ON THAT SECTOR WOULD WITHDRAW ACROSS CLEAN HARD
COUNTRY SOME LONGRANGE MACHINEGUN OR SNIPING WORK MIGHT CONTINUE
FOR A WHILE AND THEN ALL WOULD BE SILENT WITH THE SUDDEN CURIOUS
SILENCES OF THE SOMME TILL THE NEXT STEP FORWARD WAS MADE ON OUR
SIDE AND DEALT WITH AS ABOVE THUS THE BATTALION WORKED THROUGH THE
EMPTIED GERMAN TRENCHES AND DUGOUTS AND ON THE 20TH MARCH HELD
A LINE FROM LE MESNILENARROUAISE TO MANANCOURT ON THE TORTILLE
RIVER THE GERMAN RETREAT WAS AS ORDERLY AS AN EBBTIDE IN THE
NORTH BAPAUME HAD BEEN TAKEN ON THE 17TH MARCH BY THE FIRST AND
SECOND AUSTRALIAN DIVISION AND PRONNE WAS OCCUPIED ON THE 18TH BY
THE FORTYEIGHTH DIVISION BEYOND BAPAUME OUR TROOPS ENTERED THE
THIRD AND LASTBEUGNYYTRESLINE OF GERMAN TRENCH AND WIREWORK
THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE HINDENBURG DEFENCES FOUR OR FIVE MILES
BEHIND IT ACROSS OPEN COUNTRY FROM PRONNE SOUTHWARD TO CLOSE UPON
GERMAINE WHERE WE WERE IN TOUCH WITH THE FRENCH OUR ADVANCEPARTIES
HAD CROSSED THE SOMME AND SPREAD THEMSELVES AS FAR AS THE STATE OF
THE GROUND ALLOWED INIT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED PURSUIT SO MUCH AS
A HEAVYFOOTED FOLLOWINGUP OF THE ENEMY AND MAKING OUR OWN ROADS
AND TRACKS AS WE MOVED WE FOUND EVERYTHING USABLE THOUGHTFULLY
DESTROYED AND HAD TO RECONSTRUCT IT FROM THE BEGINNINGS ERE ANY
FURTHER PRESSURE COULD BE EXERCISED

THE GERMAN FRONT BEFORE ARRAS WAS UNAFFECTED BY THEIR WITHDRAWAL
AND HERE PREPARATIONS OF EVERY CONCEIVABLE SORT WERE BEING PILED UP
AGAINST THE APPROACHING BATTLE OF THE ANCRE WHERE FROM CROISILLES
TO VIMY RIDGE OUR THIRD AND FIRST ARMIES BROKE THROUGH ON A FRONT
OF FIFTEEN MILES ON APRIL 9 AND AFTER A WEEKS DESPERATE FIGHTING
HAMPERED AS USUAL BY THE WEATHER CARRIED THAT FRONT FOUR MILES
FARTHER EASTWARD CAPTURED 13000 PRISONERS AND 200 GUNS AND
THROUGH THE NEXT MONTH FOUGHT THEIR ROAD UP AND INTO THE NORTHERN
END OF THE HINDENBURG LINE NEAR BULLECOURT WHOSE NAME BELONGS TO
AUSTRALIA

ON THE 23RD OF MARCH THE BATTALION WAS TAKEN OUT OF ITS
UNMOLESTED GERMAN TRENCHES AND MARCHED TO COMBLES WHERE IT WAS
USED IN ROADMAKING BETWEEN FRGICOURT BULLET CROSSROADS AND
SAILLYSAILLISEL TILL THE 5TH OF APRIL THERE WAS JUST ONE DAY
IN THAT STRETCH WITHOUT RAIN HAIL OR SNOW AND WHEN THEY WERE
NOT ROADMAKING THEY BURIED DEAD AND COLLECTED SALVAGE AND WERE
COMPLIMENTED BY THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF ENGINEERS ON THEIR GOOD
WORK AS THE MEN SAID IT WAS GREAT DAYS FOR THE ENGINEERSBAD LUCK
TO EMBUT IT KEPT US WARM

THEIR TOTAL LOSSES FOR MARCH HAD BEEN ONE OFFICER MAJOR G E S
YOUNG KILLED AND ONE LIEUTENANT WALTER MUMFORD MC SLIGHTLY
WOUNDED FOURTEEN OTHER RANKS KILLED AND FORTY WOUNDEDFIFTYSIX
IN ALL OR LESS THAN 10 PER CENT OF THE BATTALIONS STRENGTH AT THE
TIME SECOND LIEUTENANT H V FANSHAWE JOINED ON THE 30TH MARCH

ON THE 6TH APRIL THEY CHANGED OVER TO RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION ON THE
BROADGAUGE TRACK BETWEEN MORVAL AND ROCQUIGNY THE MEN CAMPED AT
ONE END OF LE TRANSLOY VILLAGE AND BATTALION HEADQUARTERS IN THE
ONLY HOUSE MUCH DAMAGED THAT STILL STOOD UP HERE THEY STAYED AND
SLAVED FOR A WEEK IN HAIL AND SNOW AND HEAVY FROSTS AT NIGHT AND
WERE PRACTICALLY RECLOTHED AS THEIR UNIFORMS WERE NOT IN THE BEST
OF CONDITION YE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD US FROMFROM ANYTHING OR
ANYBODY YE WERE LIKELY TO MEET IN THOSE PARTS YELL UNDERSTAND
BUTONE COMFORTWE WAS ALL ALIKEOFFICERS AN ALL A VILLAGE
THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOO TOTALLY WRECKED IS A CONVENIENT DUMP TO DRAW
UP THE MEN IMPROVED THEIR CAMP AND FLOORED THEIR TENTS OUT OF
MATERIAL AT HAND AND WERE REWARDED BY FINDING USABLE GERMAN STORES
AMONG THE RUINS ONE SEES HOW THEIR MORALE HELD UP IN SPITE OF
DIRT IRONRUST AND FOUL WEATHER FROM THE FACT THAT THEY WENT
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO CONSTRUCTEVEN AS THEY HAD DONE AT YPRESA
MAGNIFICENT IRISH GUARDS STAR OF GLASS AND STONES ALL SURROUNDED BY
A LOW BOXHEDGE NOR WAS IT FORGOTTEN THAT THEY WERE SOLDIERS AND
IN SPITE OF THE RAILWAYWORK AND THE DEMANDS OF THE SAPPERS SOME
OF THE SPECIALISTS AND OCCASIONALLY A COMPANY COULD BE TRAINED AT
LE TRANSLOY EVEN TRAINING IS PREFERABLE TO FATIGUES AND ON THE
15TH OF APRIL THEY WERE TAKEN IN HAND IN GOOD EARNEST THEY MARCHED
TWELVE MILES IN POURING RAIN TO A CAMP AT BRONFAY WHERE A VERY
STRICT COURSE OF PLATOON TRAINING FOR ALL RANKS WAS UNDERTAKEN IT
BEGAN WITH TWENTY MINUTES WALKING OR RUNNING IN THE USUAL RAIN OR
SNOW BEFORE BREAKFAST AT 730 AND IT CONTINUED WITH A HALFHOURS
BREAK TILL HALFPAST TWELVE EVEN AFTER THREE DAYS THERE WAS AN
APPRECIABLE IMPROVEMENT IN DRILL AND SMARTNESS SAYS THE DIARY AND
WHEN THEIR BRIGADIER INSPECTED THEM ON THE 22ND APRIL HE WAS PLEASED
TO COMPLIMENT OF AFTERNOONS EVERY ONE SEEMED TO LECTURE TO EVERY
ONE ELSE ACCORDING TO THEIR SENIORITY THE BRIGADIER ON OUTPOSTS
THE COMMANDING OFFICERMAJOR R BAGGALLAYON ADVANCE AND REAR
GUARDS THE OFFICERS TO THE PLATOONSERGEANTS ON EVERY DETAIL OF
LIFESAVING OR TAKING AND WHEN THEIR OWN RESOURCES FAILED THE CO
OF THE 2ND COLDSTREAM LECTURED ALL OFFICERS AND SERGEANTS OF THE
1ST BRIGADE ON THE ATTACK IN OPEN WARFARE IT WAS A VERY THOROUGH
SHAKINGUPFOOT AND TRANSPORTFROM THE SPECIALISTS TO THE COOKS
MATE AND IT CULMINATED IN NO 5 PLATOON LIEUTENANT E BUDD BEING
CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE BATTALION AT THE BRIGADE PLATOON COMPETITION
IN DRILL ARMS DRILL MUSKETRY BAYONETFIGHTING AND A TACTICAL
EXERCISE THE 2ND GRENADIERS PLATOON WON BUT NO 5 JUSTIFIED ITSELF
BY TAKING A VERY CLOSE SECOND PLACE SURVIVORS WHO REMEMBER ASSERT
THAT THE PLATOONS OF THOSE DAYS WERE IN KNOWLEDGE STRENGTH AND
VIRTUE IMMEASURABLY ABOVE ALL KNOWN STANDARDS OF FIGHTING MEN AND
IN THE LONG RUN DYE SEE THEY WENT WITH THE REST ALL GONE MAYBE
THERELL BE ONE OR TWO OF EM LEFTPOLICEMEN OR TRAMCONDUCTORS AN
SUCH LIKE BUT IN THEIR DAY AN TIME YELL UNDERSTAND THERE WAS
NOTHING COULD EQUAL THEM

THE LIGHTER SIDE OF LIFE WAS SUPPLIED BY THE 3RD COLDSTREAMS
HISTORIC AND UNPARALLELED PANTOMIME WHICH RAN ITS RIBALD AND
IMMENSELY CLEVER COURSE FOR TEN CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS WHEN THE CARS OF
THE STAFF MIGHT BE SEEN PARKED OUTSIDE THE THEATRE PRECISELY AS IN
THE WEST END

ON THE 1ST MAY THEY RESUMED WORK ON THE ETRICOURTFINS RAILROAD AND
MADE CAMP AMONG THE RUINS OF THE VILLAGE FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS
IN FINE HOT WEATHER THE OFFICERS AND NCOS WERE EXERCISED
FREELY AT MAPREADING WHICH ON THE SOMME REQUIRED HIGH POWERS OF
IMAGINATION SKETCHING REPORTS AND COMPASSWORK AND OCCASIONALLY
OFFICERS AND NCOS MADE UP A PLATOON AND WORKED OUT SMALL TACTICAL
EXERCISESSUCH AS THE RUSHIN AND DOWNING OF A SUDDENLY RAISED
MACHINEGUN AFTER A BARRAGE HAD LIFTED THE MEN WERE KEPT TO THE
NEEDS OF RAILWAY AND TRANSPORT BUT IT WAS AN EASY LIFE IN WARM
GRASSY ETRICOURT AFTER MONTHS OF MUD AND TORN DIRT A SWIMMING BATH
WAS DUG FOR THEM THERE WERE WILD FLOWERS TO BE GATHERED AND AN
ORCHARD IN BLOSSOM TO SHOW THAT THE WORLD STILL LIVED NATURALLY
AND THEIR WORK WAS CLOSE TO THEIR PARADEGROUNDS MEN SPOKE
AFFECTIONATELY OF ETRICOURT WHERE SHELLHOLES WERE SO FEW THAT THEY
COULD COUNT THEM

A HOMEDRAFT HAD BROUGHT THE BATTALION SIX PIPERS WHO ON THE 4TH OF
MAY PLAYED AT RETREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEREAFTER FOLLOWED
THE BATTALIONS FORTUNES AS EVERYBODY KNOWS IRISH PIPES HAVE ONE
DRONE LESS THAN THE SCOTTISH BUT IT IS NOT COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD THAT
THE PIPER IN HIS CLOSEFITTING SAFFRON KILT PLAYS THEM ALMOST WITHOUT
ANY MOVEMENT OF THE BODYA POINT OF DIFFERENCE THAT HAS PUZZLED VERY
MANY SCOTS REGIMENTS THAT IMMOBILITY AS THE PIPE MAJOR OBSERVED ON
AN HISTORIC OCCASION IS ONE OF THE SECRETS OF THE REGIMENT

ON THE 20TH OF MAY THEY MARCHEDNOT WITHOUT SOME DISCOMFORT FROM AN
ARTILLERY BRIGADE WHICH WAS TRYING TO USE THE SAME ROAD AT THE SAME
TIMEFROM ETRICOURT TO CURLU ON THE SOMME WHERE THEY WERE ONCE
MORE BILLETED IN HOUSES HERE AFTER SO MANY WEEKS OF MAKING THEIR
OWN CAMPS TO THEIR OWN MINDS THEY WERE INTRODUCED TO OTHER PEOPLES
HOUSEKEEPING AND FOUND THE WHOLE VILLAGE LEFT IN A FILTHY CONDITION
BY PREVIOUS TROOPS SO THEY CLEANED IT UP AND TRAINED AND LEARNED
FROM THE DIVISIONAL GAS OFFICER OF TRANSPORT HOW GASHELMETS SHOULD
BE ADJUSTED ON HORSESTO WHICH SOME OF THE SCARED BEASTS HOTLY
OBJECTED AND THEY BATHED BY COMPANIES IN THE WARM SOMME MAKING
A PICNIC OF IT WHILE THE LONGDRAWN BATTLE OF THE ANCRE IN THE
NORTH DIED DOWN TO MERE BLOODY DAYANDNIGHT WAR AMONG THE VILLAGES
COVERING THE HINDENBURG LINE AND ITS SPURS THE TALK IN THE CAMPS
TURNED ON GREAT DOINGSEVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THE FRONTLINE
WAS DOINGSAGAINST MESSINES RIDGE THAT LOOKS OVER THE FLAT
SHELLBITTEN SALIENT WHERE THERE IS MORE COMPULSORY TRENCHBATHING
THAN ANY MAN WANTS IT HAD COMMANDED TOO MUCH OF THAT COUNTRY FOR
TOO LONG AT ITS HIGHEST POINT WHERE WYTSCHAETE VILLAGE HAD ONCE
STOOD IT OVERLOOKED YPRES AND THE BRITISH POSITIONS AROUND AND WAS
A MENACE OVER DESOLATE PLUGSTREET FAR TOWARDS ARMENTIRES RUMOUR
RAN THAT ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SHIFT IT BODILY OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH THAT POPULATIONS OF MINERS HAD BURROWED THERE THROUGH
MONTHS FOR MILES THAT ALL UNDERGROUND WAS RIDDLED WITH WORKINGS
WHERE MEN FOUGHT IN THE DARK UP AND DOWN TUNNELS THAT CAVED ROUND
THE SHARP TURNS OF BOARDED AND BAGGED GALLERIES AND ON THE LIPS OF
BLACK SHAFTS THAT DROPPED ONE INTO FORTYFOOT GRAVES YET EVEN WERE
MESSINES RIDGE WIPED OUT THE ENEMY HAD LARGE CHOICES OF COMMANDING
POSITIONS PRACTICALLY ALL ROUND THE SALIENT AND IT SEEMED LIKELY
BY WHAT NEWS SIFTED INTO THEIR AREA THAT THE GUARDS MIGHT BE CALLED
UPON BEFORE LONG TO HELP IN FURTHER BIG DOINGS YPRES WAYPERHAPS A
BREAKTHROUGH TOWARDS LILLE


THE SALIENT AND BOESINGHE

THE SALIENT HAD BEEN THE RUNNING SORE IN OUR ARMIES SIDE SINCE THE
FIRST NOW THAT WE HAD MEN GUNS AND MATERIAL IT LOOKED AS IF IT
MIGHT BE STAUNCHED AT LAST A BATTALION DOES NOT THINK BEYOND ITS
IMMEDIATE INTERESTSEVEN OFFICERS ARE DISCOURAGED FROM TRYING TO RUN
THE WAR BY THEMSELVESBUT IT DID NOT NEED TO BE TOLD THAT IT HAD NOT
BEEN FATTENED UP THE LAST FEW WEEKS FOR HEADQUARTERS PLEASURE IN ITS
APPEARANCE MEN KNOW WHEN THEY ARE FOR IT AND IF THEY FORGET ARE
REMINDED FROM THE DOORS OF CROWDED ESTAMINETS AND CANTEENS OR FROM
THE TAILBOARDS OF LOADED LORRIES AS THEIR COMRADES FLEET BY IN THE
DUSK THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED WHEN ORDERS CAME FOR A SHIFT

ON THE EVENING OF THE 30TH MAY THEY WERE TAKEN BY TRAIN FROM THEIR
CAMP VIA AMIENS ABBEVILLE AND BOULOGNE AND ST OMER TO CASSEL
IN THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN HOURS AND FROM CASSEL MARCHED BACK ALONG
THE WELLKNOWN PAV NEARLY TO ST OMER AGAIN AND BILLETED BETWEEN LA
CROSSE AND THE DINGY WIDE RAILWAYCROSSING AT FORT ROUGE ALL THE
COUNTRY ROUND WAS BUSY RAISING CROPS EVERY OLD MAN WOMAN AND CHILD
WORKING AS LONG AS LIGHT LASTED THEIR ONLY AVAILABLE TRAININGGROUND
WAS THE FOREST OF CLAIRMARAIS WITH ITS TWO CHARACTERISTIC WOODED
HILLS THAT STAND UP BEHIND ST OMER HERE THEY WERE TAUGHT
WOODFIGHTING IN ADDITION TO OTHER SPECIALTIES AND THE MESS
FOUND TIME TO GIVE A DINNER OF HONOUR TO A FRIENDLY FIELDAMBULANCE
IRISH IN THE MAIN TO WHOM THEY HAD ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS OWED
MUCH SCANDAL ASSERTS THAT THE GUESTS DEPARTED IN THE DAWN ON
THEIR OWN STRETCHERS HERE TOO ON THE 6TH JUNE THEY ENTERED FOR
THE BRIGADE HORSESHOW AND WON FIRST PRIZE FOR THE BEST TURNED OUT
LIMBERANDPAIR AND SECONDS FOR WATERCART AND COOKERANDPAIRNO
SMALL THING WHEN ONE CONSIDERS WHAT IS THE STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE IN
BRIGADE TRANSPORT

ON THE NEXT DAY JUNE 7 THE NINETEEN MINES OF MESSINES WENT UP
TOGETHER IN THE DAWN THE THREE ARMY CORPS SECOND ANZAC AND NINTH
AND TENTH CORPS LOOSED BEHIND THEM BROKE FORWARD OVER MESSINES AND
WYTSCHAETE AND THE WHOLE GERMAN LINE FROM ARMAGH WOOD TO PLUGSTREET
WAS WRENCHED BACKWARDS FROM A MILE TO TWO MILES ALL ALONG MESSINES
WAS A SINGULARLY COMPLETE AND SATISFACTORY AFFAIR INCLUDING SOME
SEVEN THOUSAND PRISONERS AND BETTER STILL A MULTITUDE OF DEAD
KILLED OFF IN COUNTERATTACKS IT OPENED THE ROAD FOR THE THIRD
BATTLE OF YPRES WHICH WAS TO WIN MORE BREATHINGSPACE ROUND THE WRECK
OF THE CITY UNLIKE ARRAS WHERE THERE WAS ALMOST UNLIMITED SPACE
FOR ASSEMBLY IN SUBTERRANEAN CAVES AND CELLARS EVERY PREPARATION
IN THE SALIENT HAD TO BE CARRIED OUT UNDER THE ENEMYS EYES ON
KNOWN AND REGISTERED GROUND LACKING SHELTER ABOVE OR BELOW THUS
THE ATTACK WHICH WAS TO COVER A FRONT OF FIFTEEN MILES DEMANDED
AS MUCH EFFORT AND PREARRANGEMENT AS ANY OPERATION THAT HAD TILL
THEN BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE WAR THOSE WERE MADE
AND CARRIED THROUGH AMONG AND IN SPITE OF THE DAILY DEMANDS OF
CONTINUOUS LOCAL OPERATIONS WITH THE SAME THOROUGHNESS AND FIXEDNESS
OF PURPOSE AS WHEN THE BRIGADE COMPETED FOR ITS LITTLE PRIZES AND
TROPHIES AT RENESCURE HORSESHOW

ON THE 12TH JUNE THE BATTALION MARCHED THIRTEEN MILES FOR MUSKETRY TO
MORINGHEM IN THE BARE HIGH DOWNCOUNTRY BEHIND ACQUIN WHERE TWO MEN
COLLAPSED WITH HEATSTROKE A CENTURY AGO THE DRILLBOOK LAID DOWN
THAT UNAIMED BATTALIONFIRE FROM BROWN BESS SHOULD NEVER BE OPENED
AT OVER FOUR HUNDRED YARDS THEY PRACTISED SLOW AND RAPID FIRING WITH
FIXED BAYONETS AT TWO AND THREE HUNDRED COMPANY SHARPSHOOTERS USING
FIGURES AT THE SAME RANGE

ON THE 16TH JUNE THE FIRST DRAWING IN TOWARDS THE SALIENT BEGAN
THEY CAMPED THAT NIGHT AT OUDERZEELE NORTH OF CASSEL AFTER SUCH
HEAT AS MADE SEVERAL OF THE MEN FALL OUT BY THE WAY AND ON THE 17TH
BIVOUACKED IN SHEDS AND SHELTERS IN THE WOODS SOUTHEAST OF PROVEN
ON THE POPERINGHE ROAD WHERE THE CULTIVATION ALL UNAFFECTED BY THE
WAR HALF A DOZEN MILES OFF WAS AS THICK AS EVER AND EXCEPT FOR
SPECIALIST TRAINING IN THE WOODS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND THE MEN
WORK THE MEN BORE THIS QUITE CALMLY

AS A SIGN OF THE TIMES LIEUTENANT H HICKIE WHO HAD BEEN ON LEAVE
ARRIVED AND AGAIN TOOK OVER HIS DUTIES AS QUARTERMASTER ON THE
20TH JUNE LIEUTENANT J H NASH LEFT ON THE SAME DATE FOR THE ARMY
CENTRAL SCHOOL AND ON THE 22ND CAPTAIN R RODAKOWSKI AND LIEUTENANT
W JOYCE WERE DETAILED FOR COURSES OF INSTRUCTION AT LE TOUQUET LEWIS
GUN SCHOOL

ON THE 23RD JUNE MAJORGENERAL SIR A J GODLEY COMMANDING THE
SECOND ANZAC CORPS CAME OVER ON A VISIT TO THE BATTALION AND
INSPECTED THE MEN AND DAY BY DAY THE PIECES REQUIRED FOR THE NEXT
MOVE ON THE CHESSBOARD OF WAR WERE PUSHED INTO THEIR PLACES ALONG
THE SALIENT THE FIFTH ARMYOF FOUR CORPS AND SOME DIVISIONSUNDER
GENERAL GOUGH WAS TO TAKE THE WEIGHT OF THE AFFAIR BETWEEN KLEIN
ZILLEBEEKE AND BOESINGHE WHILE THE FIRST FRENCH ARMYFIRST AND
FIFTYFIRST DIVISIONSWOULD RELIEVE THE BELGIANS FROM BOESINGHE TO
NOORDSCHOOTE AND EXTEND THE LINE ALONG THE YSER CANAL NORTH OF YPRES
TO STEENSTRAATE THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS TO LIE NEXT THEM ON THE
EXTREME LEFT OF OUR LINE AT BOESINGHE

ON THE 25TH JUNE THE BATTALION MOVED FROM PROVEN INTO THE EDGE
OF THE BATTLEAREA NEAR WOESTEN A COUPLE OF MILES OR SO BEHIND
BOESINGHE ITSELF AND CAME UNDER THE FIRE OF A LONGRANGE GERMAN
NAVAL GUN WHICH MERELY CUT UP THE FIELDS ROUND THEM BOTH SIDES WERE
NOW HARD AT WORK IN THE AIR TRYING TO PUT OUT EACH OTHERS EYES
AND A GERMAN AEROPLANE BROUGHT DOWN ONE OF OUR OBSERVATIONBALLOONS
HIDEOUSLY ALIGHT CLOSE TO WOESTEN CAMP ALL THE SALIENT HUMMED
WITH OPPOSING AIRCRAFT THE BOMBING OF BACKAREAS WAS CRUEL AND
CONTINUOUS AND MEN HAD NO REST FROM STRAIN BUT OUR BATTERIES
PROFITING BY THE HELP OF OUR MACHINES HAMMERED THE ENEMY LINE AS
IT HAD NOT BEEN HAMMERED THERE SINCE WAR BEGAN OILDRUMS GAS AND
THERMITE SHELLS WERE ADDED TO THE REGULAR ALLOWANCES SENT OVER AND
WHENEVER CHANCE OFFERED RAIDINGPARTIES DOVE IN AND OUT OF THE FRONT
LINES SHARKING PRISONERS FOR IDENTIFICATION THE BATTALIONS SHARE
IN THIS WORK WAS THE USUAL FATIGUEUNLOADING TRUCKS AND THE LIKE
BENEATH INTERMITTENT ARTILLERYFIRE WHICH ON THE 29TH JUNE ENDED IN
THREE DIRECT HITS ON THE FARMHOUSE ROUSSEL FARM NEAR ELVERDINGHE
WHERE THEY LAY ONE MAN WAS KILLED OUTRIGHT AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED
THEIR REGULAR ROUTINEWORK OF DEATH HAD BEGUN AGAIN

ON THE 1ST OF JULY THEY WENT INTO LINE ON THE BOESINGHE SECTOR
RELIEVING THE 2ND COLDSTREAM ON THE WEST OR NEAR SECTOR OF THE YSER
CANAL THEIR TRENCHES WERE OF THE USUAL BUILTUP SANDBAGGED TYPE
HEADQUARTERS WERE AT BLEUET FARM WELL UNDER FIRE OF ALL KINDS
AND THOUGH THEY MANAGED THEIR RELIEF AT NIGHT WITH LITTLE SHELLING
EARLY NEXT MORNING LIEUTENANT E SHEARS WAS KILLED BY SHELL IT
WAS A BAD SECTOR IN EVERY WAY FOR NOT ONLY DID THE BATTALION LINK
ON HERE TO THE BELGIAN ARMYLATER RELIEVED BY THE FRENCHON THEIR
LEFT AND ANY POINT OF JUNCTION OF ALLIED FORCES IS ALWAYS SEVERELY
DEALT WITH BUT THE ENEMY WERE KEPT IN TENSION BY CONSTANT RAIDS
OR THE FEAR OF THEM ALL ALONG THE LINE THIS MEANT THAT THEIR SOS
SIGNALS WENT UP ON THE LEAST PROVOCATION AND THEIR BARRAGES FOLLOWED
WITH NERVOUS PUNCTUALITY ADDED TO THIS FATIGUEWORK WAS VERY HEAVY
NOT ONLY IN REPAIRS BUT IN SUPPLY AND THE NECESSARY EXPOSURE OF THE
CARRYINGPARTIES LED TO CONSTANT CASUALTIES

ON THE 5TH JULY FOR INSTANCE AT TWO IN THE MORNING GAS SHELLS
FIRED FROM PROJECTORS THE GERMANS WERE SEARCHING THE LINE IN EARNEST
THAT NIGHT FELL ON A WORKINGPARTY OF NO 4 COMPANY NINETEEN MEN
WERE AT ONCE PROSTRATED OF WHOM ONE DIED THEN AND THERE AND TWO A
FEW DAYS LATER WHILE LIEUTENANT BAGENAL WAS SLIGHTLY AFFECTED IT
IS DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY IN THE DARK TO KEEP WORKINGPARTIES WHO
HAVE TO WORK AGAINST TIME INSIDE THEIR GASMASKS THEY WERE SHELLED
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WITH NO FURTHER CASUALTIES

ON THE 6TH JULY MAJOR HON H R ALEXANDER LEAVING FOR ENGLAND TO
ATTEND THE OFFICERS COURSE AT ALDERSHOT CAPTAIN R R C BAGGALLAY
TOOK OVER THE COMMAND AND ON THE 8TH JULY THEY WERE RELIEVED BY
THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AND BIVOUACKED AT CARDOEN FARM WHERE THEY SPENT
TWO DAYS NOMINALLY RESTINGTHAT IS TO SAY SUPPLYING ONE HUNDRED
AND TEN MEN EACH NIGHT FOR THE DETESTABLE WORK OF CARRYINGPARTIES
TO THE FRONT LINE LIEUTCOLONEL ROCKE DSO COMMANDING SINCE
MAY 24 RETURNED FROM LEAVE ON JULY 8 BUT UNLUCKILY ON THE 11TH
WHEN THE BATTALION WAS IN LINE IN THE WRECK OF BOESINGHE VILLAGE
HEADQUARTERS AT BOESINGHE CHTEAU SLIPPED AND BROKE HIS SHOULDER
WHILE GOING ROUND THE TRENCHES AND CAPTAIN BAGGALLAY AGAIN TOOK
OVER COMMAND THERE WAS STEADY WELLRANGED SHELLING ALL THAT DAY
PARTICULARLY ON BOESINGHE CHTEAU IN THE REAR OF WHICH THE AIDPOST
AND HEADQUARTERS OF NO 1 COMPANY LAY BATTALION HEADQUARTERS WERE
SHELLED FOR HALF AN HOUR SEPARATELY NO 3 COMPANYS HEADQUARTERS
IN THE SUPPORTLINE WERE WRECKED BY DIRECT HITS AND THE ENTIRE
COMPANY SHELLED OUT WHILE THE WHOLE OF THE BACK LINES WERE WORKED
OVER UP AND DOWN ALL REPAIRS HAD TO BE BUILT UP WITH SANDBAGS FOR
THE GROUND WAS TOO MARSHY TO GIVE USEFUL DIRT AND THE LABOUR WAS
UNENDING

ON THE 12TH JULY THEY WERE SHELLED MORE HEAVILY THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO
DAYS ON EXACTLY THE SAME PLACES AND THEIR TRANSPORT WHICH TILL NOW
HAD HAD REASONABLE LUCK WAS CAUGHT FETCHING UP WATER AND RATIONS
THE FOUR COMPANY QUARTERMASTERSERGEANTS AND THE MESSSERGEANT WERE
WOUNDED A HORSE AND GROOM KILLED AND LATER ON THE TRANSPORT
OFFICER WAS SLIGHTLY GASSED TIS THE TRANSPORT YELL UNDERSTAND
THAT HAS TO TAKE ALL JERRYS BACKCHAT AFTER DHARK AN NO CHANCE OF
REPLYIN BY NIGHT THEY FOUND CARRYINGPARTIES TO FILL DUMPSFIVE
OF THEMEACH DUMP SEEMING TO THOSE SERVING IT MORE EXPOSED AND
UNDESIRABLE THAN THE OTHER FOUR PUT TOGETHER

ON THE 14TH OF JULY THERE WAS A GERMAN RAID PRECEDED BY AN HOURS
BOX BARRAGE OF TRENCHMORTARS 77S AND MACHINEGUNS ON TWO
PLATOONS OF NO 4 COMPANY THEN IN THE FRONT LINE BEHIND THE CANAL
A SHRAPNELBARRAGE FELL ALSO ON THE SUPPORTS A BOX BARRAGE IS A
SQUARE HORROR OF DESCENDING FIRE CUTTING OFF ALL HELP AND RANKS HIGH
AMONG DEMORALISING EXPERIENCES LUCKILY THE LINE WAS LIGHTLY HELD
AND THE MEN HAD MORE OR LESS OF COVER IN DUGOUTS AND TUNNELS IN THE
CANAL BANK A LEWISGUN POST IN A COVERED EMPLACEMENT ALMOST ON
THE BED OF THE CANAL ITSELF WAS FIRST AWARE THROUGH THE INFERNAL
RACKET OF GERMANS CROSSING THE CANAL AND FIRED AT THEM STRAIGHT
DOWN THE LINE OF ITS BED THEY BROKE AND DISAPPEARED IN THE RANK
WEEDGROWTH BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER RUSH OVER THE PARAPET OF THE LINE
BETWEEN TWO SENTRY GROUPS IN THE FIRINGBAYS THE TRENCHES WERE ALIVE
BY THEN WITH SCATTERED PARTIES STUMBLING THROUGH THE BLACK DARK
AND MISTAKING EACH OTHER FOR FRIENDS OR ENEMIES AND THE RUIN OF
THE WORKS ADDED TO THE CONFUSION AS FAR AS CAN BE MADE OUT ONE
OFFICER LIEUTENANT H J B EYRE COMING ALONG WHAT WAS LEFT OF A
TRENCH RAN LITERALLY INTO A PARTY OF THE ENEMY HIS STEEL HELMET AND
REVOLVER ALL CHAMBERS FIRED WERE FOUND AFTERWARDS NEAR THE WRECK OF
A FIRINGBAY BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER TRACE IT WAS LEARNED LATER THAT
HE HAD BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED AND DIED THAT EVENING IN TRENCHRAIDS
WHEN LIFE DEATH OR CAPTURE OFTEN TURN ON A STEP TO THE LEFT OR THE
RIGHT THE MARVEL WAS THAT SUCH ACCIDENTS WERE NOT MORE FREQUENT

A WOUNDED GERMAN WAS CAPTURED HE HAD NO MARKS OF IDENTIFICATION
BUT SAID HE BELONGED TO A SCHLESWIG REGIMENT AND THAT THE STRENGTH
OF THE RAID WAS INTENDED TO BE TWO HUNDRED IT DID NOT AS THE
MEN SAID FEEL ANYTHING LIKE SO MANY THOUGH THE WILD LIGHTS OF
EXPLOSION THAT LIT THE SCENE SHOWED LARGE ENEMY PARTIES WAITING
EITHER IN THE BED OF THE CANAL OR ON THE OPPOSITE BANK THESE TOO
VANISHED INTO THE DARK AFTER THEIR COMRADES IN THE TRENCHES HAD BEEN
TURNED OUT PROBABLY IT WAS BUT AN IDENTIFICATION FRAY BACKED BY A
FARREACHING ARTILLERY HATE THAT TROUBLED ALL THE BACKAREAS EVEN
UP TO ELVERDINGHE

OUR FRONTLINE CASUALTIES IN THE AFFAIR WERE BUT ONE OFFICER AND ONE
MAN MISSING AND ONE WOUNDED YET THE BARRAGE BLEW THE MEN ABOUT LIKE
WITHERED LEAVES COVERED THEM WITH MUD PLASTERED THEM WITH BITS OF
SANDBAGS AND GAPPED AS IT SEEMED FATHOMS OF TRENCH AT A STROKE
WHILE ENEMY MACHINEGUNS SCISSORED BACK AND FORTH OVER EACH GAP THE
COMPANIES IN THE SUPPORTLINE WHO WATCHED THE AFFAIR AND EXPECTED
VERY FEW TO COME OUT OF IT ALIVE SUFFERED MUCH MORE SEVERELY FROM
THE SHRAPNELBARRAGE WHICH FELL TO THEIR SHARE

IT WAS THEIR LAST TOUR IN THE TRENCHES FOR TEN DAYS AND IT CLOSED
WITH HEAVY BARRAGES ON THE FRONT AND BACK LINES WHILE THEY WERE
BEING RELIEVED BY THE 1ST COLDSTREAM THIS CONTINUED TILL OUR
GUNS WERE ASKED TO REPLY AND AFTER TEN MINUTES MADE THEM CEASE
THE BATTALION LEFT THE TRENCHES IN A STEADY DOWNPOUR OF WET AND
ENTRAINED FROM ELVERDINGHE FOR PROVEN WHENCE THEY MOVED INTO THE
TRAININGAREA AT HERZEELE WHERE A REPRESENTATION OF THE GROUND TO
BE ATTACKED ON THE DAY OF BATTLE WITH ITS TRENCHES AND FARMS WAS
MARKED OUT AND HAD TO BE STUDIED BY COMPANY COMMANDERS NCOS
AND MEN ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK AND RESPONSIBILITY THE OFFICERS
MESS AT HERZEELE WAS IN THE QUAINT OLD THREESTORIED TOWER BUILT
WHEN THE SPANIARDS HELD RULE IN THE LOW COUNTRIES

FROM THE 16TH TO THE 23RD JULY THEIR MORNINGS WERE SPENT AT EVERY
SORT OF DRILLSMOKEHELMET DRILL MUSKETRY WIRING LEWISGUN ETC
AND THEIR AFTERNOONS IN GOING OVER THE TRAININGGROUND AND PRACTISING
ATTACKS ALL THAT TIME THE WEATHER WAS PERFECT AS SOON AS THEY MOVED
AWAY TO PROVEN AND INTO THE BATTLEAREA ON JULY 25 HEAVY RAIN BEGAN
WHICH AS ON THE SOMME WHERE THE DEVIL DULY LOOKED AFTER HIS OWN
WAS DESTINED TO BAULK AND CRIPPLE THE BATTLE FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO
THEIR NEXT MONTHS WORK THE BATTALION ROUSED AT 2 A M ON THAT
DAY BY GASALARMS FROM THE FRONT PROVIDED OVER FIVE HUNDRED MEN FOR
WORKINGPARTIES TO GET STUFF INTO THE FRONT LINE LOST TEN MEN KILLED
BY SHELLFIRE AND ONE OFFICER LIEUTENANT H H MAXWELL WHO HAD COME
UNSCATHED THROUGH THE RAID OF THE 14TH AND SEVEN MEN WOUNDED AND
NEXT EVENING MOVED TO THEIR OWN PLACE A DISTANCE OF TWO AND A HALF
MILES WITH TWO HUNDRED YARD INTERVALS BETWEEN THE PLATOONS UNDER
CASUAL SHELLFIRE

THEY CAMPED JULY 27 IN SUPPORT NEAR BLEUET FARM AND THAT EVENING
HAD WORD THAT OUR AEROPLANES REPORTED NO GERMANS COULD BE SEEN IN
THE GERMAN FRONTLINE SYSTEM AND THAT THE 3RD COLDSTREAM HAD SENT
PATROLS FORWARD WHO WERE ALREADY ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE CANAL AS A
MATTER OF FACT THE ENEMY WAS HOLDING HIS FRONT LINE IN CHAINS OF
SINGLE POSTS PREFERRING RATHER TO FIGHT FOR IT THAN IN IT AND WAS
RELYING ON HIS CAREFULLY HIDDEN FERROCONCRETE BLOCKHOUSESLATER
KNOWN AS PILLBOXESWHICH AS HE HAD ARRANGED THEM IN THE TORN
AND MARSHY LANDSCAPE AND ALONG THE LINE OF THE YPRESSTADEN
RAIL COULD HOLD UP AND DISSIPATE ANY AVERAGE INFANTRY ATTACK
THEY WERE IMPERVIOUS TO ANYTHING EXCEPT DIRECT HITS OF BIG STUFF
THEIR WEAKNESS WAS THE SMALL SIZE OF THE SLIT THROUGH WHICH THEIR
MACHINEGUNS OPERATED AND A CERTAIN CLUMSINESS IN THE ARRANGEMENT
OF THE GUN ITSELF WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DEPRESS CONSEQUENTLY
COOL HEADS COULD CRAWL UP AND UNDER AND RUSH THE THING AT CLOSE
QUARTERS

WHETHER THE ENEMY BELIEVED THERE WOULD BE NO SERIOUS ATTACK AT THE
JUNCTION OF THE FRENCH AND BRITISH ARMS IN THE BOESINGHE SECTOR OR
WHETHER HE DREW HIS MEN OUT OF THE FRONT LINE TO GIVE ROOM FOR HIS
BARRAGES MAY NEVER BE KNOWN IT IS CERTAIN HOWEVER THAT HE LEFT
HIS FRONT LINE IMMEDIATELY FACING THE GUARDS DIVISION EMPTY AND THAT
MISCALCULATION ENABLED THE GUARDS TO LAUNCH THEIR ATTACK WITHOUT
HAVING FIRST TO FIGHT THEIR WAY ACROSS THE CANAL THE COLDSTREAM HAD
POSSESSED THEMSELVES PROMPTLY OF THE EVACUATED TRENCHES AND THERE
STAYED FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THE ENEMY REALISED WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SENT AEROPLANES TO LOCATE THE RAIDERS AND TRIEDWITHOUT SUCCESSTO
SHELL THEM BACK AGAIN IT WAS A QUICK WELLTHOUGHTOUT COUP THAT
SAVED VERY MANY GOOD LIVES

ON THE 28TH JULY THE BATTALION AFTER VARIOUS CONTRADICTORY ORDERS
WAS SENT FORWARD IN THE EVENING TO RELIEVE THE LEFT OF THE 3RD
COLDSTREAM IN THE OUTPOSTLINE THERE WAS A REPORT THAT THE ENEMY
MEDITATED AN ATTACK ON THAT BATTALION AT THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE
THIRTYEIGHTH DIVISION ON THEIR RIGHT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT
THE FRENCH WHO HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THEIR GUNS
FORWARD WERE NOT IN PLACE AND THEIR FIRST DIVISION LAY ON THE LEFT
OF THE GUARDS UP THEN WENT THE BATTALION IN THE EVENING AND
TOOK OVER THE OUTPOSTLINE FROM DOUTEUSE HOUSE TO WHERE IT JOINED
THE FRENCH FORCES TWO PLATOONS OF NO 2 COMPANY UNDER CAPTAIN R
RODAKOWSKI CROSSED THE CANAL IN THE MUD ON IMPROVISED BRIDGES OF
SLABS OF WOOD NAILED ACROSS RABBITWIRE AND CANVAS AND LAY UP IN
AN OLD GERMAN FRONT LINE THE OTHER TWO PLATOONS OCCUPIED THE OLD
BRITISH FRONT LINE ON THE CANAL BANK BATTALION HEADQUARTERS AND
AIDPOST WERE AT THE CHTEAU AS USUAL NO 1 COMPANY CAPTAIN W
C MUMFORD MC IN SUPPORT AND NO 4 COMPANY CAPTAIN LAW MC
HAD A COUPLE OF PLATOONS FORWARD AND TWO BACK THEY WERE ALL SHELLED
EQUALLY THROUGH THAT NIGHT WITH GAS AND LACHRYMAL SHELLS PLUS
BARRAGES ON HEADQUARTERS AND THE VARIOUS LINES OF SUPPORT THE GAS
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SIX CASUALTIES CHIEFLY AMONG SIGNALLERS AND
ORDERLIES WHOSE WORK KEPT THEM ON THE MOVE NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO
STRENGTHEN THE NEWLY OCCUPIED TRENCHES AS THERE WAS NO WIRE ON THE
SPOT FOR THE RE PARTIES TRYING TO BRING IT UP WERE PINNED TILL
DAYLIGHT BY BACKBARRAGES

ON THE 29TH JULY A PATROL WAS SENT OUT TO LOOK AT A CONCRETE
BLOCKHOUSE WHICH OUR ARTILLERY REPORTED THEY WERE UNABLE TO DESTROY
WITH THE GUNS THAT WERE IN USE AT THE MOMENT THE PATROL DREW FIRE
FROM THE BLOCKHOUSE WENT ON INTO THE DARK AND FOUND THAT THE
ENEMYS LINE BEHIND IT WAS HELD BY SMALL POSTS ONLY RETURNING IT
WOULD SEEM THAT THEY WERE FIRED AT AGAIN AN NCO AND A MAN BEING
WOUNDED BUT THEY WOUNDED AND CAPTURED A PRISONER WHO SAID THAT
THE POST HELD TWENTY MEN WHEREUPON THAT BLOCKHOUSE WAS KEPT UNDER
OBSERVATION BY SMALL PARTIES OF OUR MEN UNDER LIEUTENANT BUDD MC
NEXT MORNING THEY OBSERVED FIVE OR SIX OF THE ENEMY LYING OUT IN
SHELLHOLES ROUND THE BLOCKHOUSE WHICH WAS TOO SMALL FOR THE WHOLE
OF ITS GARRISON THIS OVERFLOW WAS ALL SNIPED IN DUE COURSE TILL
THE BLOCKHOUSE WITH FOURTEEN UNWOUNDED PRISONERS SURRENDERED WAS
ABSORBED INTO OUR OUTPOSTLINE AND HELD AGAINST THE ENEMYS FIRE
CONSIDERING THAT FIRE AT THE TIMEWHICH INCLUDED 59S 42S AND
77SIT WAS A NEATLY EXPEDITIOUS AFFAIR THE BATTALION WAS RELIEVED
BY THE 1ST GRENADIERS AND THE WELSH AND WENT BACK TO CAMP IN THE
FOREST AREA TO SPEND THE 30TH JULY PREPARING THEMSELVES AND THEIR
SOULS FOR THE MORROWS WORK

THE GUARDS DIVISION LAY AS WE KNOW BETWEEN THE FIRST FRENCH
DIVISION ON ITS LEFT AND OUR THIRTYEIGHTH DIVISION ON ITS RIGHT
THE LINE OF THE YPRESSTADEN RAILWAY WITH ITS BLOCKHOUSES MARKING
THE LIMIT BETWEEN THE TWO BRITISH DIVISIONS THIS WAS AN AWKWARD
JUNCTION WHICH CAUSED TROUBLE LATER FOUR OBJECTIVES WERE LAID
DOWN THE FIRST WAS THE NEAREST GERMAN SYSTEM OF TRENCHES WHICH HAD
LAIN UNDER SEARCHING ARTILLERYFIRE FOR SOME TIME AND WOULD NOT BE
DIFFICULT THE SECOND SIX HUNDRED YARDS FARTHER ON RAN PARALLEL TO
THE PILCKEM ROAD THE THIRD AN IMAGINARY LINE A HUNDRED YARDS BEYOND
THE WELLKNOWN IRON CROSS KORTIKAARCABARET ROAD BEYOND PILCKEM
RIDGE AND THE LAST WENT UP TO THE STEENBEEK RIVER THE TOTAL DEPTH
OF THE RUN WAS ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THE CANAL BANK

THE 2ND PONSONBYS AND THE 3RD SEYMOURS BRIGADES WERE TO TAKE
THE FIRST THREE OBJECTIVES AFTER WHICH THE 1ST JEFFREYSS BRIGADE
FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND WAS TO COME THROUGH AND TAKE THE FOURTH
THE 2ND BRIGADE WHICH WAS ON THE RIGHT OF THE DIVISION HELD
THE FRONT FROM THE YPRESSTADEN RAILWAYBRIDGE OVER THE CANAL TO
BOESINGHE BRIDGE THE 3RD BRIGADE CONTINUED THE LINE TO THE LEFT FOR
SIX HUNDRED YARDS THE 1ST BRIGADE LESS THE 1ST IRISH AND THE 3RD
COLDSTREAM WHICH WERE UNDER THE DIRECT ORDERS OF GENERAL FEILDING
GOC GUARDS DIVISION WAS IN RESERVE

OUR BARRAGES CONCEIVED ON A MOST GENEROUS SCALE WERE TIMED TO CREEP
AT A HUNDRED YARDS IN FOUR MINUTES THEY WERE PUT DOWN AT 350 A M
JULY 31 A DARK MISTY MORNING ON THE EDGE OF RAIN AND THE WHOLE
ATTACK WENT FORWARD WITH SATISFYING PRECISION SO FAR AS THE GUARDS
DIVISION WAS CONCERNED THE VARIOUS OBJECTIVES WERE REACHED AT THE
GIVEN TIMES AND LEVEL WITH THE FRENCH ADVANCE BY ELEVEN OCLOCK THE
FARTHEST WAS IN OUR HANDS AND WHAT DIFFICULTIES THERE WERE AROSE
FROM THE DIVISION ON THE GUARDS RIGHT BEING HELD UP AMONG UNREDUCED
BLOCKHOUSES ENFILADING THEM FROM THE RAILWAY LINE

MEANTIME THE 1ST BATTALION IRISH GUARDS SPENT THE DAY AFTER
BREAKFAST AT A QUARTERPAST FIVE IN RESERVE ROUND THE LITTLE
TWOROOMED SANDBAGGED AND CONCRETED CHASSEUR FARM WHERE THERE
WAS AN APPLETREE WITH ALL ITS LEAVES ON UNDER HALF AN HOURS
NOTICE TO MOVE UP IF REQUIRED BUT NO ORDER CAME THEY WERE SHELLED
INTERMITTENTLY ALL DAY WITH A FEW CASUALTIES AND CAPTAIN F S LAW
WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED THE EVENING AS PESSIMISTS PROPHESIED CLOSED
IN HEAVY RAIN AND THE GROUND BEGAN TO GO THEY STAYED WHERE THEY
WERE TILL THE AFTERNOON OF THE 1ST AUGUST WHEN WORD CAME TO TAKE
OVER THE LINE HELD BY THE 3RD GRENADIERS AND THE 1ST COLDSTREAM ON
THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD OBJECTIVES

THEY MOVED OUT IN RAIN INTO THE USUAL WILDERNESS OF SHELLHOLES
FILLING WITH WATER BUT FOR THE MOMENT WERE NOT SHELLED NO
4 COMPANY WENT BY DAYLIGHT TO ITS POSITIONS ON THE FIRST
OBJECTIVECARIBOO WOOD AND SOME HALFWIPEDOUT GERMAN TRENCHSYSTEMS
IN A PARTLY DESTROYED WOOD THE OTHER COMPANIES WAITED TILL DUSK
BEFORE DISTRIBUTING THEMSELVES ON THE GREEN LINETHE THIRD
OBJECTIVEWHICH WAS ABOUT A THOUSAND YARDS THIS SIDE THE STEENBEEK
RIVER WHILE THE MOVE WAS IN PROGRESS A BRIGADE OF THE THIRTYEIGHTH
DIVISION REPORTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHELLED OUT OF THEIR ADVANCED
POSITIONS ON THE RIVER AND WERE FALLING BACK WHICH AS FAR AS
COULD BE SEEN WOULD LEAVE THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE GUARDS DIVISION
IN THE AIR IF THIS WERE SO AND THE DUSK AND THE RAIN MADE IT
DIFFICULT TO JUDGE IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO PUT EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE
AND FORM A DEFENSIVE FLANK ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE THAT SEPARATED
THE TWO DIVISIONS THE COMPANIES WERE DIVERTED ACCORDINGLY HASTILY
REDIRECTED IN THE DARK AND WHEN ALL WAS DONE THE BRIGADE THAT HAD
MADE THE TROUBLE WENT BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION ON THE FURTHER
OBJECTIVE THERE WAS SMALL CHOICE OF SLEEPINGPLACES THAT NIGHT
SUCH GERMAN BLOCKHOUSES AS CAME HANDIEST WERE USED FOR BATTALION
AND COMPANY HEADQUARTERS WHILE THE COMPANIES LAY OUT IN THE WET AND
TALKED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF HOT MEALS THEY WERE NOT VERY SEVERELY
SHELLED BUT WHEN AUGUST 2 BROKE IN HEAVY RAIN AND THE BRIGADE ON
THEIR RIGHT CONTINUED TO SEND UP SOSS AT INTERVALS THEREBY OBLIGING
THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR FLANK ON THE RAILWAY LINE THEY FELT THAT
CONDITIONS WERE BECOMING EXCEEDINGLY TRYING AS THE DIARY SAYS
THEN CAME A RELIEF WHICH WAS AT LEAST A CHANGE THE 1ST SCOTS
GUARDS RELIEVED THE TWO PLATOONS OF NO 4 COMPANY BACK IN CARIBOO
TRENCHES WHERE THE SHELLING WAS LIGHT AND LATER AS DARKNESS FELL
SET THE OTHER COMPANIES FREE TO GO FORWARD AND RELIEVE THE 2ND
GRENADIERS AT THE FRONT OF THINGS THE CHANGEOVER TOOK FIVE HOURS
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT THE BRIGADE ON THEIR RIGHT ONCE MORE SENT UP
SOSS WHICH BROUGHT DOWN A GERMAN BARRAGE AND NECESSITATED EVERY
ONE STANDING TO FOR DEVELOPMENTS IT PROVED A FALSE ALARM AND NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE ENEMYAN OMISSION WHICH IT IS CONCEIVABLE
THE GUARDS DIVISION RATHER REGRETTED BEYOND QUESTION THAT BRIGADE
HAD BEEN BADLY HELD UP AMONG THE BLOCKHOUSES AND HAD BEEN SAVAGELY
SHELLED IN AND OUT OF SHELLHOLES THAT BEWILDER TROOPS BUTTILL
THEIR OWN TROUBLE COMESNO TROOPS GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE
EXCUSES FOR A NIGHTMARE OF SOSS THERES ENOUGH FATIGUES YELL
UNDERSTAND WHEN YOURE OUT O THE LINE EXTRA FATIGUES IN ACTION
LIKE DEFENSIVE FLANKS IS OUTRAGEOUS

THEY WERE SHELLED AND RAINED UPON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT
OF THE 2ND AUGUST AND ON THE EVENING OF THE 3RD STILL IN CEASELESS
RAIN WERE RELIEVED BY THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS AND MARCHED THROUGH
MUD WATER AND DARKNESS OVER BROKEN GROUND BEYOND DESCRIPTION TO
ELVERDINGHE SIDING WHERE THEY WERE PACKED INTO TRUCKS AT FIVE IN THE
MORNING AND TAKEN TO POLL HILL CAMP NEAR BANDAGHEM FOR TRAINING

THEIR CASUALTIES ALL THINGS RECKONED HAD BEEN VERY LIGHT THEY HAD
GONE INTO ACTION ON THE 31ST JULY WITH 26 OFFICERS AND 1002 OTHER
RANKS AND HAD LOST ONLY 2 OFFICERS AND 125 OTHER RANKS FROM ALL
CAUSES

THE TOTAL CASUALTIES FOR THE TWELVE BATTALIONS OF THE GUARDS DIVISION
IN THE ACTION HAD BEEN 59 OFFICERS AND 1876 MEN IN TWO DAYS AND RAIN
FALLING WITHOUT A BREAK FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS DROWNED OUT THE SAD
FIGHT THE ENEMYS LINE HAD BEEN PUSHED BACK FROM BIXSCHOOTE THROUGH
FREZENBERG WESTHOEK STIRLING CASTLE AND SHREWSBURY FOREST DOWN
TO HOLLEBEKE AT THAT STAGE OUR ARMIES AS HAD HAPPENED SO OFTEN
ON THE SOMME WERE IMMOBILISED THE CLAY GROUND WAS CULLENDERED AND
PUNCHED BY THE SHELLS INTO CHAINS OF POOLS AND PONDS ALL VALLEYS
AND HOLLOWS TURNED INTO BOGS WHERE IF MEN WANDERED FROM THE REGULAR
TRACKS ACROSS THEM THEY DROWNED OR WERE MIRED TO DEATH IF THEY
STAYED ON THE PLANKINGS THE ENEMYS GUNS SWEPT THEM AWAY WHEN ALL
HAD BEEN DONE THAT MAN COULD DO THE FIRST PHASE OF THE THIRD BATTLE
OF YPRES CLOSED IN A STRENGTHENED CONVICTION THAT ALL THE POWERS OF
EVIL WERE IN STRICT ALLIANCE WITH GERMANY OUR ARMIES HELD OFF SEVEN
COUNTERATTACKS ALONG THE LINE SETTLED THEMSELVES IN IT AND THEN
PERFORCE WAITED FOR THE WEATHER TO CLEAR

IT RAINED ON AND OFF TILL THE 15TH AUGUST AND AS MOST OF THE CORN
IN THE FIELDS ROUND POLL HILL CAMP HAD OWING TO THE WET NOT BEEN
CUT TRAININGGROUND WAS LIMITED JUST AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THE NEW
GERMAN SYSTEM OF HOLDING A LINE WITH A CHAIN OF CAREFULLY CAMOUFLAGED
POSTS CALLED FOR A CHANGE IN ATTACK METHODS SO THE BATTALION WAS
PRACTISED IN SURPRISE SITUATIONSIE DISCOVERING INVISIBLE
ENEMIES WITH MACHINEGUNS IN SHELLHOLES THAT TURNED THE ADVANCING
LINE INTO A RAGGED SCATTERING SCRUM THEIR DUMMY BARRAGES WERE
SLOWED TOO AS THE DIARY SAYS TO ENABLE THE SURPRISE SITUATIONS
TO BE DEALT WITH AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE LINE TO REFORM BEHIND
THE BARRAGE AFTER HAVING DEALT WITH THESE SITUATIONS THIS WAS A
KIND OF WORK FOR WHICH LIKE BOMBING THE IRISH HAD CONSIDERABLE
NATURAL APTITUDES IT WAS SUMMED UP UNOFFICIALLY THUS IN THE
OULD DAYS A TRENCH WAS A TRENCH YELL UNDERSTAND AN SOMETHING
TO LAY HOULD UPON THIRD YPRES WAS FAILIN INTO NOTHIN AND THEN
FINDIN TWAS TWO PILLBOXES AN A FORT ON YOUR FLANK THEREFORE
THE SPECIALISTS IN THE SHAPE OF THE LEWISGUNNER AND THE MOPPERUP
WHO DEALT WITH THE DBRIS OF ATTACKS WERE IMPORTANT PERSONS AND WERE
INSTRUCTED ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE BATTALION WAS NOT INDENTED UPON FOR
WORKINGPARTIES ON THE GUNTRACKS AND BRIDGES ROUND BOESINGHE


THIRD YPRES AND THE BROEMBEEK

ON AUGUST 1 LIEUTENANT THE HON P J OGILVY JOINED THE BATTALION AND
TOOK OVER NO 1 COMPANY FROM ACTING CAPTAIN W C MUMFORD WHO HAD
BEEN APPOINTED TOWN MAJOR OF THE BUSY AND OCCASIONALLY BATTERED TOWN
OF ELVERDINGHE AND LIEUTENANT E BUDD TOOK OVER THE 4TH COMPANY FROM
ACTING CAPTAIN H F DA S LAW WOUNDED

ON THE 15TH AUGUST THE EVE OF THE LANGEMARCK ATTACK THEY WERE
PUT ON ONE HOURS NOTICE WHICH WAS WITHDRAWN THE NEXT DAY WHEN
SIX DIVISIONS THE FORTYEIGHTH ELEVENTH FIFTYSIXTH EIGHTH
TWENTIETH AND TWENTYNINTH STRUCK AGAIN ALONG THE LINE FROM THE
MENIN ROAD TO OUR JUNCTION WITH THE FRENCH IN THE NORTH THE WEATHER
ONCE MORE BLINDED OUR AEROPLANES SO THAT OUR ARTILLERY COULD NOT
DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE COUNTERATTACKS THE PILLBOXES HELD UP
OUR INFANTRY AND THOUGH PRISONERS GUNS AND A LITTLE GROUND ROUND
LANGEMARCK WERE GAINED THE LINE OF THE SALIENT FROM ST JULIEN
SOUTHWARDS STOOD AS IT HAD SINCE THE FIRST THE BATTALION WAS
PEACEFULLY AT BOMBPRACTICE ON THAT DAY AND BY SOME OVERSIGHT A LIVE
BOMB GOT MIXED UP WITH THE DUMMIES AND CAUSED THIRTEEN CASUALTIES
LUCKILY NONE OF THEM VERY SERIOUS AND THE TRAINING WENT FORWARD AS
THE CROPS WERE CUT GROUND WAS GRADUALLY EXTENDED AND EVERY ONE WAS
WORKED HARD AT PRACTICE ATTACKS FOR THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR LOT
WOULD BE CAST IN THE SALIENT FOR SOME TIME

ON THE 27TH AUGUST MEDAL RIBBONS WERE PRESENTED BY THE GENERAL OF
THE 1ST BRIGADE TO THOSE WHO HAD WON HONOUR IN THE BOESINGHE BATTLE
EITHER BY THEIR COOLHEADEDNESS IN DEALING WITH SURPRISE SITUATIONS

ON THE LAST DAYS OF AUGUST THEY MARCHED TO PROVEN SIDING AND
ENTRAINED FOR ELVERDINGHE AND THENCE TO DULWICH CAMP WELL KNOWN AS
BEING SOMEWHAT EXPOSED AND LIABLE TO LONGRANGE SHELLFIRE THEY
WERE USED AT ONCE BY THE GREEDY RES FOR BURYING CABLES AND MAKING
ARTILLERYTRACKS PREPARATORY TO THE NEXT MOVE IN THE INTERMINABLE
THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES

FROM THE 1ST TO THE 4TH SEPTEMBER THEY WITH THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE
WERE IN SUPPORT TO THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE WHICH WAS IN THE LINE
AND SENT UP ABOUT HALF THEIR STRENGTH FOR CARRYINGPARTIES EVERY
NIGHT THE LINE SWAMPY AND OVERLOOKED BY THE HIGH GROUND UNDER
HOUTHULST FOREST TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST CONSISTED OF POSTS IN
SHELLHOLESTHE SHELLHOLES BEING IMPROVED ONLY JUST SUFFICIENTLY
TO MAKE THEM HABITABLE THE STANDARD OF COMFORT IN THE SALIENT
AT THAT TIME WAS LOWER THAN ON THE SOMME WHERE MEN WERE DYING
AT LEAST DRY ALL POSTS WERE ELABORATELY CONCEALED FROM OVERHEAD
OBSERVATION FOR THE ENEMY AEROPLANES ROVED OVER THEM BOMBING AND
MACHINEGUNNING AT LARGE THOUGH THE BATTALION WAS LUCKY IN ITS FOUR
DAYS TURN IT LOST ON THE NIGHT OF THE 4TH SEPTEMBER 2ND LIEUTENANT
G P BOYD AND FOUR MEN KILLED AND TWENTYTHREE WOUNDED SOME OF THE
OTHER BATTALIONS IN SUPPORT SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM BOMBING RAIDS AND
ALL BACKAREAS WERE REGULARLY RAKED OVER SO THAT THE TROOPS MIGHT BE
WORRIED BY LOSS OF SLEEP

FROM THE 5TH TO THE 8TH THEY LAY IN RUGBY CAMP IN RESERVE TO THE
2ND COLDSTREAM AND 2ND GRENADIERS OF THEIR OWN BRIGADE IN THE FRONT
LINE HERE THEY ENJOYED A FAIRLY QUIET TIME AND HAD ONLY TO FIND
A HUNDRED MEN OR SO PER NIGHT FOR FORWARDAREA WORK RUGBY DULWICH
AND THE OTHER CAMPS WERE ALL DULY AND REGULARLY BOMBED SHELLED AND
GASSED BUT THAT WAS ACCEPTED AS PART OF THE DAILY AND NIGHTLY WORK

ON THE 9TH THEY WERE UP AT THE FRONT AMONG THE JUST SUFFICIENTLY
HABITABLE SHELLHOLES OF THE GREEN LINE BEYOND THE IRON CROSS
KORTIKAARCABARET ROAD FROM THE YPRESSTADEN RAILWAY TO THE JUNCTION
WITH THE FRENCH THEIR GUIDES MET THEM AT BOIS FARM FIFTEEN HUNDRED
YARDS BACK AND SINCE ONCE AMONG THE HOLES ALL FOOD SENT UP RISKED
THE LIFE OR MUTILATION OF A MAN THEY CARRIED TWO DAYS RATIONS AND
PICKED UP THEIR WATER FROM A DECAUVILLE RAILWAY THAT RAN TO THE
TERMINUS DAILY BOMBED AND BOMBARDED ON THE WIJDEN DRIFT ROAD
WHILE THE LAST TWO COMPANIES NOS 2 AND 4 WERE GETTING THEIR
TINS AT RAILHEAD AN HOUR AND A HALFS BARRAGE WAS DROPPED ON THEM
AND TWENTYSEVEN MEN WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED RELIEF WAS DELAYED IN
CONSEQUENCE TILL ONE ON THE MORNING OF THE 10TH AND ABOUT AN HOUR
LATER A WANDERING COVEY OF EIGHT GERMANS WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY IN
THE DARK WERE ROUNDED UP BY THE FORWARD PLATOONS OF NO 3 COMPANY
2ND LIEUTENANT CORRY DCM IT WAS A SMALL BRISK FIGHT AND IT
CAME PLEASANTLY AFTER THE BARRAGE AT RAILHEAD AND THE SHELLING THAT
BEFELL THEM FROM THREE TO HALFPAST FIVE THEY WERE ANNOYED TOO BY
LOWFLYING ENEMY AEROPLANES WHO FIRED AT THE MEN IN THE POSTS BUT AS
A RULE MISSED THEM A DESERTER CAME IN AND PATROLS WERE SENT OUT TO
SEE WHERE THE NEAREST ENEMYPOST MIGHT BE ONE WAS LOCATED NEAR THE
RAILWAY LINE IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT COMPANY EXPLORATION WORK OF THIS
SORT IN SUCH A BLIND FRONT AS THE ENEMY HAD ARRANGED HERE ENDS ONLY
TOO OFTEN IN PATROLS LOSING THEIR WAY AS THE EIGHT GERMANS HAD DONE
AND COMPANY OFFICERS DO NOT LIKE IT

ON THE 11TH SEPTEMBER AFTER SOME ARTILLERY WORK ON OUR SIDE THE
ENEMY GUNS CARRIED OUT A SHOOT ON THE PILLBOXES OCCUPIED BY THE
RIGHT NO 1 COMPANY WHILE THEIR INFANTRY WERE UNUSUALLY ACTIVE
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE THIRTYEIGHTH DIVISION ON THE GUARDS RIGHT
WAS BEING RELIEVED THAT NIGHT BY THE TWENTIETH AS A SIDEISSUE OF
THE FIGHT THE BATTALION ON THEIR LEFT WAS ATTACKED WHICH SO FAR
AS THE IRISH GUARDS WERE CONCERNED MEANT THAT THE LEFT COMPANY
NO 2 SWIFTLY MANUFACTURED A FRESH POST ON THEIR LEFT TO IMPROVE
COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS AND PREVENT THE ENEMY WORKING
ROUND THEIR FLANK THROUGH THE REMNANTS OF A WOOD IN THIS WORK THEY
HAD TO DISPERSE WITH RIFLEFIRE SEVERAL PARTIES OF THE ENEMY WHO
MIGHT HAVE INTERFERED WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND CAPTAIN T F
MACMAHON WAS WOUNDED THIS BALD RECORD COVERS A LONG TENSE NIGHT OF
ALARMS AND FATIGUES AND FATIGUEPARTIES DROPPING LIKE PARTRIDGES
WHERE THE BARRAGE FOUND THEM TO CREEP FORWARD AS SOON AS IT WAS
LIFTED AND SOMEWHERE ON THE LEFT THE CRACKLE AND BLAZE OF AN
ATTACK ON A BATTALION WHICH WAS ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF
ITSELF

THEIR RELIEF ON THE NIGHT OF THE 13TH BY THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS WAS
VERY MUCH DELAYED TWO DETACHMENTS GOT LOST ONE THROUGH THE GUIDE
BEING KILLED AND THE OTHER THROUGH THE GUIDE LOSING HIMSELF YET IT
WAS A VERY DARK AND THEREFORE THEORETICALLY A SAFE NIGHT WITH
VERY LITTLE SHELLINGPROOF OF THE UTTER UNCERTAINTY OF EVERY DETAIL
CONNECTED WITH WAR

THEY HAD LOST IN THAT FORTNIGHT ONE OFFICER 2ND LIEUTENANT BOYD
AND FOURTEEN MEN KILLED ONE OFFICER CAPTAIN T F MACMAHON AND
SEVENTYEIGHT OTHER RANKS WOUNDED FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH THEY
WERE TRAINING IN CAMPSCARIBOO AND POLL HILLOF WHICH THE FORMER
WAS NOT OUT OF REACH OF SHELLFIRE AND STUDIED NEW METHODS OF ATTACK
TO COMBAT THE ENEMYS NEW METHODS OF DEFENCE IN HIS PROTECTED AND
FORTIFIED SHELLHOLES THESE HE NOW HELD IN DEPTH ONE SHELLHOLE
POST COVERING OR FLANKING THE NEXT SO THAT MEN FOUGHT THEIR WAY
UP A LANDSCAPE OF MINIATURE REDOUBTS INVISIBLE TO GUNS ALMOST
INVISIBLE TO AEROPLANES AND MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO REDUCE THAN THE
NARROWSLOTTED PILLBOXES

ON THE 21ST SEPTEMBER THEIR BRIGADIERGENERAL JEFFREYS SAW THE
BATTALION ON PARADE NEAR PROVEN AND BADE THEM FAREWELL ON HIS
PROMOTION TO COMMAND THE NINETEENTH DIVISION HE WAS SUCCEEDED IN
COMMAND OF THE 1ST BRIGADE BY GENERAL C R C DE CRESPIGNY ON THE
27TH LIEUTCOLONEL R V POLLOK COMMANDING THE BATTALION WHO HAD
BEEN ON LEAVE RETURNED AND TOOK OVER FROM CAPTAIN A F L GORDON
ACTING IN HIS ABSENCE ON THE 29TH LIEUTENANT B REFORD WHO HAD BEEN
ASSISTANT ADJUTANT TOOK OVER NO 3 COMPANY VICE CAPTAIN T F
MACMAHON WOUNDED ON THE 11TH AND 2ND LIEUTENANT T S V STONEY
JOINED FOR DUTY ON THE 25TH

AMONG THE HONOURS MENTIONED AS AWARDED TO THE MEN THAT MONTH FOR
GALLANTRY AND DEVOTION TO DUTY WAS THE DCM TO 5279 PRIVATE J
ROCHFORD FOR GALLANTRY DEVOTION TO DUTY AND ORGANIZING ABILITY
WHEN EMPLOYED AS A STRETCHERBEARER WITH A WORKINGPARTY ON SEPTEMBER
3 THE NIGHT WHEN LIEUTENANT BOYD AND TWENTYEIGHT MEN WERE KILLED
OR WOUNDED BY BOMBS THIS IT MAY BE NOTED IS THAT ROCHFORD WHOSE
PRESENCE STEADIED AND WHOSE JESTS DIVERTED WHOLE PLATOONS UPON THE
SOMME AND FOR WHOSE HEALTH THE MEN INQUIRED FIRST AFTER THE PLATOON
OR WORKINGPARTY HAD BEEN SHELLED

AND WHILE THEY TRAINED WITH THE UTTER SELFABSORPTION OF MEN
CONCERNED IN THE STUDY OF METHODS OF TAKING MANS LIFE THE SALIENT
HEAVED AND FLAMED DAY AFTER DAY WITH GERMAN COUNTERATTACKS AS
OUR GUNS COVERED THE ADJUSTMENT AND REINFORCEMENTS AND PROTECTION
OF ARTILLERY TROOPS AND MATERIAL IN PREPARATION FOR THE BATTLE OF
SEPTEMBER 20 AS USUAL THE WEATHER BROKE ON THE EVE OF IT TEN
DIVISIONS NINETEENTH THIRTYNINTH FORTYFIRST TWENTYTHIRD
FIRST AND SECOND AUSTRALIANS NINTH FIFTYFIFTH FIFTYEIGHTH AND
TWENTIETH ATTACKED FROM NEAR HOLLEBEKE IN THE SOUTH TO LANGEMARCK IN
THE NORTH PUSHED BACK THE LINE ON THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THEIR ATTACK
GAINED ONE MILE OUTWARDS ALONG THE DESPERATE MENIN ROAD ESTABLISHED
THEMSELVES IN POLYGON WOOD BROKE ELEVEN COUNTERATTACKS TOOK OVER
3000 PRISONERS AND LEFT AS MANY ENEMY DEAD IT WAS FOLLOWED UP
ON THE 26TH SEPTEMBER BY ANOTHER ATTACK ON A SIXMILE FRONT FROM
SOUTH OF THE MENIN ROAD TO NORTHEAST OF ST JULIEN IN WHICH SIX
DIVISIONS THIRTYNINTH THIRTYTHIRD FIFTH AND FOURTH AUSTRALIANS
FIFTYEIGHTH AND FIFTYNINTH ONCE MORE MOVED OUR LINE FORWARD ALONG
THAT FRONTAGE IN SOME PLACES NEARLY HALF A MILE OUR MOVEMENT
CLASHED ALMOST TO THE MINUTE WITH GERMAN COUNTERATTACKS BY FRESH
DIVISIONS LAUNCHED TO RECOVER THE GROUND THEY HAD LOST ON THE 20TH
SEPTEMBER AND THE FIGHTING WAS NONE THE LIGHTER FOR THAT COINCIDENCE

THE 3RD OCTOBER SAW THE WEATHER BREAK AGAIN JUST AS FIGHTING WAS
RESUMED ON A SEVENMILE FRONT FROM THE MENIN ROAD TO THE YPRESSTADEN
RAILWAY TWELVE DIVISIONS WENT IN HERE THE THIRTYSEVENTH FIFTH
TWENTYFIRST SEVENTH FIRST SECOND AND THIRD AUSTRALIANS THE NEW
ZEALAND FORTYEIGHTH ELEVENTH FOURTH AND TWENTYNINTH REUTEL
NORDEMHOCK AND BROODSEINDE VILLAGES WERE TAKEN ABRAHAM HEIGHTS
GAINED THE GRAVENSTAFEL SPUR CLEARED BY THE NEW ZEALANDERS THREE
FRESH GERMAN DIVISIONS WERE CAUGHT BY OUR GUNS ALMOST IN THE ACT
OF FORMING UP FOR ATTACK AND 5000 PRISONERS WERE PASSED BACK THE
ENEMYS LOSSES HERE WERE VERY SATISFACTORY AND MAINLY DUE TO OUR
GUNFIRE

ON THE 5TH OCTOBER THEN SO FAR AS THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS
CONCERNED THE LINE OF OUR WORKING FRONT RAN THROUGH POELCAPPELLE
AND THENCE BACK TO THE YPRESSTADEN RAILWAY AT A POINT SOME THOUSAND
YARDS NORTH OF LANGEMARCK FROM THAT POINT IT MERGED INTO THE OLD
LINE GAINED ON THE 20TH OF SEPTEMBER WHICH FOLLOWED THE BROEMBEEK
RIVER AT A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE SOUTH OF IT TOWARDS OUR JUNCTION
WITH THE FRENCH AND THENCE LOST ITSELF IN THE FLOODED AREAS BEYOND
NOORDSCHOOTE NO WEIGHT OF ATTACK HAD FALLEN ON THAT SECTOR OF THE
FRONT SINCE SEPTEMBER 20 WHEN LANGEMARCK HAD BEEN CAPTURED AND THE
FRENCH LINE WITH OURS ADVANCED IN THE DIRECTION OF DRAIBACH AND
HOUTHULST FOREST


THE BROEMBEEK

IT WAS DECIDED TO RENEW THE ATTACK IN COMBINATION WITH THE FRENCH
HERE ON THE 9TH OCTOBER FROM NORTHWEST OF LANGEMARCK ACROSS THE
YPRESSTADEN RAILWAY DOWN TO A POINT IN THE LINE GAINED ON THE 4TH
OCTOBER EAST OF ZONNEBEKE ON A FRONT OF SIX MILES THE WEATHER
PREPARED ITSELF IN ADVANCE RAIN BEGAN PUNCTUALLY ON THE 7TH
CONTINUED THROUGH THE 8TH AND MADE THE GOING MORE THAN USUALLY
UNSPEAKABLE IT AFFECTED THE GUARDS DIVISION PRINCIPALLY SINCE
THEIR SHARE OF THE WORK INVOLVED CROSSING THE LITTLE VALLEY OF THE
BROEMBEEK RIVER WHICH SHOULD IT CONTINUE TO FLOOD OFFERED EVERY
POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOLDING UP TROOPS UNDER FIRE LOSS OF
DIRECTION SINCE MEN NEVER MOVE STRAIGHT ACROSS BOGS AND ENGULFMENT
OF MATERIAL THE BROEMBEEK WAS A STAGNANT DITCH FROM TWENTY TO
THIRTY FEET WIDE AND FROM TWO TO FIVE DEEP EDGED WITH SHELLHOLES
AND IN SOME PARTS CARRYING VERTICAL BANKS FOUR OR FIVE FEET DEEP
THERE WAS MERCIFULLY NO WIRE IN IT BUT NIGHTPATROLS SENT OUT THE
WEEK BEFORE THE BATTLE OF THE 9TH REPORTED IT COULD NOT BE CROSSED
WITHOUT MATS

THE 1ST BRIGADE OF THE DIVISION WHICH LAY IN RESERVE WHILE THE 3RD
BRIGADE HELD THE FRONT LINE HAD TRAINED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT POLL
HILL CAMP OVER GROUND MARKED TO REPRESENT THE GROUND THAT THE
BATTALION WOULD HAVE TO ATTACK OVER THE CERTAINTY OF BEING DRENCHED
TO THE SKIN ON A RAW OCTOBER NIGHT AS A PRELIMINARY TO TUMBLING FROM
SHELLHOLE TO SHELLHOLE TILL DAWN BETWEEN INVISIBLE MACHINEGUNS AND
SNIPERS WAS LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION OF THE MEN

ON OCTOBER 6TH THE DETAILS TO BE LEFT OUT OF THE ATTACK DEPARTED
TO JOIN THE GUARDS DIVISION REINFORCEMENT BATTALION AT HERZEELE
MEN SAY THAT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THESE REPRIEVED ONES ON THE EVE OF
ACTION WAS AS CURIOUS A SIGHT AS THE ARRIVAL OF A DRAFT FOR YELL
UNDERSTAND AT THAT TIME O THE WAR MEN KNEW TWAS ONLY PUTTING OFF
WHAT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN

THEN IN FOUL WEATHER THE BATTALION ENTRAINED FOR ELVERDINGHE WITH
THE 3RD COLDSTREAM OF THEIR BRIGADE THE IDEA WAS THAT THE 1ST
BRIGADE DE CRESPIGNYS WOULD ATTACK PARALLEL TO THE LINE OF THE
YPRESSTADEN RAILWAY ON THEIR RIGHT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YARDS FROM
IT THE 2ND BRIGADE SERGISONBROOKES ON THEIR LEFT NEXT AGAINST
THE FRENCH WITH THE 3RD BRIGADE SEYMOURS IN SUPPORT THIS LAST
BRIGADE HAD BEEN VERY HEAVILY USED IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE
DIVISION TO CROSS THE BROEMBEEK PILING DUMPS AND HELPING TO HAUL
GUNS INTO FRESH POSITIONS THROUGH THE MUD THE FURTHEST OBJECTIVE
SET FOR THE ADVANCE WAS THE EDGE OF THE HOUTHULST FOREST THREE
THOUSAND YARDS ACROSS SEMIFLUID COUNTRY WITH NO LANDMARKS OTHER
THAN THE LINE OF SMASHED RAIL ON THEIR RIGHT AND WHATEVER FORTIFIED
HOUSES FARMS PILLBOXES AND SHELLHOLES THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER DURING
THEIR PROGRESS WHEN THEY HAD OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES THEY WERE
INSTRUCTED TO DIG IN ON THE EDGE OF THE FOREST

AT 930 ON THE NIGHT OF THE 8TH IN HEAVY RAIN THE BATTALION MARCHED
FROM ABINGLEY CAMP TO THEIR ASSEMBLY LINES THESE ALL DULY MARKED
BY TAPES AND WHITE SIGNBOARDS WHICH TO THE IMAGINATIVE SUGGEST
GRAVEYARDS FROM ELVERDINGHE TO BOESINGHE ROAD UP CLARGES STREET
TO ABRI WOOD AND THEN TO CANNES FARM TILL THEY MET THE GUIDES
FOR THEIR ASSEMBLY AREAS AT RUISSEAU FARM FROM HERE BEGAN THE
INTERMINABLE DUCKBOARDS THAT HALT AND CONGEST THE SLOWMOVING LINE
AND IT WAS NOT TILL FOUR IN THE MORNING THAT THE BATTALION WAS FORMED
UP AND MOVED OFF THE RAIN HAD STOPPED A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND
A LATE MOON CAME TO THEIR HELP

THE COMPANIES WERE COMMANDED AS FOLLOWS NO 1 CAPTAIN THE HON P
J OGILVY NO 2 LIEUTENANT D S BROWNE NO 3 CAPTAIN R B S
REFORD NO 4 LIEUTENANT N B BAGENAL

THERE WAS SOME SHELLING AS THEY GOT INTO THEIR ASSEMBLY POSITIONS
AT 520 A M BUT CASUALTIES WERE FEW THE 2ND GRENADIERS AND 2ND
COLDSTREAM LED OFF UNDER A FEW MINUTES BLAST OF INTENSE FIRE FROM
FIELDGUNS AND STOKES MORTARS CROSSED THE BROEMBEEK AND WERE AWAY
AT 620 THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS AND 3RD COLDSTREAM FOLLOWED THEM THE
BATTALIONS CROSSINGPLACE AT THE RIVER WHICH AFTER ALL PROVED
NOT SO UNMANAGEABLE AS THE PATROLS REPORTED HAD NO BRIDGES BUT
THERE WAS WIRE ENOUGH ON THE BANKS TO HAVE MADE TROUBLE HAD THE ENEMY
CHOSEN THAT TIME AND PLACE TO SHELL THEY WENT OVER IN THREEFOOT
WATER WITH MUD AT THE BOTTOM REFORMED WET AND FILTHY AND FOLLOWED
THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHO HAD CAPTURED THE FIRST AND SECOND OBJECTIVES
MOVED THROUGH THEM AT 820 AND FORMED UP ON THE RIGHT OF THE 3RD
COLDSTREAM UNDER THE BARRAGE OF OUR GUNS FOR THEIR OWN ADVANCE ON THE
FINAL OBJECTIVETHE EDGE OF THE FOREST

SO FAR BARRING A TENDENCY TO BEAR TOWARDS THE RIGHT OR RAILWAY SIDE
DIRECTION HAD BEEN WELL KEPT AND THEIR LOSSES WERE NOT HEAVY THE
COMPANIES DEPLOYED FOR ATTACK ON THE NEW LINES NECESSITATED BY THE
ALTERED GERMAN SYSTEM OF DEFENSEMOPPINGUP SECTIONS IN REAR OF THE
LEADING COMPANIES WITH LEWISGUN SECTIONS AND A MOPPINGUP PLATOON
BUSY BEHIND ALL

MEANTIME THE TROOPS ON THE BATTALIONS RIGHT HAD BEEN DELAYED IN
COMING UP AND THEIR DELAY WAS MORE MARKED FROM THE SECOND OBJECTIVE
ONWARD THIS DID NOT CHECK THE GUARDS ADVANCE BUT IT EXPOSED THE
BATTALIONS RIGHT TO A CRUEL FLANKING FIRE FROM SNIPERS AMONG THE
SHELLHOLES ON THE UNCLEARED GROUND BY THE YPRESSTADEN LINE THERE
WERE PILLBOXES OF CONCRETE IN FRONT THERE WAS A FORTIFIED FARM
BURIED IN SANDBAGS EGYPT HOUSE TO BE REDUCED THERE WERE NESTS
OF MACHINEGUNS ON THE RIGHT WHICH THE TROOPS ON THE RIGHT HAD NOT
YET OVERRUN AND THERE WAS AN ALMOST SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT FIGHT
IN AND ROUND SOME BRICKFIELDS WHICH IN TURN WERE COVERED BY
THE FIRE OF SNIPERS FROM THE FRINGES OF THE FOREST ENEMY AIRCRAFT
SKIMMING LOW GAVE THE GERMAN ARTILLERY EVERY HELP IN THEIR POWER
AND THE ENEMYS SHELLING WAS ACCURATE ACCORDINGLY THE ONLY THING
THAT LACKED IN THE FIGHT WAS THE BAYONET THE AFFAIR RESOLVED
ITSELF INTO A SERIES OF SPLASHING RUSHES FROM ONE SHELLHOLE TO
THE NEXT TERRIERWORK ROUND THE PILLBOXES INCESSANT DEMANDS FOR
THE LEWISGUNS RIFLEGRENADES BUT NO BOMBS WERE EMPLOYED EXCEPT
BY THE REGULAR BOMBING SECTIONS AND MOPPERSUP WHO CLEARED THE
UNDERGROUND SHELTERS AND THE HARDEST SORT OF PERSONAL ATTENTION
FROM THE OFFICERS AND NCOS ALL FOUR COMPANIES REACHED THE FINAL
OBJECTIVE MIXED UP TOGETHER AND SINCE THEIR RIGHT WAS WELL IN THE
AIR BY THE REASON OF THE DELAY OF THE FLANKING TROOPS THEY HAD
TO MAKE A DEFENSIVE FLANK TO CONNECT WITH A BATTALION OF THE NEXT
DIVISION THAT CAME UP LATER IT WAS THEN THAT THEY WERE WORST SNIPED
FROM THE SHELLHOLES AND THE CASUALTIES AMONG THE OFFICERS WHO HAD
TO SUPERINTEND THE FORMING OF THE FLANK WERE HEAVIEST THERE WAS NOT
MUCH SHELLING THROUGH THE DAY THEY WAITED WERE SNIPED AND EXPECTED
A COUNTERATTACK WHICH DID NOT COME OFF THOUGH IN THE EVENING THE
ENEMY WAS SEEN TO BE ADVANCING AND THE TROOPS ON THE BATTALIONS
RIGHT FELL BACK FOR A WHILE LEAVING THEIR FLANK ONCE MORE EXPOSED
THEIR POSITION AT THE TIME WAS IN A SOMEWHAT AWKWARD SALIENT AND
THEY READJUSTED THEMSELVESALWAYS UNDER SNIPING FIREDUG IN AGAIN
AS MUCH AS WET GROUND ALLOWED AND MANAGED IN THE DARK TO ESTABLISH
CONNECTION WITH A BATTALION OF HAMPSHIRES THAT HAD COME UP ON THEIR
RIGHT

THEY SPENT THE NIGHT OF THE 9TH OCTOBER WHERE THEY LAY IN THE
FRONT LINE WHILE THE ENEMY SNIPED THEM SHELLED THEIR SUPPORTS
OR PUT DOWN SUDDEN WANDERING BARRAGES FROM FRONT TO BACK EVERY
COMPANY COMMANDER HAD BEEN KILLED OR WOUNDED DURING THE DAY THEIR
MEDICAL OFFICER CAPTAIN P R WOODHOUSE MC WAS WOUNDED AT DUTY
ON THE 10TH THE MEN WERE CAKED WITH MUD AND OOZE WORN TO THEIR
LAST NERVES AND BADLY IN NEED OF FOOD AND HOT DRINKS THERE WAS
NO INFANTRY ACTION ON THEIR FRONT HOWEVER THROUGHOUT THE 10TH
AND IN THE EVENING THEY WERE RELIEVED BY TWO COMPANIES OF THE 1ST
GRENADIERS THE OTHER TWO COMPANIES OF THAT BATTALION RELIEVING THE
2ND GRENADIERS IN THE SUPPORTLINE THE BATTLE WHICH COUNTED AS A
SUCCESSFUL MINOR OPERATION IN THE GREAT SCHEMES OF THE THIRD BATTLE
OF YPRES HAD COST THEM FOUR OFFICERS KILLED IN ACTION ON THE 9TH
ONE DIED OF WOUNDS ON THE 11TH SEVEN OFFICERS AND THEIR DOCTOR
WOUNDED IN THE TWO DAYS FORTYSEVEN OTHER RANKS KILLED ONE HUNDRED
AND FIFTYEIGHT WOUNDED AND TEN MISSING AMONG THE HORRORS OF THE
SWAMPY PITTED GROUND THE LIST RUNS

IT TOOK THEM EIGHT HOURS ALONG THE TAPED TRACKS AND THE DUCKBOARDS
TO GET TO RUGBY CAMP BEHIND BOESINGHE WHERE THEY STAYED FOR THE
NEXT TWO DAYS AND DREW A COUPLE OF OFFICERS AND A HUNDRED MEN FROM
THE DIVISIONAL REINFORCEMENT BATTALION TO REPLACE SOME OF THEIR
CASUALTIES

ON THE 13TH OCTOBER THEY WITH THEIR BRIGADE TOOK OVER THE SUPPORT
LINE ON THE OLD BATTLEFRONT FROM VARIOUS UNITS OF THE 2ND AND 3RD
GUARDS BRIGADE THE 2ND GRENADIERS RELIEVED THE 1ST GRENADIERS
IN THE FRONT LINE ON THE RIGHT AND THE 2ND COLDSTREAM THE WELSH
GUARDS ON THE LEFT SECTOR THE BATTALION ITSELF WAS SCATTERED BY
COMPANIES AND HALFCOMPANIES NEAR KOEKUITLOUVOIS FARM CRAONNE
FARM AND ELSEWHERE RELIEVING COMPANIES AND HALFCOMPANIES OF THE
OTHER BATTALIONS AND STANDING BY TO ATTEND SMARTLY TO THE NEEDS
OF THE FORWARD BATTALIONS IN CASE OF SUDDEN CALLS FOR MORE BOMBS
SMALLARM AMMUNITION AND LIGHTS THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TOO TO BE
READY TO SUPPORT EITHER FLANK SHOULD THE TROOPS THERE GIVE WAY
BUT THE TROOPS DID NOT GIVE WAY AND THEY HAD NOTHING WORSE TO
FACE THAN HEAVY SHELLING OF THE SUPPORTS AT NIGHT AND THE WORK OF
CONTINUING THE DUCKBOARDTRACKS ACROSS THE MUD MOST OF THE MEN
WERE ACCOMMODATED IN SHELLHOLES AND SMALL SHALLOW TRENCHES
FOR WATER STOPPED THE SPADE AT A COUPLE OF FEET BELOW GROUND BUT
WHERE ANYTHING USABLE REMAINED OF THE GERMAN PILLBOXES WHICH
SMELT ABOMINABLY THE MEN WERE PACKED INTO THEM IT WAS IN NO WAY A
PLEASANT TOUR FOR THE DEAD LAY THICK ABOUT AND MEN HAD NOT CEASED
SPEAKING OF THEIR OFFICERS OF THE WEEK BEFOREINTIMATELY LOVINGLY
AND HUMOROUSLY AS THE IRISH USED TO DO

MORE THAN MOST THE ADVANCE ON HOUTHULST FOREST HAD BEEN AN OFFICERS
BATTLE FOR THEIR WORK HAD BEEN BROKEN UP BY THE NATURE OF THE
GROUND AND THE POSITION OF THE GERMAN PILLBOXES INTO DETACHED
PARTIES DEALING WITH SEPARATE STRONG POINTS WHO HAD TO BE COLLECTED
AND FORMED AGAIN AFTER EACH BOUT HAD ENDED BUT THIS WORK CONCEIVED
AND CARRIED OUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT UNDER THE WINGS OF DEATH
LEAVES FEW HISTORIANS

THEY WERE RELIEVED ON THE 16TH OCTOBER BY THE 20TH LANCASHIRE
FUSILIERS OF THE 104TH BRIGADE ON THEIR RIGHT RETURNED TO
ELVERDINGHE THROUGH BOESINGHE AND ENTRAINED FOR A PEACEFUL CAMP AT
PROVEN DURING THEIR THREE DAYS TOUR LIEUTENANT R H S GRAYSON
AND FOURTEEN OTHER RANKS WERE WOUNDED MAINLY BY SHELL AND TWO OTHER
RANKS WERE KILLED

THEY HAD BEGUN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER WITH 28 OFFICERS AND 1081 OTHER
RANKS THEY HAD LOST IN SIXTEEN DAYS 252 OTHER RANKS AND 14 OFFICERS
KILLED OR WOUNDED NOW THEY WERE FREE FOR THE TIME TO REST REFIT
AND REORGANISE IN READINESS MEN SAID TO BE RETURNED TO THE SOMME
YELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN THOSE DAYS WE HAD GRAND CHOICE OF THE
FRYINPAN OR THE FIRE


THE RETURN TO THE SOMME AND CAMBRAI

THE SALIENT WITH ITS SENSE OF BEING EVER OVERLOOKED AND CONSTRICTED
ON EVERY SIDE FAIRLY REPRESENTS THE FRYINGPAN THE BROAD GENERAL
CONFLAGRATION OF THE SOMME THE FIRE THEY QUITTED THE FRYINGPAN
WITH SOME RELIEF ENTRAINED AT PROVEN WITH THE 3RD COLDSTREAM AND
THE 1ST BRIGADE MACHINEGUN COMPANY DETRAINED AT WATTEN BETWEEN
THE BOIS DU HAM AND THE FORT DEPERLECQUES BEYOND ST OMER AND
MARCHED TO THE PLEASANT VILLAGE OF BAYENGHEMLESEPERLECQUES WHERE
THEY HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MEETING THE 6TH BORDER REGIMENT JUST
MARCHING OUT OF THE BILLETS THAT THEY WERE TO OCCUPY THE PLACE WAS
AN INTENSIVE TRAININGCAMP SPECIALISING IN ALL THE SPECIALTIES BUT
MUSKETRY ABOVE ALL THE SOMME WAS OPEN COUNTRY WHERE SINCE THEY HAD
LEFT IT MULTITUDES OF TANKS HAD COME INTO USE FOR THE PROTECTION
OF TROOPS AND TROOPS THUS PROTECTED DO NOT NEED SO MANY BOMBERS TO
CLEAR OUT SHELLHOLES AS THEY DO IN THE SALIENT WHERE TANKS STICK
AND ARE SHELLED TO BITS IN THE MUD THE INFERENCE WAS OBVIOUS THEY
ENJOYED COMPULSORY AND VOLUNTARY MUSKETRY VARIED WITH INSPECTIONS
AND ROUTEMARCHINGS

ON THE 21ST OCTOBER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT VISITED
THEM AS SENIOR COLONEL OF THE BRIGADE OF GUARDS WAS INTRODUCED TO
ALL THE OFFICERS SPOKE TO MOST OF THE NCOS AND THE MEN WHO
HAD BEEN DECORATED DURING THE WAR THE BATTALION WAS FORMED UP IN
WALKING OUT ORDER IN THE STREETS OF THE VILLAGE TO RECEIVE HIM IT
IS ALLEGED BY SURVIVORS THAT THE SERGEANTS SAW TO IT THAT NEVER SINCE
THE IRISH GUARDS HAD BEEN FORMED WAS THERE SUCH RIGOROUS INSPECTION
OF WALKING OUT MEN BEFORE THEY FELL IN WE LOOKED LIKE ALL
BIRDCAGE WALK OF A SUNDAY

ON THE 24TH THERE JOINED FOR DUTY A DRAFT OF SIX OFFICERS MAJOR
R R C BAGGALLAY MC LIEUTENANT G K THOMPSON MC AND 2ND
LIEUTENANTS C E HAMMOND F G DE STACPOOLE T A CAREY AND E C
G LORD LIEUTENANT D J B FITZGERALD WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE 1ST
TO THE 2ND BATTALION ON THE TWENTYFIFTH WHICH WAS THE DAY CHOSEN
FOR AN INSPECTION OF THE WHOLE DIVISION BY SIR DOUGLAS HAIG IN COLD
WEATHER WITH A HIGH WIND

ON THE 6TH NOVEMBER GENERAL ANTOINE COMMANDING THE FIRST FRENCH ARMY
CORPS WHICH HAD LAIN ON THE DIVISIONS LEFT AT BOESINGHE WAS TO
PRESENT FRENCH MEDALS GAINED BY THE DIVISION BUT THANKS TO THE WET
PARADE AFTER BEING DRAWN UP AND THEREBY THOROUGHLY DRENCHED WAS
DISMISSED AND THE MEDALS PRESENTED WITHOUT REVIEW LIEUTCOLONEL R
V POLLOK COMMANDING THE BATTALION RECEIVED THE CROIX DE GUERRE
IT IS ALL A PIECE WITH HUMAN NATURE THAT THE MISERIES OF A WEEK IN
LIQUID MUD AMONG CORPSES SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITH A JEST BUT A
WET PARADE WHICH RUINS THREE OR FOUR HOURS CAREFUL PREPARATION
REGARDED AS A GRIEVOUS BURDEN FOR EVERY ONE EXCEPT THE NCOS WHO
BY TRADITION ARE SUPPOSED TO DELIGHT IN FATIGUES OF THIS ORDER

THEIR THREE WEEKS TRAINING CAME TO AN END ON THE 11TH NOVEMBER
WHEN THEY MOVED THIRTEEN MILES IN TORRENTS OF RAIN TO THE VILLAGE
OF ECQUES WHICH WAS FILLED WITH PORTUGUESE TROOPS AND BEGAN A LONG
MARCH THEY DID NOT KNOW THEIR DESTINATION BUT GUESSED WELL WHERE
THEY WERE GOING

SOME HAD ALL THE REASONS IN THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT THE DIVISION WOULD
RELIEVE THE FRENCH ON HALF A DOZEN DIFFERENT NAMED SECTORS OTHERS
WERE CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD ATTACK INDEPENDENTLY QUITE ELSEWHERE
EVEN ITALY WHERE THE CAPORETTO DISASTER HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE WAS
TO THE IMAGINATIVE QUITE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF LUCK BUT THEIR LINE
OF ROUTETWELVE OR THIRTEEN MILES A DAY IN FINE WEATHERDROPPED
ALWAYS SOUTH AND EAST FROM ECQUES IT CROSSED THE LYS AT THROUANNE
HELD OVER THE WORN ROAD BETWEEN ST POL AND BTHUNE TILL AT
MAGNICOURTLECOMTE CAME ORDERS THAT ALL KITS WERE TO BE REDUCED
AND SENT IN TO ST POL ELABORATE REASONS WERE GIVEN FOR THIS SUCH
AS LACK OF TRANSPORT OWING TO TROOPS BEING HURRIED TO ITALY WHICH
DISSIPATED THE IDEA OF LIGHT WINES AND MACARONI ENTERTAINED BY THE
OPTIMISTS AND DECEIVED NO ONE IF THEY TURNED LEFT WHEN THEY STRUCK
THE ST POLARRAS ROAD IT WOULD NOT BE THE FRENCH WHOM THEY WERE
RELIEVING IF THEY HELD ON SOUTH IT WOULD BE THE OLD SOMME GROUND
AND THEY HELD ON SOUTH TO BEAUFORT MARCHING BY DAYLIGHT TILL THE
18TH OF OCTOBER FOUND THEM IN A CAMP OF HUTS OUTSIDE BLAIREVILLE AND
WELL IN THE ZONE OF AEROPLANE OBSERVATION THEY MOVED UNDER COVER OF
DARKNESS THAT NIGHT TO A CAMP OF TENTS AT GOMIECOURT BETWEEN WRECKED
BAPAUME AND BATTERED ARRAS

THE BARE DEVASTATED DOWNS OF THE SOMME HAD TAKEN THEM BACK AGAIN
AND THEY WERE IN THE FIFTH CORPS THIRD JULIAN BYNGS ARMY IT
WAS REVEALED AT DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ON THE NIGHT OF
THE 19TH THAT THAT ARMY WAS ON THE EVE OF ATTACK THERE WOULD BE
NO PRELIMINARY BOMBARDMENTS BUT AN OUTRUSH OF TANKS WITH A DOZEN
INFANTRY DIVISIONS ON A SIXMILE FRONT FROM GONNELIEU TO THE CANAL DU
NORD NEAR HERMIES

THE AFFAIR MIGHT BE A SURPRISE FOR AN ENEMY WHOM OUR PRESSURE ON
THE SALIENT HAD FORCED TO WITHDRAW A LARGE NUMBER OF TROOPS FROM
THE SOMME FRONT IF THE TANKS WORKED WELL IT OUGHT TO RESULT IN
THE BREAKING THROUGH OF THE TRIPLETRENCH SYSTEM OF THE HINDENBURG
LINE WHICH HAD BEEN IMMENSELY STRENGTHENED BY THE GERMANS SINCE
THEIR LEISURELY RETIREMENT THITHER IN APRIL WE MIGHT EXPECT TO
PUSH ON ACROSS THEIR RESERVE SYSTEM THREE OR FOUR MILES BEHIND THE
HINDENBURG LINE WE MIGHT EVEN CAPTURE CAMBRAI TWELVE THOUSAND YARDS
FROM OUR JUMPINGOFF PLACE THOUGH THAT WOULD BE A SIDEISSUE BUT
WITH LUCK OUR ATTACK WOULD WIN US MORE HIGH GROUND TOWARDS THE
NORTH AND THE NORTHEAST WHENCE WE COULD LATER STRIKE IN WHICHEVER
DIRECTION SEEMED MOST PROFITABLE SECRECY AND HARDHITTING WOULD
BE OF THE ESSENCE OF THE CONTRACT SINCE THE ENEMY COULD BRING UP
REINFORCEMENTS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS MEANTIME THE GUARDS DIVISION
WOULD STAND BY AT TWO HOURS NOTICE READY TO BE USED AS REQUIRED
IF CAMBRAI WERE TAKEN THEY WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO HOLD IT AND
MAKE GOOD IF IT WERE NOT THEN THE BATTLE WOULD RANK AS A RAID
ON A BIG SCALE AND THE DIVISION MIGHT BE USED FOR ANYTHING THAT
DEVELOPED THAT SAME DAY MAJOR BAGGALLAY MC CARRIED OUT A ROAD
RECONNAISSANCE OF THE FRONT AT DOIGNIES AND DEMICOURT NORTH OF
HAVRINCOURT WOOD THE SITUATION THERE BETRAYED NOTHING APPARENTLY
THE WHOLE OF THAT FRONTSECTOR WAS HABITUALLY VERY QUIET

TWENTYFOUR HOURS LATER IT WAS ALIVE AND ROARING WITH OUR TANKS
ROOTING THROUGH THE MASSED WIRE OF THE HINDENBURG LINE THE CLAMOUR
OF HALFADOZEN DIVISIONS LAUNCHED AT THEIR HEELS AND THE SMASHING
FIRE OF OUR GUNS IN ADVANCE OF THEM AND THEIR COVERING SMOKESCREENS
WHILE FAR TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH DUMMY ATTACKS GAS AND ARTILLERY
DEMONSTRATIONS VEILED AND CONFUSED EITHER FLANK THE OPENING DAY WAS
BEYOND DOUBT A SUCCESS THE GERMAN LINE WENT OUT UNDER THE TANKS
AS BREAKWATERS GO OUT UNDER THE RACE OF A TIDE AND FROM GONNELIEU
TO NORTH OF HERMIES THREE SYSTEMS OF THEIR DEFENCE WERE OVERRUN TO
A DEPTH OF FOUR OR FIVE MILES BY THE 21ST NOVEMBER OUR ATTACK HAD
PUNCHED OUT A SQUAREHEADED SALIENT TEN MILES ACROSS THE BASE THE
SOUTHERLY SIDE OF WHICH RAN ALONG THE HIGH GROUND OF THE BONAVIS
RIDGE MORE OR LESS PARALLEL TO THE ST QUENTINESCAUT CANAL FROM
GONNELIEU TO MASNIRES WHICH LATTER PLACE WE HELD THE EASTERLY
SIDE LAY FROM MASNIRES THROUGH NOYELLESSURLESCAUT AND CANTAING
TO FONTAINENOTREDAME AND BOURLON WOOD THIS LATTER AS THE HIGHEST
POINT OF COMMAND WAS THE KEY OF THE POSITION ON OUR NORTH FLANK
THENCE THE NORTHERLY FLANK OF THE SALIENT RAN ROUGHLY WESTWARD FROM
THE WOOD SOUTH OF MUVRES TILL IT JOINED OUR ORIGINAL FRONT NORTH OF
BOURSIES ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE SALIENT WAS COMMANDED BY GERMAN GUNS
FROM THE NORTH OF BOURLON WOOD AND THE OTHER HALF FROM THE SOUTH IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE BONAVIS RIDGE

BESIDES THESE NATURAL DISADVANTAGES THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS OF OUR
CAVALRY HOPEFULLY DISPOSED ON THE MAIN ROUTES IN READINESS FOR THE
TRADITIONAL BREAKTHROUGH THE HARRYING OF ENEMY COMMUNICATIONS
ETC NOVEMBER ON THE SOMME IS NOT HOWEVER QUITE THE BEST SEASON FOR
EXPLOITS OF HORSE SABRE AND LANCE

MEANTIME THE BATTALION SPENT THE 20TH NOVEMBER AND TILL THE EVENING
OF THE 21ST AT TWO HOURS NOTICE IN CAMP NEAR BARASTRE AND ON THE
23RD NOVEMBER MOVED TO BIVOUAC JUST WEST OF THE VILLAGE OF DOIGNIES
BEHIND DEMICOURT ON THE EDGE OF THE HABITUALLY VERY QUIET SECTOR
BEFORE MENTIONED THE 1ST AND 3RD BRIGADES GUARDS DIVISION HAD BEEN
DETAILED TO RELIEVE TWO BRIGADES OF THE FIFTYFIRST DIVISION IN THE
LINE ATTACKING FONTAINENOTREDAME VILLAGE AT THE EXTREME NORTH TIP
OF THE SALIENT A DOZEN MILES AWAY AND ON THE EVENING OF THE 23RD
NOVEMBER THEY RECEIVED VERBAL ORDERS TO GET AWAY FROM DOIGNIES AT
THE MOMENT THE BATTALION WAS MOVING OFF CAME WRITTEN ORDERS THAT THE
WHOLE OF ITS FIRSTLINE TRANSPORT SHOULD ACCOMPANY IT SO A VERBAL
ORDER WAS SENT TO THE TRANSPORT OFFICER TO BRING IT ON IN REAR OF THE
BRIGADE COLUMN THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF SOME NOT TOO SUCCESSFUL
STAFF WORK AND SOME UNNECESSARY WANDERINGS IN THE DARK COMPLICATED
BY THE CONGESTION OF THE ROADS AND THE PRESENCE OF THE EVERHOPEFUL
CAVALRY THE BATTALION ITS TRANSPORT ALL ABROAD CROSSED THE CANAL
DU NORD FROM DOIGNIES AND WAITED BY THE ROADSIDE TILL LIEUTCOLONEL
FOLLETT COMMANDING THE BRIGADE RODE INTO GRAINCOURT PICKED UP
GUIDES FROM THE 152ND BRIGADE BROUGHT ON THE BATTALION ANOTHER
COUPLE OF THOUSAND YARDS TO THE CROSSROADS AT LA JUSTICE FOUND
FRESH GUIDES FROM THE GORDONS AND ARGYLL AND SUTHERLAND HIGHLANDERS
AND MOVED DOWNHILL STRAIGHT INTO LINE AT CANTAING MILL AFTER A GOOD
AND QUIET RELIEF AT 320 A M ON THE MORNING OF THE 24TH FIGHTING
HAD BEEN GOING ON DAY AND NIGHT SINCE THE 20TH FOR THE POSSESSION
OF BOURLON WOOD AND VILLAGE WHERE THE FORTIETH DIVISION HAD BEEN
WORN TO A SKELETON IN ALTERNATE ATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK BUT THERE
WAS NO TROUBLE THAT DAWN OR DAY ON THE CANTAING SECTOR WHERE THE
BATTALION LAY AND LISTENED TO THE ROAR OF THE BATTLE A MILE AND A
HALF TO THE NORTH THEIR CONCERN WAS TO IMPROVE THEIR LINE AND FIND
OUT WHERE ON EARTH THE STAFF HAD LOST THEIR FIRSTLINE TRANSPORT
IT APPEARED THAT VARYING ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE TRANSPORT FOR
THE DIFFERENT BATTALIONS COMPLICATED BY GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO
FOLLOW THEIR OWN UNITS BY THE LIGHT OF NATURE AND THERE THE ORDERS
STOPPED NATURALLY AS THE ROADS BOILED WITH TRAFFIC ALL TRANSPORT
WAS PROMPTLY STOOD ASIDE TO LET TROOPS GET AHEAD WITH THE RESULT
THAT AFTER MANY ADVENTURES IN THE DARK INCLUDING THE COLLAPSE OF A
BRIDGE OVER THE CANAL DU NORD WHEN HALF THE LOADS HAD CROSSED THE
BATTALIONS TRANSPORT GOT INTO RIBECOURT AT FIVE IN THE MORNING
STILL WITHOUT ANY ORDERS FOUND THAT NO ONE KNEW WHERE BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS MIGHT BE BILLETED THEMSELVES IN A WRECKED FARM AND
MANAGED TO GET INTO TOUCH WITH THEIR BATTALION IN THE AFTERNOON OF
THE 24TH ABOUT THIS TIME THE FORTIETH DIVISION WITH THE TANKS
ATTACKED BOURLON VILLAGE CAPTURED THE WHOLE OF IT ONLY TO BE FOUGHT
OUT BY THE ENEMY ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE WOOD HAD NOT AT THAT TIME
GAINED ITS DARK NAME IN HISTORY ALL THAT THE WAITING BATTALION AT
CANTAING REPORTS ON THE 25TH NOVEMBER WHILE WOOD AND VILLAGE FUMED
LIKE THE INFERNOS THAT THEY WERE IS NO FIGHTING ON THE BATTALION
FRONT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS HEAVY FIGHTING ON THE LEFT

IT BROKE OUT AGAIN ON THE 26TH TOWARDS EVENING THE FIFTH DAY OF
CONTINUOUS BATTLE WHEN THE 4TH GRENADIERS OF THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE
WERE SENT UP TO SUPPORT THE FORTIETH DIVISION AND ON THE WAY
THITHER WENT THROUGH A HEAVY GERMAN BARRAGE AS THOUGH THEY WERE ON
PARADE

BUT THE HIGH GROUND ABOVE BOURLON WOOD AND FONTAINENOTREDAME GAVE
THE ENEMY AN ARTILLERY AND OBSERVATION COMMAND WHICH ENABLED THEM TO
SWEEP OUR FRONT AND BACK AREAS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE SALIENT
ALMOST AS THEY CHOSE PRESSURE TOO WAS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ON
THE FLANKS THE FORTYEIGHT HOURS IN WHICH THE ENEMY COULD BRING UP
FRESH TROOPS HAD GROWN TO NEARLY A WEEK AND THEY HAD USED EVERY HOUR
OF IT IN NO WAY COULD THE SITUATION BE CALLED HEALTHY BUT WERE
THE BOURLON RIDGES WON AT LEAST OUR GAIN OF GROUND MIGHT BE HELD
SO IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE 3RD GRENADIERS 1ST
COLDSTREAM 2ND IRISH GUARDS AND 1ST SCOTS GUARDS TOGETHER WITH THE
4TH GRENADIERS AND THE WELSH GUARDS BORROWED SHOULD ON THE 27TH
ATTACK FONTAINE VILLAGE AND BOURLON WOOD THEY DID SO ATTACK THEY
WERE CUT TO PIECES WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE IN THE ADVANCE THEY WERE
SHELLED OUT OF BOURLON WOOD THEY WERE COUNTERATTACKED BY HEAVY
REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ENEMY THEY HAD NO REINFORCEMENTS THEY FELL
BACK ON FONTAINE VILLAGE IN THE EVENING THEY WITHDREW FROM IT IN
THE DARKNESS AND FELL BACK ON LA JUSTICE IT WAS A FULL FAILURE
WITH HEAVY CASUALTIES AND THE NEWS WENT BACK WITH THE SPEED OF ALL
BAD NEWS TO THE 1ST BRIGADE WHICH HAD BEEN RELIEVED ON THE 26TH
THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS LYING AT RIBECOURT IN THE RUINED FARM WHERE
THEIR TRANSPORT HAD TAKEN REFUGE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRENCH
OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE BUT A BATTALION OF ANOTHER DIVISION WAS FOUND IN
POSSESSION OF IT AND SO WAS NOT DISTURBED


GOUZEAUCOURT

THERE WAS NO SHELTER AGAINST THE DRIVING SNOWY RAIN AND THE MEN
WITHOUT GREATCOATS OR BLANKETS WERE VERY COLD WET AND MISERABLE
THE NEXT DAY WAS NO BETTER AND ON THE 29TH THE FIFTYNINTH
DIVISION TOOK OVER THEIR AREA FROM THEM WHILE THE GUARDS DIVISION
WAS REARRANGED THUS THE 3RD BRIGADE AT TRESCAULT THE 2ND AT
RIBECOURT AND THE 1ST AT METZENCOUTURE A WRECKED REDBRICK
VILLAGE ONCE ENGAGED IN THE SUGARBEET INDUSTRY LYING ON AND UNDER
A SWELL OF THE DOWNS SOME FOUR THOUSAND YARDS WEST OF GOUZEAUCOURT
THE DIVISIONAL ARTILLERY WAS AT FLESQUIRES MORE THAN FOUR MILES
AWAY THE BATTALIONS MARCH TO METZ WAS BADLY DELAYED BY BLOCKS ON
THE ROAD AND A GENERAL IMPRESSION SPREAD THAT TROUBLE WAS NOT FAR
OFF INDIVIDUALLY THE SOLDIER IS EASY TO DECEIVE COLLECTIVELY A
BATTALION HAS THE SURE INSTINCT OF AN ANIMAL FOR CHANGES IN THE WIND
THERE WERE CATACOMBS IN METZ VILLAGE WHERE ONE COMPANY WAS BILLETED
WHEREBY IT WAS NEARLY CHOKED TO DEATH BY FOUL GASES8 THIS SEEMED
ALL OF A PIECE WITH THE BAD LUCK OF THE TOUR AND THE DAWN OF THE
30TH NOVEMBER WAS USHERED IN BY SINGLE SHELLS FROM A LONGRANGE GUN
WHICH FOUND THEM DURING THE NIGHT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEY HAD THE
ORDER TO MOVE TO HEUDICOURT AND HAD DIGESTED A PERSISTENT RUMOUR THAT
THE ENEMY WERE THROUGH AT GONNELIEU TELEGRAMS AND ORDERS BEGAN TO
POUR IN THE GIST OF THEM WAS THAT THE LINE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY CRACKED
AND THAT THE BRIGADE WOULD MOVE TO GOUZEAUCOURT AT ONCE BUT WHAT
THE BRIGADE WAS TO DO AND UNDER WHOSE COMMAND IT WAS TO OPERATE
WERE MATTERS ON WHICH TELEGRAMS AND ORDERS MOST LIVELILY CONFLICTED
EVENTUALLY THE DIVISION AS A WHOLE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE THIRD CORPS
THE 3RD BRIGADE WAS ORDERED TO COME UP FROM TRESCAULT AND HELP THE
1ST AND THE VARIOUS COS OF THE BATTALIONS OF THE 1ST BRIGADE RODE
FORWARD TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY HAD NOT FAR
TO GO OVER THE RIDGE BETWEEN GOUZEAUCOURT AND METZ POURED GUNNERS
CARRYING THEIR SIGHTS WITH THEM ENGINEERS HORSES AND INFANTRY ALL
APPARENTLY BENT ON GETTING INTO THE VILLAGE WHERE THEY WOULD BE A
BETTER TARGET FOR ARTILLERY THE VILLAGE CHOKED THE BATTALION FELL
IN CLEAR OF THE CONFUSION WHERE IT BEST COULD AND SET OFF AT ONCE
IN ARTILLERY FORMATION REGARDLESS OF THE STRAGGLERS INTO THE HIGH
AND BARE LANDS ROUND GOUZEAUCOURT THERE WERE NO GUNS TO BACK THEM
FOR THEIR OWN WERE AT FLESQUIRES

AS WAS POINTED OUT BY AN OBSERVER OF THAT CURIOUS DAYTIS
LITTLE YE CAN DO WITH GUNSIGHTS AN THEM IN THE ARRUMS AV MEN IN
A GREAT HASTE THERE WAS MEN WITH BLANKETS ROUND EM AN MEN WITH
LOOSE PUTTIES WAVIN IN THE WIND AND THEY TOLD US TWAS A GENERAL
RETIREMENT WE COULD SEE THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW FOR WHY THEY WAS
RETURNIN WE WENT THROUGH EM ALL FAIRLY BREASTIN OUR WAY ANDWE
FOUND JERRY ON THE NEXT SLOPE MAKIN PRISONERS OF A LABOUR CORPS
WITH PICKS AN SHOVELS BUT SOME OF THAT SAME LABOUR CORPS THEY TOOK
THEIR PICKS AN SHOVELS AND CAME ON WITH US

THEY HALTED AND FIXED BAYONETS JUST OUTSIDE GOUZEAUCOURT WOOD THE
IRISH ON THE LEFT OF THE LINE THEIR RIGHT ON THE METZGOUZEAUCOURT
ROAD THE 3RD COLDSTREAM IN THE CENTRE THE 2ND COLDSTREAM ON THE
RIGHT THE 2ND GRENADIERS IN RESERVE IN GOUZEAUCOURT WOOD ITSELF
WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE IMPRESSED MEN MOST WAS THE EXTREME NAKEDNESS
OF THE LANDSCAPE AND AT FIRST THE ABSENCE OF CASUALTIES THEY
WERE SHELLED AS THEY MARCHED TO THE WOOD BUT NOT HEAVILY BUT WHEN
THEY HAD PASSED BEYOND IT THEY CAME UNDER MACHINEGUN FIRE FROM THE
VILLAGE THEY TOPPED THE RISE BEYOND THE WOOD NEAR QUEENS CROSS AND
WERE SHELLED FROM ST QUENTIN RIDGE TO THE EAST THEY OVERRAN THE
REMNANT OF ONE OF OUR TRENCHES IN WHICH SOME SAPPERS AND INFANTRY
WERE STILL HOLDING ON DISMOUNTED CAVALRY APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE IN
PARTICULAR AS TROOPS WILL IN A MIXED FRAY AND ATTACHED THEMSELVES
TO THE RIGHT OF THE THIN LINE AS THEY SWEPT DOWN THE LAST SLOPE TO
GOUZEAUCOURT THE MACHINEGUN FIRE FROM THE VILLAGE GREW HOTTER ON
THEIR RIGHT AND THE LEADING COMPANY CHARACTERISTICALLY ENOUGH
MADE IN TOWARDS IT THIS PULLED THE BATTALION A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT
AND OFF THE ROAD WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR LEFT BOUNDARY BUT
IT INDUBITABLY HELPED TO CLEAR THE PLACE THE ENEMY WERE SEEN TO BE
LEAVING IN SOME HASTE AND ONLY A FEW OF THEM WERE SHOT OR BAYONETED
IN AND OUT AMONG THE HOUSES THE BATTALION PUSHED IN THROUGH THE
VILLAGE TO THE SLOPE EAST OF IT UNDER QUENTIN MILL WHERE THEY
DUG IN FOR THE NIGHT THEIR LEFT FLANK WAS ALL IN THE AIR FOR A
WHILE BUT THE 3RD BRIGADE WHICH HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY ORDERED TO
COME UP ON THE RIGHT OF THE 1ST WAS DIVERTED TO THE LEFT ON THE
GOUZEAUCOURTVILLERSPLOUICH LINE AND THEY GOT INTO TOUCH WITH THE
4TH GRENADIERS THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO COUNTERATTACK TANKS WERE
USED ON THE RIGHT DURING THE ACTION BUT THEY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE
PLAYED ANY MATERIAL PART IN THE BATTALIONS AREA AND AS THE LIGHT
OF THE SHORT AND FREEZING NOVEMBER DAY CLOSED A CAVALRY REGIMENT OR
SOME CAVALRY CAME UP ON THE LEFT FLANK

THE ACTUAL STROKE THAT RECOVERED GOUZEAUCOURT HAD NOT TAKEN MORE THAN
AN HOUR BUT THE DAY HAD COST THEM A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEN KILLED
WOUNDED AND MISSING LIEUTENANT N F DURANT KILLED LIEUTENANT
ACTING CAPTAIN JOYCE LIEUTENANT G E F VAN DER NOOT LIEUTENANT
G K THOMPSON MC AND 2ND LIEUTENANT P M RILEY WOUNDED ALL THE
CASUALTIES WERE FROM MACHINEGUN FIRE MEN DROPPING AT THE CORNERS OF
STREETS ACROSS THRESHOLDS IN CELLARS AND IN THE ANGLES OF WRECKED
WALLS THAT FALLING ON THEM HID THEM FOR EVER

A PROFANE LEGEND SPRANG UP ALMOST AT ONCE THAT THE ZEAL SHOWN BY THE
GUARDS IN THE ATTACK WAS BECAUSE THEY KNEW GOUZEAUCOURT HELD THE
SUPPLIES OF THE DIVISION WHICH HAD EVACUATED IT THE ENEMY HAD BEEN
TURNED OUT BEFORE HE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS OCCUPATION INDEED
A COUPLE OF OUR SUPPLYTRAINS WERE FOUND UNTOUCHED ON RAIL AT THE
STATION AND A NUMBER OF OUR GUNS WERE RECAPTURED IN AND AROUND THE
PLACE ALSO THE DIVISIONAL RUMSUPPLY WAS LARGELY INTACT WHEN THIS
FACT CAME TO LIGHT AS IT DIDSO TO SAYRUMJAR BY RUMJAR BORNE
JOYOUSLY THROUGH THE DARK STREETS THAT BITTER NIGHT THE BRIGADE
WAS REFRESHED AND WARMED AND MEN ASSERT FELT ALMOST GRATEFUL TO
THE DIVISION WHICH HAD LAID THIS EXTRA FATIGUE ON THEM ONE GRIM
INCIDENT STAYS IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVEDTHE SIGHT OF AN
ENORMOUS IRISHMAN URGING TWO CAPTIVES WHOM HE HAD HIMSELF UNEARTHED
FROM A CELLAR TO DANCE BEFORE HIM HE DEMANDED THE JIGS OF HIS
NATIVE LAND AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT BY GIVING THEM DRINK HIS PUPILS
WOULD BECOME PROFICIENT MEN STOOD ABOUT AND LAUGHED TILL THEY COULD
HARDLY STAND AND WHEN THE FUN WAS AT ITS HEIGHT A CHANCE SHELL OUT
OF THE DARKNESS TO THE EASTWARD WIPED OUT ALL THAT TANGOCLASS BEFORE
THEIR EYES TWAS LIKE A DHREAM YELL UNDERSTAND ONE MINUTE
BOTH JERRIES WAS DANCIN HARD TO OBLIGE HIM AN THENNOTHIN
NOTHINNOTHINOF THE THREE OF THEM

THE NEXT DAY ORDERS CAME FOR THE GUARDS DIVISION TO CONTINUE THEIR
WORK AND ATTACK ON A FRONT OF TWO MILES ALONG THE LINE OF THE RIDGE
A THOUSAND YARDS EAST OF GOUZEAUCOURT WHICH RAN SOUTH THROUGH
GONNELIEU VILLAGE AND GAUCHE WOOD TO VILLERS HILL TANKS THEY
WERE TOLD WOULD HELP AND THE DIVISIONAL ARTILLERY WOULD PUT DOWN
BARRAGES THE FIFTYNINTH DIVISION WOULD BE ON THEIR LEFT AND THE
CAVALRY DIVISION ON THEIR RIGHT THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE WERE ASSIGNED
GAUCHE WOOD THE 3RD BRIGADE HAD THE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF
RUSHING GONNELIEU VILLAGE IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER DIVISION WHO WERE
ATTACKING IT THAT MORNING 1ST DECEMBER FAILING TO MAKE HEADWAY
THE 1ST BRIGADES ATTACK ON GAUCHE WOOD WAS UNDERTAKEN BY THE 2ND
GRENADIERS ON THE RIGHT THE 3RD COLDSTREAM IN RESERVE IN THEIR
TRENCHES THEY ASSEMBLED BEFORE DAWN ON THE 1ST DECEMBER WAITED A
WHILE FOR A PROMISED DETACHMENT OF TANKS AND FINALLY STARTED OFF
WITHOUT THEM THEIR ARTILLERY SUPPORT WAS MEAGRE AND THE TROOPS HAD
TO COVER THREEQUARTERS OF A MILE OVER GRASSY LAND TO THE FRINGE
OF THE WOOD THE ENEMYS FIRST BARRAGE FELL BEHIND THEM THE WOOD
ITSELF WAS CRAMMED WITH MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE MACHINEGUNS BUT ONCE
IT HAD BEEN ENTERED THE ISSUE BECAME A MANTOMAN AFFAIR THEN
SOME TANKS TURNED UP AND SOME CAVALRY THE LATTER AN HOUR LATE THE
TANKS WERE EVENTUALLY WITHDRAWN AS THEY FOUND NO TRENCHES TO CRUSH
IN THE WOOD AND DREW MUCH SHELLFIRE IN THE OPEN BUT THE CAVALRY
WHICH INCLUDED BENGAL LANCERS WERE OF GOOD USE ON THE RIGHT FLANK
OF THE ATTACK THE TWO GUARDS BRIGADES ONE ATTACKING GONNELIEU TO
THE NORTH THE OTHER GAUCHE WOOD TO THE SOUTH DREW A LITTLE APART
FROM EACH OTHER AS THE MEN CLOSED IN WHERE THE MACHINEGUN FIRE
WAS HOTTEST AND ABOUT NINE OCLOCK THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS SENT UP A
COMPANY NO 1 TO FILL THE GAP WHICH DEVELOPED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
GOUZEAUCOURTGONNELIEU ROAD THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE BRIGADES

THEY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DO MORE THAN SIT SUFFER
AND BE SHELLED TILL EVENING WHEN THEY WERE RELIEVED BY A COMPANY OF
THE 1ST COLDSTREAM AND WENT BACK IN THE HARD BLACK FROST TO THEIR
BIVOUAC IN GOUZEAUCOURT WOOD GAUCHE WOOD WAS WON AND HELD BUT
GONNELIEU ITS HOUSES AND CELLARAGES CRAMMED WITH MACHINEGUNS WAS
A HOPELESS PROPOSITION FROM THE FIRST TO TROOPS LACKING TANKS OR
ADEQUATE ARTILLERY AID THE SOLE EXCUSE FOR ATTEMPTING IT WAS THAT
THE ENEMYS PRESSURE WAS HEAVY AND INCREASING ON ALL THREE SIDES OF
THE CAMBRAI SALIENT BOURLON WOOD IN THE NORTH WAS THE POINT OF MOST
ACTUAL DANGER AND HAD TO BE MET BY WHATEVER OFFERED AT THE TIMES
AND NEAR THE PLACES THE 3RD BRIGADE WAS HELD UP BY THE INEVITABLE
MACHINEGUN IN TRENCHES IN FRONT OF GONNELIEU AND ROUND THE CEMETERY
ON ITS EASTERN OUTSKIRTS AND THERE IT STAYED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF
EXTREME MISERY TILL THE 3RD DECEMBER WHEN THE 1ST BRIGADE CAME BACK
FROM GOUZEAUCOURT WOOD TO RELIEVE THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS NUMBERING
THEN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY BATTLESTRENGTH WHO TOOK OVER THE
2ND SCOTS GUARDS AND HALF THE 1ST GRENADIERS LINE WERE ALLOTTED
WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED MIXED SAMPLES OF TRENCH NO 1 COMPANY FOR
INSTANCE HELD SIX HUNDRED YARDS OF SUPERIOR WIRED LINE EVIDENTLY
AN OLD BRITISH RESERVE LINE WITH THE ENEMY DUG IN SIXTY YARDS AWAY
NO 3 COMPANY ON ITS RIGHT HAD A SECTION MOSTLY BATTERED TO BITS AND
FURTHER WEAKENED BY AN OLD COMMUNICATIONTRENCH RUNNING UP TO THE
ENEMY WHICH HAD TO BE BLOCKED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE NO 2 COMPANY
WAS EVEN LESS HAPPILY PLACED FOR THE ENEMY INHABITED THE ACTUAL
CONTINUATION OF THEIR TRENCH SO THAT THEY WORKED WITH THEIR RIGHT
FLANK GROSSLY EXPOSED TWO PLATOONS OF NO 4 COMPANY LAY CLOSE BEHIND
NO 2 TO COVER A GAP WHILE THE OTHER TWO PLATOONS IN FLAG RAVINE
FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED YARDS BACK BY THE RAILWAYLINE WERE ALL THE
RESERVE THE BATTALION POSSESSED EAST OF GOUZEAUCOURT WOOD BY SOME
UNEXPLAINED MERCY OF PROVIDENCE THAT NIGHT THE NEXT DAY AND THE
NEXT DAYS NIGHT WERE QUIET IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS NO ACTUAL
ATTACK THE MEN SAT IN THE TRENCHES AND FROZE FOR THE FROST HELD
DAY AND NIGHT AND THE ENEMY SHELLED THE LINE AT THEIR WILL WITH
TRENCHMORTARS FROM NEAR AT HAND AND HEAVIER STUFF FROM THE RIDGES
BEYOND JUST BEFORE DAWN ON THE 5TH DECEMBER THEY PUT DOWN A VERY
HEAVY MIXED BARRAGE BEHIND THE FRONT LINE AND A TRENCHMORTAR ONE
ON THE LINE ITSELF AND THEN ATTACKED THE TWO WEAK SPOTSNO 2 AND
NO 3 COMPANYS POSITIONWITH ARMOURED BOMBERS THE BARRICADE TO
THE COMMUNICATIONTRENCH OF NO 3 COMPANY WAS BLOWN IN BY A DIRECT
MORTARHIT AND A RUSH FOLLOWED NO 2 COMPANYS TRENCH WAS ALSO
RUSHED ENDON FROM THE RIGHT AND THREE OR FOUR BAYS OF IT WERE
TAKEN AT THIS POINT THE IRISH LEFT THE TRENCHES ALL FILLING WITH
THE ENEMY GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN WHERE FOR THE MOMENT THERE WAS
NO MORTARFIRE AND DEALT WITH THE INVADERS FROM OUTSIDE BOMBING
AND SHOOTING DOWNWARDS INTO THE HEAVILYMOVING QUEUES THE GERMANS
WORE THEIR PACKS FROM WHICH IT MAY BE INFERRED SAYS THE DIARY
DELICATELY THAT THEY MEANT TO OCCUPY OUR TRENCHES THIS AND
THEIR SCIENTIFIC ARMOUR PROVED THEIR UNDOING AND WHENPRESUMABLY
TO MAKE DOUBLY SUREAN INFANTRY ATTACK SWARMED OUT IN TWO LINES
FROM GONNELIEU IT WAS BROKEN UP BY OUR RIFLE AND MACHINEGUN FIRE
TILL IT TURNED ROUND AND FLED HEREUPON SAYS THE DIARY THEY WERE
HEAVILY BOMBED BY THEIR OWN SIDE PRESUMABLY AS AN EXAMPLE TO HIS
MAJESTYS GUARDS OF PRUSSIAN DISCIPLINE THE CASUALTIES IN THE
BATTALION WERE ONE OFFICER 2ND LIEUTENANT CAREY AND FOUR OTHER
RANKS KILLED AND ABOUT THIRTY WOUNDED MAINLY BY BOMBS AND MORTARS
BUT THE AFFAIR WAS WASTEWORK ON BOTH SIDES FOR GONNELIEU WAS NEVER
TAKEN BY OUR ARMS OUR LINE HERE IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO FELL BACK
ON GAUCHE WOOD AND OF ALL THE SALIENT WON AT THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI
BETWEEN THE 20TH AND THE 23RD OF NOVEMBER ALL THAT REMAINED BY
THE 7TH OF DECEMBER WAS A STRETCH OF COUNTRY PERHAPS FOUR THOUSAND
YARDS DEEP RUNNING FROM THE GOUZEAUCOURTCAMBRAI ROAD TO NORTH OF
DEMICOURT ON THE OTHER HAND A CANTLE HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF OUR
OLD FRONT LINE FROM OPPOSITE VENDHUILLE TO GONNELIEU BUT IN THE
AREA THAT WE HELD LAY A SAMPLE OF THE GREAT HINDENBURG LINE WITH
ITS SUPPORTSYSTEMS ITS TENFOOTDEEP CONCRETED AND CAMOUFLAGED
TRENCHES COVERED GUNWAYS MACHINEGUN WELLS AND SHAFTS AND THE
WHOLE DETAIL OF ITS IMMENSELY ADVERTISED IMPREGNABILITY MEN SAW IT
WITH THEIR OWN EYES EXPLORED ITS RECESSES WONDERINGLY FOLLOWED DOWN
THE TERRIBLE LANES THAT THE TANKS HAD CUT IN ITS HUNDREDYARDDEEP
BELTINGS OF WIRE AND SETTLED THEMSELVES THANKFULLY IN ITS SECURE
DUGOUTS NOT FORESEEING THE DAYS NEXT SPRING WHEN THEY WOULD BE
SWEPT OUT OF IT ALL LIKE WITHERED LEAVES CAMBRAI WAS NO SUCCESS BUT
IT WOULD BE UNJUST TO HOLD IT AS SOME WEARIED AND OVERWROUGHT SOULS
DID AN UNRELIEVED FAILURE THE ENEMY HAD NOT ACHIEVED THEIR PURPOSE
WHICH WAS TO CUT OFF ALL OUR TROOPS IN THE SALIENT AND WERE QUITE
WILLING TO BREAK AWAY AND WAIT TILL THE TRANSFER OF FRESH DIVISIONS
FROM THE COLLAPSED RUSSIAN FRONT SHOULD BE METHODICALLY COMPLETED
WE ON OUR PART WERE EQUALLY READY TO CUT OUR LOSSES FOR WE HAD NO
MEN TO SPARE THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS MOVED OUT OF THE BATTLEAREA
ON THE 6TH DECEMBER BEING RELIEVED BY TROOPS OF THE NINTH DIVISION
ON THE EVENING OF THEIR OWN PRIVATE BATTLE THE BATTALION HANDED OVER
THEIR NONE TOO PLEASANT TRENCHES TO THE 5TH CAMERON HIGHLANDERS AND
WENT BACK TO BIVOUAC IN GOUZEAUCOURT WOOD AFTER A VERY GOOD RELIEF
WHICH DREW FROM THE DIARY THE TRIBUTE THAT THE CAMERONS WERE A FINE
BATTALION HAD THEY BEEN AN HOUR LATE IN THAT CUTTING WIND ACROSS
THE SLOPES A COHORT OF ANGELS WITH FIERY SWORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT
DOWN AS HOPELESS

THEY MOVED FROM THE WOOD NEXT DAY TO ETRICOURT DOWN THE LONG ROAD
THROUGH FINS AND AT ETRICOURT ENTRAINED FOR BEAUMETZLESLOGES ON
THE ARRASDOULLENS ROAD WHICH THEY REACHED LATE AT NIGHT COLD AND
EMPTY AND WERE NOT BILLETED AT BERNEVILLE TWO OR THREE KILOMETRES
TO THE NORTHEAST TILL MIDNIGHT THEY HAD LOST IN NOVEMBER AND
DECEMBER TWO OFFICERS KILLED LIEUTENANT N F DURANT ON THE 30TH
NOVEMBER WHO HAD JOINED ON THE 1ST OF THAT MONTH AND 2ND LIEUTENANT
T A CAREY KILLED ON THE 5TH DECEMBER JOINED ON THE 24TH OCTOBER
THE AVERAGE EXPECTATION OF AN OFFICERS LIFE IN THOSE DAYS ON THE
SOMME WAS STILL ABOUT SIX WEEKS THOUGH SOME WERE SO LUCKY THEY
SURVIVED FOR MONTHS FOUR OFFICERS HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN THE SAME
PERIOD LIEUTENANTS G K THOMPSON LIEUTENANT ACTING CAPTAIN
JOYCE G E F VAN DER NOOT AND 2ND LIEUTENANT P M RILEY ALL
ON THE 30TH NOVEMBER THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS JOINED IN NOVEMBER AND
DECEMBER LIEUTENANTS ZIGOMALA B F CREWDSON D J B FITZGERALD
AND J N WARD AND 2ND LIEUTENANTS H A A COLLETT A W G
JAMRACK AND C A J NICHOLSON

AT BEAUMETZLESLOGES THEY LAY TILL THE END OF THE YEAR CLEANING
UP REFITTING DRILLING AND NOT FORGETTING THEIR FOOTBALLTHE
2ND SCOTS GUARDS BEAT THEM IN THE THIRD ROUND OF THE DIVISIONAL
FOOTBALL COMPETITION AT ARRASOR THEIR COMPANY CHRISTMAS DINNERS
THESE WERE THE FOURTH THAT THE BATTALION HAD EATEN WITHIN SOUND OF
THE WEARY GUNS BUT IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEIR NEXT WOULD
BE CELEBRATED IN STATELY STEAMHEATED BARRACKS AT COLOGNE HOSPITAL
WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS PORTION THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CALLED HAPPY
OR HOPEFUL AT THAT TIME FOR THEY KNEW AS ALL OUR ARMIES DID THAT
THE YEARS GAIN HAD BEEN SMALL AND THE WORK AHEAD OF THEM NOW THAT
THE GERMAN DIVISIONS RELEASED FROM RUSSIA WERE POURING WESTWARD
WOULD BE HEAVY BUT FOR THE MOMENT THEY WERE FREE OF THE SOMME AND
ITS INTERMINABLE DUCKBOARDS THAT LED MEN TO DEATH OR HARD WORK ITS
SHELLHOLES FLOORED WITH ICY SNOWWATER THE GRAVELIKE CHILL OF ITS
CHALK TRENCHES AND THE LIFESAPPING DAMPS OF THE UPLANDS ON WHICH
THEY HAD LAIN OUT FROM NIGHTS TILL MORNINGS

1918

ARRAS TO THE ARMISTICE


THE LULL LASTED TILL THE 2ND OF JANUARY WHEN THEY MARCHED VIA
WARLUS TO ARRAS AND WERE BILLETED IN THE PRISON THERE BATTALION
HEADQUARTERS WERE IN A LUXURIOUS HOUSE IN THE RUE DAMIENS WITH A
WHOLE ROOF AND ALL WINDOWS REPAIRED WITH CANVAS IT WAS HARD FROSTY
WEATHER BINDING EVERYTHING TIGHTOF THE KIND THAT MUST BE PAID FOR
WHEN THAW COMES

AT THAT MOMENT OUR LINE ON THE SOMME SIDE RAN FROM LENS JUST BEHIND
OPPY THROUGH RUX FIVE MILES EAST OF ARRAS SOUTH TO BULLECOURT
SOUTHEASTERLY TOWARDS BOURSIES ROUND THE FLESQUIRESRIBECOURT
SALIENT THAT CAMBRAI FIGHT HAD WON FOR US CURVED BACK BETWEEN
GONNELIEU AND GOUZEAUCOURT AND THENCE DROPPED SKIRTING ST QUENTIN
AND THE VALLEY OF THE OISE TO THE JUNCTION WITH THE FRENCH AT
BARISIS SOUTH OF THAT RIVER THIS LENGTH OF CLOSE ON SEVENTY MILES
WAS HELD FROM BARISIS TO GOUZEAUCOURT BY BYNGS THIRD ARMY AND
FROM GOUZEAUCOURT TO GAVRELLE BY GOUGHS FIFTH ARMY NORTH OF THIS
THE FIRST ARMY TOOK ON THE WORKING AND RESERVE STRENGTH OF THE THIRD
AND FIFTH ARMIES AT THE OPENING OF 1918 WAS TWENTYNINE INFANTRY
AND THREE CAVALRY DIVISIONS SO FAR AS OUR ARMS WERE CONCERNED
EVERYTHING ON THE FRENCH AND BELGIAN FRONTS WAS AT A STANDSTILL
THE SOMME HAD COST VERY HEAVILY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND THERE WAS
OR WAS SAID TO BE A SCARCITY OF MEN THE SITUATION APPEARS TO HAVE
BEEN MET BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BATTALIONS IN THE BRIGADES FROM
FOUR TO THREE APIECE THIS RELEASED THE ODD BATTALIONS TO MAKE WHAT
ON PAPER AND IN THE JOURNALS LOOKED LIKE ADDITIONAL BRIGADES BUT
THREW EXTRA WORK WHICH NOWHERE APPEARED AS NEWS ON THE WHOLE OF
THE ARMY ADMINISTRATION IN THE FIELD SIR DOUGLAS HAIGS DESPATCHES
REFER GUARDEDLY TO THE REORGANIZATION WHICH HE HINTS TO SOME
EXTENT AFFECTED THE FIGHTING EFFICIENCY OF THE UNITS CONCERNED THE
SENTIMENTS OF COMMANDERS MORE DIRECTLY CONCERNED WERE PERHAPS LESS
PUBLISHABLE FOR IT RARELY IMPROVES AN OLD ARMY IN THE FIELD TO LACE
IT AT THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE A GENERAL ATTACK WITH NEW BRIGADES
COMPOSED OF BATTALIONS SUDDENLY DISASSOCIATED FROM THE UNITS WITH
WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING BUT THUS WAS CREATED THE FOURTH GUARDS
BRIGADE BY LOPPING OFF THE 4TH GRENADIERS THE 2ND IRISH GUARDS
AND THE 3RD COLDSTREAM FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BRIGADES AND ATTACHING
THEM TO THE THIRTYFIRST DIVISION FURTHER IT WAS NECESSARY FOR
THE BRITISH ARMIES TO TAKE OVER ANOTHER STRETCH OF NEARLY THIRTY
MILES FROM THE FRENCH ON THE RIGHTAPPROXIMATELY FROM BARISIS TO
VENDHUILLE ON THE OISEAND THIS BROUGHT THE BRITISH FRONT UP TO ONE
HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE MILES TOTAL LENGTH

OUR ENEMY LAY LESS UNDER SUCH BURDENS HIS RELEASED DIVISIONS
AEROPLANES AND GUNS WERE DECENTLY ENTRAINING FROM THE RUSSIAN FRONT
AND ARRIVING ON THE SOMME IN GOOD ORDER A FACT OF WHICH OUR STAFF
AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME ALL OUR ARMIES WERE PERFECTLY AWARE WE
COULD FEEL JERRY PILIN UP AND PILIN UP AGAINST US IN THOSE DAYS
YELL UNDERSTAND SO AS MAY HAVE BEEN POINTED OUT EVERY ONE
STOOD BY TO PREPARE FOR THE WORST THE GUARDS DIVISION NOW OF NINE
BATTALIONS INSTEAD OF TWELVE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE DEFENCES BEFORE
ARRAS THE HINGE ON WHICH THE COMING TROUBLE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO
TURN THEIR TRENCH AND POST SYSTEM RAN NORTH AND SOUTH ACROSS THE
SCARPE WITH ITS LAGOON AND MARSHES BY RUXALL OLD AND MUCH USED
GROUND BUT WHICH HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING SERVED BOTH BY CANAL AND
A LIGHT RAIL FROM ARRAS

THE BATTALION WHICH HAD TRAINED AND BOMBED IN THE TOWN TILL THE
8TH JANUARY RELIEVED THE 3RD GRENADIERS IN THE RESERVE TRENCHES OF
THE RIGHT SUBSECTOR OF THIS DEFENCE ON THE 9TH JANUARY IN HEAVY
SNOW LANCER AVENUE WHICH COMMANDED A FINE VIEW OF OUR OWN LINES
AND THE ENEMYS AND POSTS K L AND M JUST OFF IT ALL SOUTH OF THE
RIVER TOOK HALF THE STRENGTH THE REMAINDER GARRISONED CRUMP AND
CORDITE RESERVE TRENCHES ON THE NORTH AND SUPPLIED AN ISOLATED AND
UNPLEASANT POST F BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE LAGOON WHICH COULD ONLY
BE REACHED WITH COMFORT AFTER DARK WHEN AN OFFICER TWENTY MEN
A LEWISGUN AND A COUPLE OF SIGNALLERS WATCHED THERE IN CASE AN
ENTERPRISING ENEMY SHOULD BE MINDED TO RAID ALONG THE TOWPATH

NEXT DAY IT THAWED AND THE OLD HORRORS OF YPRES SALIENT WERE THEIR
PORTION THE SNOW VANISHED LEAVING TERRIBLE MUD THE DAY PASSED
QUIETLY NOS 1 AND 3 COMPANIES HAD TO FIND A CARRYINGPARTY FOR
FRONT COMPANIES IN THE EVENING THE STORY BEHIND THE ENTRY TELLS
ITSELF THE ENEMY DID NOT ADD HIMSELF TO THEIR BURDENS A PATROL
UNDER 2ND LIEUTENANT H A COLLETT WENT OUT THE NEXT NIGHT JANUARY
11 FIVE HUNDRED YARDS INTO NO MANS LANDFROM F POSTSAW AND HEARD
NOTHING F POST WAS ALWAYS A GHOSTLY SORT OF PLACE WHERE BULLETS
WHISTLED BY WITHOUT EXPLANATION BETWEEN THE FURRED TREETRUNKS
ALONG THE TOWPATH AND THE MARSHY GROUND BEHIND IT WAS FILLED WITH
SHELLHOLES RUSTY WIRE AND THE BLACK DEAD OF FORGOTTEN FIGHTS
THE RUINS OF RUX ACROSS THE RIVER SUDDENLY LEAPING TO SHAPE IN
THE FLARE OF VRY LIGHTS LOOKED DOWN ON IT LIKE THE SKELETON OF
A FORTRESS ON A STAGE AND SINGLE UNEXPECTED SHELLS SPATTERED MUD
ACROSS THE COLD WATERS

ON THE 13TH JANUARY THEY RELIEVED THE 2ND GRENADIERS AT THE FRONT
IN A FRESH ASSORTMENT OF DECAYED POSTSSCABBARD ALLEY SCABBARD
SUPPORT WELFORD RESERVE AND THE LIKE WHOSE NAMES EVEN TO THIS DAY
MAKE MEN WHO SERVED THERE SHIVER AS THAW AND RAIN WORKED ON THEM
THE TRENCHES ALL FELL IN GREAT LUMPS

WHY TROOPS WHO HAD HELD THEM ALL THE SUMMER HAD DONE NOTHING TO
REVET THEM AND PREPARE FOR THE WINTER I CANNOT THINK ONE INDIGNANT
SUFFERER WROTE BUT THAT IS ALWAYS THE FAULT OF THE BRITISH ARMY
IT WILL NOT LOOK AHEAD HE PROPHESIED BETTER THAN HE KNEW THEN
HE WENT TO VISIT HIS POSTS WHERE THE MEN WERE ALREADY HALF BURIED
IN MUD THE ENEMY ASSISTED OUR REPAIRING PARTIES WITH TRENCHMORTARS
AT INTERVALS TILL ORDERS WENT FORTH THAT THOUGH OUR MORTARS WERE
NOWISE TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHEN ONCE IT BEGAN THEY WOULD RETALIATE
FOR JUST FIVE MINUTES LONGER THAN THE ENEMY BY THE MISFORTUNE OF A
FAULTY SHELL ONE OF OUR STOKES GUNS BURST ON THE 14TH KILLING OR
WOUNDING EIGHT MEN HOWEVER IT WAS NOTED THAT THE ENEMY TRANSFERRED
HIS ATTENTIONS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO A BATTALION OF EAST
LANCASHIRES ON OUR RIGHT

ON THE 15TH ALL WIRING AND DEFENCEWORK CEASEDEMPLOYED SOLELY ON
TRYING TO KEEP TRENCHES PASSABLE IN SPITE OF WHICH THE MUD GAINED
MENS BOOTS WERE PULLED OFF THEIR FEET AND IT IS ON JOYOUS RECORD
THAT WHEN CAPTAIN GORDON THE ADJUTANT TRIED TO GET UP JOHNSON
AVENUE THEIR ONLY COMMUNICATIONTRENCH HE STUCK UP TO HIS WAIST
IN MUD AND WATER AND LEST HE SHOULD BE ENGULFED HAD TO WRIGGLE
OUT OF HIS GUMBOOTS WHICH CAME UP TO HIS THIGHS AND CONTINUE IN
HIS SOCKS THE GUMBOOTS EMPTY SANK OUT OF SIGHT LIKE A WRECK ON
THE GOODWINS THEY RECONNOITRED NEW TRACKS FOR THE RELIEFS ACROSS
DUCKBOARDS RUNNING IN FULL VIEW OF THE ENEMY WHO LUCKILY HAD THEIR
OWN CONDITIONS TO FIGHT AND LET A COUPLE OF OUR PATROLS INVADE NO
MANS LAND UNMOLESTED PROWL ROUND TWO MACHINEGUN POSTS AND EVEN
ENTER A GERMAN FRONT LINE BEING TOO BUSY TALKING AND HAMMERING TO
NOTICE US THE SODDEN SANDBAGS OF THE REVETMENTS BULGED OUTWARDS
AND MET ACROSS THE TRENCHES THE MEN WORKED DAY AND NIGHT AND
BLESSED EVERY BATTALIONS REMOTEST ANCESTRY THAT HAD EVER USED AND
NEGLECTED THAT ACCURSED LINE

ON THE 17TH JANUARY THEY WERE RELIEVED BY THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHICH
MERELY MEANT THEIR REVERTING TO CRUMP TRENCH CORDITE RESERVE CEYLON
AVENUE ETC WHERE ALL BEING EQUALLY IMPASSABLE EVERY MOVEMENT HAD
TO BE EFFECTED IN THE OPEN

OUR ARTILLERY CHOSE THE 18TH TO BE VERY ACTIVE FROM THEIR POSITIONS
ROUND BATTALION HEADQUARTERS NEAR THE RAILWAY CUTTING BEHIND
WHEREBY THERE WAS SOME ENEMY RETALIATION THAT THE MIRED FRONT LINE
COULD HAVE SPARED EVERY ONE IS LOOKING LIKE THE WORST FORM OF
TRAMPSTANDING WALKING SLEEPING AND EATING MUD

ON THE 19TH THEY GOT IT WORSE AND WHEN NO 1 COMPANY PARADED IN THE
DAWN DARK THEY WERE IN DUGOUTS BELOW THE RAIL EMBANKMENT TO GO
TO WORK A SHELL WHICH DROPPED AT THE ENTRANCE KILLED ONE BUT HE
WAS THE COOK WOUNDED TWO OF THEIR NUMBER AND DESTROYED THE WHOLE
COOKINGOUTFIT CAPTAIN A F L GORDON MC WAS ALSO SLIGHTLY
WOUNDED ON THAT DATE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SEND HIM TO HOSPITAL HE WAS
RIDING INTO ARRAS WITH CAPTAIN WOODHOUSE THE MOALSO A MAN OF
CHARMED LIVESAND JUST BEHIND THE RAILWAY EMBANKMENT CAME IN FOR A
COMPLETE BARRAGE OF HEAVY STUFF INTENDED FOR BATTALION HEADQUARTERS
NEITHER HE NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY WERE NOT BLOWN
TO PIECES THE DOCTORS HORSE WOUNDED WAS THE ONLY OTHER CASUALTY

ON THE 22ND JANUARY THE RELIEVED 2ND GRENADIERS HAVING HANDED OVER
NEWS OF THE DISCOVERY OF A GERMAN LISTENINGPOST WHICH SEEMED TO
BE USED ONLY BY NIGHT A SCHEME WAS ARRANGED TO OCCUPY IT WHILE IT
WAS EMPTY AND ASTONISH THE ENEMY ON THEIR RETURN BUT THE ENEMY
NEVER CAME THOUGH 2ND LIEUTENANT STACPOOLE AND A PARTY OF SEVEN
WITH BLACKENED FACES AND SMOKED BAYONETS LAY OUT FOR THEM ALL
NIGHT IT WAS THE SAME WITH A GERMAN WORKINGPARTY FIFTY STRONG
LOCATED BY OUR PATROLS ON THE 22ND SOUGHT ON THE 23RD AND FOUND
MISSING THE ENEMY WERE ANXIOUS NOT TO GIVE ANY CHANCES JUST THEN
FOR IDENTIFICATIONS AND THOUGH THEY RAIDED GENEROUSLY IN OTHER
DIRECTIONS LEFT THE GUARDS SECTOR BY THE SCARPE UNVISITED THEY
DELIVERED MORTAR BOMBARDMENTS WHEN RELIEFS WERE DUE AND WERE
ATTENDED TO BY OUR ARTILLERY AT DUSK WITH A DESULTORY BUT AT THE
SAME TIME STEADY SHELLING JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP THE FIVE PRINCIPAL
OFFENDERS CREWS IN THEIR DUGOUTS IT WORKED ADMIRABLY AND THE
ENEMY MORTARS AS REGISTERED ON THE MAPS WERE QUIET FOR A WHOLE
EVENING AFTER ONE SUCH TREATMENT THE NIGHT OF THE 25TH JANUARY
THEY DRENCHED THE DECAUVILLE RAILWAY JUST WHEN THE BATTALION HAD
RAILED BACK TO ARRAS ON RELIEF BY THE 1ST GRENADIERS WITH AN HOURS
INTENSE BARRAGE OF GASSHELLS AND A SPRINKLING OF 59S AND 42S
BATTALION HEADQUARTERS WERE WAITING TO FOLLOW AND ALL THE MEN HAD
BEEN SENT DOWN THE LINE BECAUSE RAILHEAD WAS NO HEALTHY PLACE TO
LINGER AT A COMPANY OF THE 2ND GRENADIERS NEWLY RELIEVED CAME UP
AND ALSO WAITED FOR THE LITTLE TRAIN IN THE STILL MOONLIGHT NIGHT
AND DRANK HOT TEA WHILE A SPARE ENGINE WAS BEING COUPLED UP EVERY
ONE THOUGHT INEVITABLE PRELUDE TO CALAMITY THAT AFTER SIXTEEN
DAYS IN THE TRENCHES HIS TROUBLES WERE OVER THEN A GASSHELL
SKIMMED OVER THE LINE WHICH AT THIS POINT HAD A CUTTING ON ONE SIDE
AND AN EMBANKMENT ON THE OTHER ALL HANDS FLED TO THE EMBANKMENT
SIDE AND HUGGED IT FOR PRECISELY ONE HOUR WHILE THE AIR SCREAMED TO
THE CURIOUS WHIPLASHLIKE NOISE OF THE GASSHELLS SPLINTERING AND
FILLED WITH THE FUMES OF THEM THE ENGINE BOLTED DOWN THE LINE BEFORE
IT SHOULD BE BLOWN UP AND WHEN ON THE STROKE OF TEN SHELLING
CEASED BATTALION HEADQUARTERS FATHER BROWNE AND THE DOCTOR CAPTAIN
WOODHOUSE AND THE GRENADIERS COMPANY STUMBLED AS BEST THEY COULD
ALONG THE SLEEPERS TOWARDS ARRAS EVERY ONE MISSED EVERY ONE ELSE IN
THE CONFUSION WHILE THE IRISH ORDERLIES RAGED THROUGH THE CROWD LIKE
ANGRY NURSES IN SEARCH OF THEIR OFFICERS BUT AT LAST ALL HANDS WERE
ACCOUNTED FOR BLIND COUGHING AND THANKS TO THE NOSECLIPS OF THE
MASKS MOSTLY WITH SORE NOSES THEY GOT INTO ARRAS AT MIDNIGHT AND
A GOOD MANY OF THE GRENADIERS HAD TO BE SENT DOWN FOR GAS INJURIES

THE MONTH CLOSED WITH THE BATTALION NOMINALLY AT ARRAS AND ACTUALLY
FINDING MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ITS STRENGTH FOR WORKINGPARTIES IN
THE FILTHY FRONT LINEA FAVOUR WHICH IT HAD NOT RECEIVED ITSELF
WHILE THERE ITS CASUALTY LIST FOR JANUARY WAS EXTRAORDINARILY LOW
BEING ONLY TWO MEN KILLED AND TWENTYSIX WOUNDED ONE OFFICER
CAPTAIN GORDON WOUNDED AND ONE 2ND LIEUTENANT D A B MOODIE IN
HOSPITAL DURING THE MONTH 2ND LIEUTENANTS A S STOKES AND L H
L CARVER JOINED AND 2ND LIEUTENANT A W G JAMRACK REJOINED FROM
THE REINFORCEMENT BATTALION

ON THE 1ST FEBRUARY ORDERS CAME THAT THE LINE WAS TO BE HELD BY
ALL THREE BRIGADES OF THE GUARDS DIVISION INSTEAD OF TWO FOR IT
MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT EACH BRIGADE WAS SHORT ONE BATTALION THE
REARRANGEMENT DREW MORE HEAVILY ON THE WORKINGPARTIES IN THE FORWARD
AREA WHERE A NEW FOUL TRENCHHYDERABAD SUPPORTWAS UNDER WAY THEY
SUPPLIED FROM TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED MEN AS NEED WAS AND LIVED IN ARRAS
PRISON IN LUXURYWIRE BEDS AND PALLIASSES FOR EVERY MANTILL THE
6TH FEBRUARY WHEN THEY RELIEVED THE 2ND COLDSTREAM IN THE FRONT
LINE THE SUPPORTTRENCHES HERE WERE THE BEST THEY HAD FOUND BEING
DEEP DUCKBOARDED WELL REVETTED AND WITH PLENTY OF DUGOUTS AND AN
ENVIABLE SYSTEM OF COOKHOUSES DELIVERING HOT MEALS IN THE ACTUAL
TRENCHES THEY SENT WORKINGPARTIES TO THE INSATIABLE ENGINEERS AND
THE BRIGADE AT LARGE FOR FRESH TRENCHES WERE BEING SKETCHED OUT IF
NOT BUILT AGAINST THE IMPENDING GERMAN ATTACK

THE FRONT LINE FROM THE 10TH TO THE 13TH FEBRUARY WAS REMARKABLY
QUIET BUT NOT EASY THEIR PATROLS FOUND NO ENEMY NOR ANY SIGN OF
THEM IN NO MANS LAND A LITTLE WIRING OF NIGHTS WAS POSSIBLE AND
THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES BUT THE TRENCHSTRENGTH OF THE BATTALION
WAS WEAK16 OFFICERS AND 398 RANKS AND EVERY ONE HAD TO WORK
DOUBLETIDES TO KEEP THE WAYS OPEN

THEY WERE RELIEVED ON ST VALENTINES DAY TWO DAYS AFTER THE 4TH
GUARDS BRIGADE WHICH TOOK WITH THEM THE 2ND IRISH GUARDS HAD BEEN
FORMED UNDER LORD ARDEE AND ADDED TO THE THIRTYFIRST DIVISION

THREE DAYS IN ARRAS PRISON SAW THEM BACK AGAIN IN SUPPORT JUST IN
TIME TO GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF ANOTHER DAYS THAW IT WAS A QUIET
TOUR ONE MAN WAS KILLED BY A TRENCHMORTAR ONE BADLY WOUNDED BY A
RIFLEGRENADE SEVEN BY SHELLSPLINTERS OUTSIDE A DUGOUT AND FIVE
MEN GASSED THE ENEMY CONFINED HIMSELF TO LONGRANGE TRENCHMORTARS
AND AN INCREASE IN AERIAL ACTIVITY HE WAS NOTICED TO OBJECT
VERY STRONGLY TO OUR AIRCRAFT CROSSING HIS LINES NEVER WAS ENEMY
MORE ANXIOUS NOT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIS MOVES AND FAR BEHIND OUR
LINE AT ARRAS AND ELSEWHERE MEN DUG AND ENTRENCHED AND SKETCHED
WORKS OF DEFENCE TO MEET THE GERMAN RUSH WHILE THE FRONT TRENCHES
SAT STILL AND LOOKED ACROSS DESERTS APPARENTLY EMPTY OF LIFE TILL
A HEAD MOVED IN THE OPEN IT WAS A SEASON WITHOUT PARALLEL IN OUR
ARMIES EXPERIENCETHIS MERE WAITING FOR A CERTAIN BLOW TO BE DEALT
AT A CERTAIN TIME NO WRITTEN HISTORY RECORDS THE PSYCHOLOGY OF
THOSE SPRING DAYS THE DIARY IS CONCERNED WITH THE BATTALIONS OWN
SORROW HERE IS THE STORY AS WRITTEN DURING THE MONTH FEBRUARY
THE HOUSEHOLD BATTALION WAS DISBANDED AND EIGHTY MEN WERE ALLOTTED
TO THE BATTALION THIS MARKS THE BEGINNING AND IS THE FIRST
OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THE IRISH GUARDS CANNOT KEEP
UP THE SUPPLY OF IRISH TROOPS A MOST REGRETTABLE EPOCH IN THE
HISTORY OF THE REGIMENT ON THE HEELS OF THIS COMES COMICALLY
ENOUGH ALMOST THE SOLE PERSONAL EXPRESSION OF FEELING IN THE ENTIRE
DIARY THEY WENT ON THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY INTO REST AT GORDON
CAMP CHRISTENED AFTER THE 9TH GORDONS WHO MADE IT IT IS WITHOUT
EXCEPTION THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND BESTLAIDOUT CAMP I HAVE EVER
BEEN IN EVERYTHING THAT ONE COULD POSSIBLY WISH FOR IS HEREEVEN AN
OFFICERS BATHROOM WITH PORCELAIN BATH AND HOT AND COLD WATER LAID
ON IT WAS AN ALLTOOSHORT INTERVAL IN COLD AND DIRTY WORK FOR
ON THE 2ND MARCH THE SCARPE TRENCHES RECLAIMED THEMFAMPOUX COLT
RESERVE PEPPER AND PUDDINGIN SNOW SLEET AND UNBROKEN MONOTONY OF
WORKINGPARTIES

ON THE 6TH MARCH THE DIARY NOTES THAT THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHOM THEY
RELIEVED THE NEXT DAY CARRIED OUT A RAID SUCCESSFUL IN ITSELF AND
DOUBLY SO AS DRAWING NO RETALIATION ON THEIR OWN LINE IT RESULTED IN
TWO IDENTIFIABLE PRISONERS AND A MACHINEGUN BUT BATTALIONS DO NOT
APPROVE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS RAIDING WHEN THE ENEMY IS NERVOUS


THE MARCH PUSH

THEIR NEXT FRONTLINE TURN6TH TO 10TH MARCHWAS UTTERLY
UNEVENTFUL AND ON THE 12TH THEY BEING THEN IN STIRLING CAMP WERE
ORDERED TO STAND TO FOR THE EXPECTED GERMAN OFFENSIVE IT PROVED
TO BE NO MORE THAN A LIGHT SHELLING SO THE STILL FINE DAYS IN LINE
OR IN SUPPORT RAN OUT TILL THE DAWN OF THE 21ST MARCH WHEN THE
GREAT SHELLS SUDDENLY DESCENDED ON ARRAS AND RUMOURS WORSE THAN
ANY SHELLING FOLLOWED THEIR TRACKS SAYS THE DIARY THE GERMAN
OFFENSIVE HAS BEGUN

THE EVACUATION OF THE TOWN DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS WAS A
NIGHTMARE OF FLYING MASONRY CLOUDS OF DUST THE ROAR OF FALLING
BRICKWORK CONTRADICTORY ORDERS AND MOBS OF DRIFTING CIVILIANS
THEIR BELONGINGS PUSHED BEFORE OR HAULED AFTER THEM AND NO POWER TO
ORDER THEM WHERE TO GO ARRAS ALWAYS IN THE FRONT LINE HAD BEEN
SAFE SO LONG IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE REAL DANGER
NOW MIGHT THEY NOT CAMP OUT AND RETURN TOMORROW BUT THE ENEMY
WERE REPORTED ALMOST IN SIGHT AND READY TO OPEN ON THE TOWN WITH
THEIR FIELDGUNS THEY HAD BROKEN THROUGH MEN SAID UNDER COVER OF
THE HEAVY MORNING FOGBROKEN THROUGH EVERYWHERE ALONG THE LINE OF
ALL OUR OLD GAINS FROM LENS TO ST QUENTIN AND THEIR WHOLE STRENGTH
WAS BEHIND THE BLOW NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH ALL MEN
ARGUED AND WHILE THE REFUGEES FLED FORTH EXPOSTULATING BLAMING
BUT SELDOM WEEPING THAT SUNNY DAY EIGHT HUNDRED SHELLS FELL
PURPOSEFULLY ON THE DISHEVELLED TOWN BY EVENING WORD CAME THAT OUR
SOMME LINE HAD NOT ONLY BROKEN BUT GONE OUTINFANTRY ARTILLERY AND
UNCOUNTED STORESBETWEEN CHRISY AND DEMICOURT IN THE NORTH SOUTH
OF THAT THE OLD CAMBRAI SALIENT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN HARDLY TRIED
WAS STANDING BUT WOULD HAVE TO WITHDRAW OR BE CUT OFF BECAUSE FROM
GOUZEAUCOURT TO LA FRE TEN MILES AND MORE SOUTH OF ST QUENTIN THE
GERMAN TIDE HAD SWEPT IN FROM ONE TO THREE MILES DEEP AND WAS RACING
FORWARD IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE WHAT MANNER OF REPORTS
THE MERE TRUTH GAVE BIRTH TO WHILE THE BATTALION WAITED ON IN THE
COMMUNAL COLLEGE WHERE IT WAS BILLETED AND WAS NOT ENCOURAGED TO
WANDER ABOUT THE ROCKING SLIDING STREETS

BY THE EVENING OF THE 22ND MARCH MEN BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND IT WAS NO
MERE BREAKTHROUGH BUT A COLLAPSE SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEFALLEN BRITISH
ARMS IN THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE OFFICERS WERE SENT OUT IN THE
MORNING TO RECONNOITRE THE SUPPORTLINE OF A THIRD SYSTEM OF DEFENCE
BETWEEN WANCOURT AND HNINSURCOJEUL BUT HNINSURCOJEUL WAS
ALREADY UNDER THE HAND OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD GAINED THREE MORE MILES
IN A FEW HOURS AND LEFT AND RIGHT WERE WIDENING THE BREACH

THE MORNING OF THE 22ND MARCH HAD BEEN FOGGY AGAIN TILL NOON AND
UNDER THAT COVER THE GERMANS HAD AGAIN BROKEN IN ON OUR SURPRISED
OR WITHDRAWING DIVISIONS REPORT SAID THAT WHOLE BATTALIONS AND
EVEN BRIGADES HAD BEEN CUT OFF BY THE FLOOD THEIR WIRELESS WORKING
FAITHFULLY SO LONG AS IT STOOD AND THE SOUND OF THEIR SMALLARM FIRE
CONTINUING FOR A WHILE AFTER THEIR LAST WORDS HAD CEASED LATE THAT
EVENING ORDERS CAME FOR THE BATTALION TO MOVE AT MIDNIGHT FROM ARRAS
TO BOISLEUXST MARC SOME SIX MILES DUE SOUTH OF THE TOWN ON A LINE
MORE OR LESS PREPARED AGAINST EVENTUALITIES AND WITH THEIR BRIGADE
TO GIVE WHAT HELP THEY COULD TO THE DIVISIONS WHO MIGHT BE FALLING
BACK ON THAT FRONT THIS WAS ALL THAT COULD BE MADE OUT OF THE MASS
OF CONTRADICTORY ORDERS THAT AFFLICTED THEM AND THE GROWING CROP OF
RUMOURS AND ALARMS THAT UPSET MEN ALMOST MORE THAN ANY COUNTERMANDED
ORDERS

THE BATTALION SET TO WORK ON THE 23RD MARCH TO DIG A SUPPORTLINE
IN REAR OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE ARMY LINE WHICH RAN IN FRONT OF
BOISLEUXST MARC WHILE THE EVACUATION OF ARRAS WAS BEING COMPLETED
AND ALL DETAILS AND DRUMMERS MARCHED TO THE REINFORCEMENT BATTALION
AT AGNEZLESDUISANS ON THE SCARPE WELL TO THE WEST OF ARRAS IN
THOSE DAYS WE WAS THROUBLED THE WAY A MAN IS DISTHRESSED IN DHREAMS
ALL MANNER OF THINGS HAPPENING YELL UNDERSTAND AND HIM THE ONLY
ONE ABLE TO DO NOTHING BUT I WISHT ID BEEN A MUSICANER

THE DIARY FOR THE 24TH MARCH MERELY SAYS REMAINED IN SAME
POSITIONS AND REFERS TO REPEATED RUMOURS THEY SENT THEIR
FIRSTLINE TRANSPORT BACK OUT OF HARMS WAY AND WENT ON DIGGING YET
THE 24TH WAS A DAY NO RUMOUR COULD HAVE PAINTED MUCH BLACKER THAN
IT WAS FROM DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE GUARDS DIVISION AT BOISLEUX
THE LINE OF THE GERMAN GAINS IN THE PAST FORTYEIGHT HOURS DROPPED
STRAIGHT SOUTH TO THE SOMME AT CLRY AND THENCE SKIRTED ITS WESTERN
BANK TO HAM WHERE IT BROKE ACROSS TO THE WIDE MARSHES OF THE OISE
BELOW LA FRE TWO THIRDS OF THE HARDBOUGHT GROUND OF THE SOMME
CAMPAIGN THE SCORES OF VILLAGES WHOSE NAMES SMELT OF BLOOD WERE
LOST AND THE HARVESTING OF THE REMAINDER WAS A MATTER BARELY OF
HOURS

NEXT DAY SAW BHAGNIES GRVILLERS IRLES OF THE WIRED BASTIONS
MIRAUMONT PYS COURCELETTE CONTALMAISON THIEPVAL AND ITS MYRIAD
DEAD AND POZIRES OF THE AUSTRALIANSTHE VERY HEARTS OF THE
DEADLIEST OF THE FIRST FIGHTINGSOVERRUN AND THE QUESTION ROSE
IN MENS MINDS WHETHER THE DRIVE WOULD END AS WAS INTENDED IN
THE SPLITTING APART OF THE FRENCH AND BRITISH ARMIES FOR WHAT WAS
HAPPENING NORTH OF THE SOMME WAS PLAY TO THE SITUATION SOUTH OF IT
THERE THE ENEMYS SWARMS OF AEROPLANES HARRIED THE AMIENS HOSPITALS
DRIVING THE CIVILIANS INTO THE BROADSIDE OF THE COUNTRY BEHIND WHERE
THE MOONLIGHT NIGHTS BETRAYED THEM TO FRESH HOSTS IN THE AIR

BY THE 26TH MARCH THE TONGUE OF THE ADVANCING TIDE HAD LICKED PAST
NOYON AND ROYE AND NEXT DAY HAD ENCIRCLED MONTDIDIER MEANTIME
OUR OLD SOMME BASE ON THE ANCRE WHENCE THE GREAT FIGHTS WERE FED
AND SUPPLIED FROM THE HUNDRED CAMPS AND DUMPS ROUND MAULTE AND
THE RAILWAYSIDINGS BETWEEN ALBERT AND AMIENS HAD PASSED INTO THE
ENEMYS HANDS TO ALL HUMAN APPEARANCE THE WHOLE OF OUR BITTER
YEARS EFFORT WAS ABOLISHED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN THE ENEMY
HAD PREPARED BROUGHT TOGETHER AND STRUCK AT THE TIME THAT BEST
SUITED HIMSELF WITH SEVENTYTHREE DIVISIONS AGAINST THIRTYSEVEN
BRITISH DIVISIONS AND THE OUTCOME WAS APPALLING DEFEAT OF OUR ARMS

IT WOULD THUS SEEM THAT NO AMOUNT OF INSPIRING STATESMANSHIP AT HOME
OR ANXIOUS READJUSTMENT OF DIVISIONS AT THE FRONT WILL MAKE TROOPS
WHERE TROOPS ARE NOT THEREFORE THE BATTALIONS AND BATTERIES IN THE
FULL BLAST OF THE ONSET PERISHED OR WERE TAKEN PRISONERS AND OF THE
STORES CAPTURED OR DESTROYED LEST THEY SHOULD BENEFIT THE ENEMY
WE MAY LOOK TO RECEIVE NO ACCOUNT NOT THE LEAST DEPRESSING OF THE
SIGHTS THAT ADORNED THE LANDSCAPES WERE THE DUMPS LIT BY OUR OWN
HANDS FLARING TO HEAVEN WHEN AS TURNED OUT AFTERWARDS THERE WAS
REALLY NO NEED DIVISIONS WERE BEING RACED UP TO REINFORCE THE FLUID
FRONT AS FAST AS MIGHT BE BUT NO ONE KNEW FOR CERTAIN WHEN OR WHERE
THEY WOULD ARRIVE AND CAMP COMMANDANTS ACTED ON THEIR OWN JUDGMENTS
THE BATTALIONS IN THE LINE SWAYED TO CONFLICTING STORMS OF ORDERS


STANDINGTO

ON THE 25TH BEING STILL AT BOISLEUXST MARC THE 1ST IRISH
GUARDS WERE DETAILED TO RELIEVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT UNITS BUT
MORE SPECIALLY THE 1ST COLDSTREAM JUST EAST OF HAMELINCOURT THEN
PRACTICALLY IN POSSESSION OF THE ENEMY ONE FOUND OUT WHERE THE
ENEMY WERE BY SEEING THEM COME OVER THE BROWS OF UNEXPECTED SLOPES
IN SMALL GROUPS THAT THINNED OUT AND SETTLED DOWN TO MACHINEGUNNING
UNDER COVER OF EQUALLY UNEXPECTED FIELDGUNS THEY SPENT THE WHOLE
DAY BEING HIT AND HELD IN THIS FASHION AND CLOSE ON MIDNIGHT GOT
DEFINITE INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO WAIT FOR ANY RELIEF BUT TO GO OFF TO THE
SUGARFACTORY NEAR BOYELLES WHICH THEY DID AND BESTOWED THEMSELVES
IN HUTS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THERE WERE HOTLY SHELLED DURING
THE NIGHT THE GERMAN ATTACK WAS WELL HOME ON THAT SECTOR NOW AND
THE GERMAN INFANTRY MIGHT BE LOOKED FOR AT ANY MOMENT THEY REMOVED
FROM THOSE UNHEALTHY HUTS TO AN OLD TRENCH NEXT MORNING WHERE THEIR
FIRST SET OF ORDERS WAS TO RELIEVE THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS ORDER
PROVISIONAL DEFINITE AND CANCELLED ALL IN TWO HOURS AND A HALF
LATER CAME ORDERSEQUALLY DEFINITE EQUALLY WASHED OUT LATERTO
RELIEVE THE 2ND COLDSTREAM IN ANOTHER SECTOR AND FINALLY JUST BEFORE
MIDNIGHT THEY RELIEVED THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS AFTER ALL THAT BATTALION
HAD BEEN IN THE ARMY LINE BETWEEN ST LGER AND HNIN BUT THE
ENEMYS ADVANCE HAD FORCED IT BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF BOISLEUXST
MARC NEAR THE ARRASALBERT RAILWAYLINE THE BATTALION FOUND IT A
LITTLE BEFORE DAWN AND LAY OUT WITH ALL FOUR COMPANIES IN THE FRONT
LINE AS DID THE OTHER BATTALIONS BY THIS TIME THOUGH IT WOULD BE
NOT EASY TO TRACE THEIR VARIOUS ARRIVALS IN THE CONFUSION THE GUARDS
BRIGADES HAD GOT INTO LINE BETWEEN BOISLEUXST MARC AND AYETTE
ON A FRONT OF ROUGHLY THREE AND A HALF MILES WHILE BATTALIONS OF
EXHAUSTED AND WITHDRAWING DIVISIONS HARD PRESSED BY THE ENEMY
PASSED THROUGH THEM EACH WITH ITS BURDEN OF BAD NEWS IT WAS NOT AN
INSPIRITING SIGHT NOR WAS THE ACTUAL POSITION OF THE GUARDS BRIGADES
ONE TO BE ENVIED HIGH GROUND COMMANDED THEM THROUGHOUT AND A NUMBER
OF HUTS AND HALFRUINED BUILDINGS GAVE GOOD COVER TO THE GATHERING
MACHINEGUNS THE GERMAN ADVANCE ON THAT QUARTER RESEMBLED AS ONE
IMAGINATIVE SOUL PUT IT AN ENCOMPASSMENT OF WEREWOLVES THEY
SLOUCHED FORWARD WHILE MEN RUBBED TIRED EYES IN TWOS AND THREES
AT NO POINT OFFERING ANY DEFINITE TARGET EITHER FOR SMALLARM OR
ARTILLERY AND YET IN SOME WIZARD FASHION ALWAYS THICKENING AND
SPREADING WHILE OUR GUNS FROM THE REAR RAGED AND TORE USELESSLY AT
THEIR ALMOST INVISIBLE LINES INCIDENTALLY TOO OUR OWN GUNFIRE IN
SOME SECTORS AND NOTABLY BEHIND THE FOURTH GUARDS BRIGADE DID OUR
MEN NO SERVICE BUT THE MOST ELABORATE OF PREPARATIONS HAVE AN END
AND MUST CULMINATE IN THE CHARGE HOME

AN INTENSE BARRAGE ON THE MORNING OF THE 27TH MARCH HERALDED THE
CRISIS BUT LUCKILY WENT WIDE OF ALL THE BATTALION EXCEPT NO 2
COMPANY ON THE LEFT THE ATTACK FOLLOWED AND DOWN THE TRENCHED
LINE FROM AYETTE AND BOISLEUXST MARC THE BRIGADE ANSWERED WITH
UNBROKEN MUSKETRY AND LEWISGUNS IT WAS AN ALMOST SATISFACTORY
SLAUGHTER DEALT OUT BY TIRED BUT RESOLUTE MEN WITH THEIR BACKS
TO THE WALL EXCEPT FOR OCCASIONAL RUSHES OF THE ENEMY CUT DOWN
ERE THEY REACHED THE WIRE THERE WAS NOTHING SPECTACULAR IN THAT
DAYS WORK THE BATTALION SHOT AND KEPT ON SHOOTING AS IT HAD BEEN
TRAINED TO DO IN THE INSTRUCTIONCAMPS AND ON THE COMFORTABLE RANGES
THAT SEEMED NOW SO INCONCEIVABLY FAR AWAY THE ENEMY HAVING DIRECT
OBSERVATION OVER THE WHOLE OF OUR LINE SHOT WELL AND CLOSE WE
SUFFERED BUT THEY SUFFERED MORE THEY RANGED ALONG THE FRONT FROM
NORTH TO SOUTH AS WAVES RANGE DOWN THE FACE OF A BREAKWATER BUT
FOUND NOTHING TO CARRY AWAY OR EVEN DISLODGE NIGHT CLOSED IN WITH A
LAST RUSH AT THE WIRE ON THE BATTALIONS FRONT THAT LEFT A WRECKAGE
OF GERMAN DEAD AND WOUNDED AND TWO MACHINEGUNS HORRIBLY HUNG UP
IN THE STRANDS OUR LOSSES IN OFFICERS WERE 2ND LIEUTENANT STOKES
SEVERELY WOUNDED IN THE MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON LIEUTENANT
NASH KILLED AND CAPTAIN DEREK FITZGERALD WOUNDED AND SENT DOWN
LIEUTCOLONEL R V POLLOK AND LIEUTENANTS BENCEJONES AND BAGENAL
WERE ALSO SLIGHTLY WOUNDED BUT REMAINED AT DUTY WHEN AN OFFICER
DROPPED AND COULD NOT GET UP AGAIN WITHOUT HELP HE WAS ASSUMED TO BE
UNFIT FOR WORKBUT NOT BEFORE

YELL UNDERSTAND TWAS NO QUESTION THOSE DAYS WHAT YE COULD OR
COULD NOT DO YE DID IT

AND SO ENDED THE 27TH OF MARCH WITH THE GERMAN FRONT FROM LENS TO
ALBERT HELD UP AND DESTINED THOUGH MEN THEN SCARCE DARED BELIEVE
NOT TO ADVANCE TO ANOTHER EFFECTIVE SURGE THE FRENCH AND BRITISH
ARMIES WERE PERILOUSLY NEAR FORCED ASUNDER NOW AND THE NEEDS OF THE
CASE COMPELLING WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO GENERAL FOCH IN
THE LITTLE CITY OF DOULLENS WAS ON THE 26TH MARCH GIVEN SUPREME
COMMAND OF ALL THE HARDPRESSED HOSTS THE NEWS WENT OUT AT ONCE
INTO THE FRONT LINE WHERE MEN RECEIVED IT AS PART AND PARCEL OF
THE IMMENSE SITUATION NOTHING COULD HAVE ASTONISHED THEM THEN OR
UNLESS IT DIRECTLY CONCERNED FOOD OR REST HAVE MADE THEM THINK

THE BATTALION WAS PLACED WHERE IT WAS TO ENDURE AND WAS THANKFUL
THAT THE 28TH WAS A FAIRLY QUIET DAY BUT FOR HEAVY SHELLING ON
THEIR RIGHT AND TRENCHMORTARS AND SHELLS ON THEMSELVES NO 2
COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN UNLUCKY WITH THE BIG BARRAGE THE DAY BEFORE
SUFFERED ONCE AGAIN

NEXT DAY 29TH MARCH WHICH WAS ANOTHER QUIET OCCASION LIEUTENANT
ZIGOMALA WAS WOUNDED AND FORTY OF THE MOST TIRED MEN WERE RELIEVED
BY AN EQUAL NUMBER FROM THE REINFORCEMENT BATTALION WHICH RELIEF
BECAME SYSTEMATIZED AS IT EASED THE STRAIN A LITTLE TO CLEAR OUT
VISIBLY FINISHED MEN DAY BY DAY ALL WERE WORN DOWN BUT REMAINED
CHEERFUL THOSE WHO HAVE FULL RIGHT TO SPEAK AFFIRM THAT IN
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE SITUATIONS THE IRISH COULD BE TRUSTED TO PLAY
UP BEYOND EVEN A COCKNEY BATTALION THE MATTER WILL ALWAYS BE IN
DISPUTE BUT NONE KNOW BETTER THAN THE MEN WHO SAW THE PUSH THROUGH
HOW SUPERBLY THE MUDCAKED WIREDRAWN PLATOONS BORE THEMSELVES

ON THE 30TH MARCH THE ATTACK ROLLED UP AGAIN FROM THE SOUTH WHERE IT
HAD MET NO PARTICULAR ENCOURAGEMENT AND BARRAGED THE BATTALIONS
SECTOR WITH HEAVIES FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS CAUSING FORTYTWO
CASUALTIES AMONG THE MEN AND WOUNDING LIEUTENANTS STACPOOLE AND
BAGENAL IT THEN FELL UPON THE 2ND GRENADIERS AND 1ST COLDSTREAM
IMMEDIATELY TO THE BATTALIONS LEFT AND RIGHT AND WAS DRIVEN OFF
WITH LOSS THERE WERE OTHER ATTACKS BUT WITH LESS VENOM IN THEM
BEFORE THE HUN COULD BE INDUCED TO WITHDRAW HALF THE BATTALION SPENT
THE NIGHT DIGGING A LINE OF POSTS IN SUPPORT WHICH THEY OCCUPIED BY
DAWN

ON THE LAST OF MARCH NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURRED EVERYTHING
INDEED HAD OCCURRED ALREADY THE OLD SOMME SALIENT WHICH ENGLISH
FASHION HAD BECOME AN INSTITUTION WAS COMPLETELY REVERSED ON THE
OMINOUS NEWSPAPER MAPS THE GERMANS STOOD ATIPTOE LOOKING INTO
AMIENS AND PRACTICALLY THE ENTIRE SPARE STRENGTH OF THE BRITISH
ARMIES IN FRANCE HAD BEEN USED AND USED UP TO BRING THEM TO THAT
STAND THE FRENCH WERE EQUALLY WORN DOWN THE AMERICAN ARMIES WERE
NOT YET IN PLACE AND WHAT REINFORCING DIVISIONS WERE READY IN
ENGLAND SOMEWHAT LACKED TRAINING

THE BATTALION A STRAW AMONG THESE WAVES HAD IN THE MONTH LOST
BESIDES OFFICERS TWENTYTHREE OTHER RANKS KILLED AND ONE HUNDRED AND
SEVEN WOUNDED AND ONE MISSING IT IS EVEN REPORTED THAT THERE HAD
BEEN MANY DAYS ON WHICH OWING TO PRESS OF WORK THEY HAD NOT SHAVED
THAT YELL UNDERSTAND IS BEING DIRTY AN A CRIME BELIEVE ME
NOW THERE WAS TIMES WHEN WE WAS ALL CRIMINALS EVEN MR  AN
IT DISTHRESSED HIM MORE THAN BLOODY WAR

THE FIERCENESS OF THE ENEMYS ATTACK ON THE 28TH MARCHRANGING FROM
PUISIEUX TO NORTHEAST OF ARRASHAD BEEN TO AN EXTENT HIS OWN
UNDOING FOR HE HAD THROWN HIS MEN IN SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN SIX
LINES AT SOME SPOTS AND OUR GUNS HAD CAUGHT THEM MASSED FORMING UP
BUT THE CHECK SEVERE AS IT WAS DID NOT CHOKE OFF A FINAL EFFORT
AGAINST THE STRAINED BRITISH AND FRENCH CORDON ON THE 4TH AND 5TH
OF APRIL THE MAIN WEIGHT OF IT ON THE FIRST DAY FELL SOUTH OF
THE SOMME AND ON THE SECOND NORTH FROM DERNANCOURT BELOW MAULTE
TO BUCQUOY WHICH IS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS GOMIECOURT EXCEPT THAT
THE EASTERN SIDE OF BUCQUOY WAS CARRIED FOR A TIME THE NORTHERN
ATTACK WAS COMPLETELY HELD AND SO AT LAST AFTER A HEARTSHATTERING
FORTNIGHT THE SOMME FRONT CAME TO REST THE BATTALION WITH ITS
HEADQUARTERS UNDER MUCH TOO DIRECT ENEMY OBSERVATION NEAR BOIRYST
MARTIN REVERTED TO ITS ANCIENT ROUTINE OF TRENCHWORK AND RELIEFS
UNDER SHELLFIRE

THE DAYS INCLUDED REGULAR BURSTS OF SHELLING A LARGE PROPORTION OF
WHICH WAS BLUE OR YELLOWCROSS GAS AND WHEN THE BATTALION LAY IN
RESERVE THEY WERE KEPT AWAKE BY OUR ENERGETIC BATTERIES ON THREE
SIDES OF THEM

THEIR ST MARTIN CAMP WAS A SCIENTIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED DEATHTRAP
MOST OF IT WAS UNDER ENEMY OBSERVATION AND WITHOUT GROUNDSHELTER
WHAT SHOTS RANGED OVER OUR FORWARD BATTERIES OR SHORT OF OUR REAR
ONES FOUND THEIR CAMP WHEN OUR 15INCH GUNS RETALIATED FROM A
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS BEHIND THEM THE BLAST EXTINGUISHED ALL
CANDLES THE DIARY OBSERVES THE NOISE AND THE HOSTILE RETALIATION
MADE PROPER REST DIFFICULT THAT WAS ON THE 4TH APRIL WHEN THE
ATTACK SOUTH OF THE SOMME WAS IN FULL SWING

ON THE 5TH APRIL THEIR HUTS IN BRIGADERESERVE WERE SHELLED FOR HALF
AN HOUR WITH SIX CASUALTIES AND WHEN THEY WENT INTO THE LINE ON
A NEW SECTOR HELD BY SCATTERED POSTS NEARLY EVERY ONE OF THEIR
GUIDES LOST HIS MISERABLE WAY IN THE DARK HEADQUARTERS HERE WERE
PITCHED IN AN OLD GERMAN TRENCH AND THENFOR THEY WERE NOT EVEN
RAINPROOFSHIFTED TO THE EDGE OF BOIRYST MARTIN VILLAGE A CELLAR
HAD TO BE DUG OUT AND SUPPORTED AND THE RAIN DESCENDED ON THE
MUDPIE THAT IT WAS AND WHEN HEADQUARTERS AND ALL THEIR PAPERS
HAD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES THE ENEMY GASBOMBARDED THE VILLAGE
WITH PERFECT ACCURACY THE COMMANDING OFFICER LIEUTCOLONEL R V
POLLOK THE ASSISTANT ADJUTANT LIEUTENANT J N WARD AND THE M O
CAPTAIN WOODHOUSE HAD TO BE SENT DOWN SUFFERING FROM YELLOWCROSS
GAS AFTEREFFECTS

CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE WOES OF A BATTALION HEADQUARTERS IN THE
FIELD LATE IN JANUARY CAPTAIN GORDON THE PUKKA ADJUTANT RIDING
TO ARRAS FOR A BATH CANTERS INTO A BARRAGE OF HEAVIES AND IS
WOUNDED IN THE HANDA VITAL SPOT FOR ADJUTANTS THIS LEAVES ONLY THE
CO AND THE ASSISTANT ADJUTANT LIEUTENANT J N WARD TO CARRY ON
AND WHATEVER THE STATE OF THE FRONT THE AUTHORITIES DEMAND THEIR
REGULAR SUPPLY OF PAPERS AND FORMS NO SOONER HAS THE ASSISTANT
ADJUTANT GOT ABREAST OF THINGS THAN ALL BATTALION HEADQUARTERS ARE
KNOCKED OUT IN AN HOUR LUCKILY THEY WERE ONLY AWAY FOR THREE OR
FOUR DAYS THE ENEMY ADDED A SMALL AND EASILY BEATEN OFF RAID TO THE
CONFUSION HE HAD MADE IN ORDERLYROOM MAJOR BAGGALLAY TOOK OVER THE
COMMAND AND CAPTAIN BUDD ADEQUATE AND UNTROUBLED AS EVER WHO HAD
HELD THE GHOSTLY F POST ON THE SCARPE ACTED AS ADJUTANT OFFICERS
WERE BEGINNING TO WEAR OUT NOW THREE OF THE MOST TIRED WERE SENT
DOWN AND REPLACED BY SUBSTITUTES FROM THE REINFORCEMENT BATTALION

THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS JOINED FOR DUTY ON THE 10TH APRIL LIEUTENANT

IT WAS ON THE MORNING OF THE 9TH APRIL THAT THE ENEMY OPENED HIS
SECOND GREAT THRUST ON THE LYS AND THE THREE WEEKS FIGHTING THAT
ALL BUT WIPED OUT THE YPRES SALIENT WON HIM MESSINES KEMMEL
ARMENTIRES NEUVE EGLISE BAILLEUL MERVILLE AND CARRIED HIM
TOWARDS THE CHANNEL PORTS WITHIN FIVE MILES OF HAZEBROUCK THAT
THE STROKE WAS EXPECTED MADE IT NONE THE LESS SEVERE SPRING ON
THAT FRONT HAD CHOSEN TO BE UNSEASONABLY DRY THE LOWLANDS IN THE
LYS VALLEY NORMALLY THEIR OWN BEST DEFENCES GAVE PASSAGE TO MEN
AND GUNS WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN STILL IMPASSABLE WHATEVER ELSE
MAY HAVE BETRAYED THEM THE GERMANS HAD NO CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE
WEATHER THROUGHOUT THE WAR OR INDEED OF THE FORESIGHT OF THEIR
ADVERSARIES THEY HAD TO DEAL CHIEFLY WITH DIVISIONS THAT HAD BEEN
FOUGHT OUT IN THE SOMME PUSH REINFORCED WITH FILLINGS FROM ENGLAND
AND SENT NORTHWARD IN A HURRY SIR DOUGLAS HAIGS DESPATCHES GIVE THE
RELATIVE DISPARITY THUS

IN THE LYS BATTLE PRIOR TO THE 30TH APRIL THE ENEMY ENGAGED
AGAINST THE BRITISH FORCES A TOTAL OF 42 DIVISIONS OF WHICH 33
WERE FRESH AND 9 HAD FOUGHT PREVIOUSLY ON THE SOMME AGAINST THESE
42 GERMAN DIVISIONS 25 BRITISH DIVISIONS WERE EMPLOYED OF WHICH 8
WERE FRESH AND 17 HAD TAKEN A PROMINENT PART IN THE SOMME BATTLE

THESE WERE WORN OUT AND AS THE DAYS OF FIGHTING CONTINUED MANY OF
THEM WERE SO DEAD TO THE WORLD THAT THEY LAID THEM DOWN AND SLEPT
WHERE THEY DROPPED BY BATTALIONS WHEN ORDERS CAME IT WAS A MATTER
ALMOST OF ROUTINE THAT EACH SENIOR HANDING THEM ON SHOULD ASSAULT
HIS JUNIOR INTO SOME SORT OF COMPREHENSION OFFICERS DARED NOT TRUST
THEMSELVES EVEN TO LEAN AGAINST WALLS FOR FEAR THEY SHOULD SLIDE
DOWN DEAD ASLEEP AND AS A PRIVATE OF THE LINE PUT IT IN CONFESSION
I DONT KNOW WHAT THE MEN WOULD HAVE DONE BUT FOR STANDING SENTRY
THEY GOT THEIR SLEEP THEN THERE IS A STORY OF A TATTERED BRIGADE
EIGHT DAYS OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEN WITHOUT CLOSING AN EYELID
WHICH WAS FLUNG BACK INTO THE FIGHT AFTER ASSURANCE OF RELIEF
AND WHAT WAS MUCH WORSE A FEW HOURS REST THEY RETURNED LIKE
SLEEPWALKERS AND LAID THEM DOWN IN SOME SHALLOW HENSCRATCHINGS
THAT PASSED FOR TRENCHWORK WHERE WITHOUT EMOTION THEY RESIGNED
THEMSELVES TO BEING BLOWN OUT OR UP IN DETAIL WHILE THEY WATCHED
DROWSILY THE DESCENT AND THICKENING OF A FRESH GERMAN SHELLSTORM
PRELUDING FRESH INFANTRY ATTACKS IT OCCURRED TO THEM VAGUELY THAT
THERE WERE HIGH AND INCREASING NOISES OVERHEADNOT AT ALL LIKE THE
DEEP WHOOP OF HEAVIES THEN ALL THE DARKNESS BEHIND THE ENEMY LIT
WITH A LOW OUTLINING GROUNDFLARETHE DEATHDANCE OF INNUMERABLE
75S FOCH HAD SENT UP VERY MANY GUNS BEHIND THEM ALMOST WHEEL TO
WHEEL AND WHEN THE FRENCH GUNNERS AT LAST SHUT OFF THE PACKED ENEMY
TRENCHES THAT WERE WAITING TO CONTINUE THEIR MARCH TO THE CHANNEL AS
SOON AS THEIR OWN FIRE SHOULD HAVE WIPED UP THE FEW BRITISH BAYONETS
BEFORE THEM LAY AS STILL AS THE GRAVES THAT THEY WERE THEN WHAT
REMAINED OF THE BRIGADE THAT HAD SEEN THIS MIRACLE WAS RELIEVED BY
ANOTHER BRIGADE AND STRETCHED ITSELF OUT TO SLEEP BEHIND IT EXPERTS
IN MISERIES SAY THAT FOR SHEER STRAIN THE LYS OVERWENT ANYTHING
IMAGINED IN THE WAR AND IN THIS MANY WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH ARE
AGREED

THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE WHICH HAD BEEN IN BILLETS NEAR
VILLERSBRULIN AFTER ITS HEAVY WORK ON THE ARRAS SIDE WAS
DESPATCHED ON THE 10TH APRIL TO THE FLAT COUNTRY ROUND VIERHOEK AND
THEREAS WILL BE TOLDSPENT ITSELF IN THE DESPERATE FIGHTING ROUND
LA COURONNE AND VIEUXBERQUIN THAT GAVE TIME TO BAR THE ENEMIES WAY
TO HAZEBROUCK ANDWIPED OUT THE 2ND BATTALION

THE 1ST BATTALION SUFFICIENTLY OCCUPIED WITH ITS OWN FRONT NEAR
BOIRY WHERE THE SUPPORTLINES WERE TARGETS BY DAY AND NIGHT
AND THE FRONTPOSTS HOLES IN THE GROUND THAT SEEMED TO SHIFT AT
EVERY RELIEF WERE TOLD ON THE 12TH APRIL THAT A GERMAN ATTACK WAS
IMMINENT WHICH REPORT WAS REPEATED AT INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY
BUT THEIR PATROLS FOUND NOTHING MOVING IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEIR
REGULAR ALLOWANCE OF HOSTILE MORTARBOMBS WAS NOT INCREASED THE
RUMOURS FROM THE LYS SIDE WERE FAR MORE DISTURBING

ON THE 13TH APRIL THEY WERE RELIEVED BY THE 24TH LANCASHIRE
FUSILIERS MARCHED TO BLAIRVILLE WHERE THEY EMBUSSED FOR SAULTY AT
THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE RIVER THAT RUNS IN STONE CHANNELS THROUGH
QUIET DOULLENS AND THERE VERY COLD WET AND MUDDY FOUND THE
BEST BILLETS TAKEN BY CORPS AND LABOUR TROOPS WHOM THEY KNEW NOT THE
SENTIMENTS OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN DIGGING AND FIGHTING WITHOUT A BREAK
FOR TEN WEEKS WHEN CONFRONTED WITH WARMLY BILLETED STAFFS AND FAT
BACKAREA WORKINGPARTIES NEED NOT BE RECORDED

AT SAULTY THEY RESTED FROM THE 15TH TO THE 23RD APRIL UNDER PERPETUAL
SHORT NOTICE ONE HOUR FROM 8 A M TILL NOON AND THREE HOURS FOR THE
REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT THUS MEANS OF TRAINING WERE LIMITED AND
THE WEATHER VARIED FROM WET TO SNOWSHOWERS

ON THE 24TH OF APRIL THE ENEMY CAPTURED VILLERSBRETONNEUX STARING
DIRECTLY INTO AMIENS WHICH GROUND HAD THEY BEEN ALLOWED TO HOLD
UNINTERRUPTEDLY EVEN FOR A DAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE TOO STRONG TO
REDUCE WITH THE FORCES AT OUR DISPOSAL THEN AND THUS WOULD HAVE
BECOME THE VERY EDGE OF THE WEDGE FOR SPLITTING THE FRENCH AND
ENGLISH ARMIES ASUNDER BUT THAT NIGHT AND LITERALLY AT ALMOST
AN HOURS NOTICE A COUNTERATTACK BY A BRIGADE OF THE EIGHTEENTH
DIVISION AND THE 13TH AND 15TH BRIGADES OF THE FOURTH AND FIFTH
AUSTRALIAN DIVISIONS SWEPT VILLERSBRETONNEUX CLEAR AND ESTABLISHED
OURSELVES BEYOND POSSIBILITY OF EVICTION THUS THE ONE LAST CHANCE
THAT MIGHT HAVE SWUNG THE WHOLE WAR PASSED OUT OF THE ENEMYS HANDS

ON THAT SAME DAY THE 1ST IRISH GUARDS RETURNED IN LORRIES ALONG THE
CRAMPED AND TWISTING ROADS BY BIENVILLERS TO MONCHY TO RELIEVE A
BATTALION OF THE ROYAL SCOTS IN THE FRONT LINE AT AYETTE THREE
MILES SOUTH DOWN THE LINE FROM BOIRY AYETTE VILLAGE HAD BEEN
RECAPTURED ON THE 3RD APRIL BY THE THIRTYSECOND DIVISION AND HAD
REMOVED A THORN IN THE SIDE OF TROOPS IN THAT SECTOR ONCE AGAIN
THEIR GUIDES ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY LOST THEIR WAY AND THE MULTIVIOUS
RELIEF TOOK HALF THE NIGHT TO ACCOMPLISH

IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE ENEMY HAD SKINNED HIS LINE HERE TO FEED HIS
OTHER ENTERPRISES IN THE NORTH FOR HIS OUTPOSTS DID NOTHING AND
BEYOND SHELLING MONCHY VILLAGE FROM TIME TO TIME HIS GUNS WERE ALSO
IDLE

SO ON THE 29TH APRIL THEY ARRANGED A BATTALION RAID ON A GERMAN
POST SUPPOSED TO BE HELD BY NIGHT ONLY TO OCCUPY IT IF POSSIBLE
BUT THE ENEMY WERE IN OCCUPATION AND VERY READY THE LITTLE PARTY
RETURNED WITH THEIR OFFICER 2ND LIEUTENANT G C MACLACHLAN AND A
SERGEANT WOUNDED A FEW WEEKS LATER THE BATTALION WORKED OUT A MOST
SATISFACTORY LITTLE TENMINUTE RETURNRAID WITHOUT A SINGLE CASUALTY
AND SO CLEARED THEIR ACCOUNT

APRIL HAD BEEN AN INEXPENSIVE MONTH FOR BOTH MEN AND OFFICERS THE
COMMANDING OFFICER THE ASSISTANT ADJUTANT AND THE MEDICAL OFFICER
HAD AS WE KNOW BEEN SLIGHTLY GASSED AT HEADQUARTERS AND 2ND
LIEUTENANTS C L BROWNE AND MACLACHLAN WOUNDED ONLY THREE MEN HAD
BEEN KILLED AND FORTYONE WOUNDED BUT NO LESS THAN TWENTYSIX WERE
SENT DOWN SICKPROOF THAT THE STRAIN HAD TOLD

THE ENEMY SHOWED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMAGINATION UNUSUAL ON THAT
FRONT ONE OF OUR FORWARD POSTS EXPECTING THE RETURN OF A PATROL
ON THE DAWN ON THE 3RD MAY SAW A PARTY OF FIVE APPROACHING AND
CHALLENGED IRISH GUARDS WAS THE REPLY FOLLOWED BY A FEW BOMBS
WHICH DID SOME DAMAGE THIS PECULIARLY IRRITATING TRICK HAD NOT
BEEN WORKED ON THE BATTALION FOR SOME TIME AND THEY FELT ITAS
THEIR AMUSED FRIENDS TO LEFT AND RIGHT IN THE LINE TOOK CARE THAT
THEY SHOULD OTHERWISE THE ENEMY DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO MORE AND
HEAVIER GUNNERY WHICH IN A FIVEDAY TOUR CAUSED TWENTY CASUALTIES
WOUNDED AND ONE KILLED BRIGADE RESERVE CAMPS WERE OUTSIDE
MONCHYAUBOIS WHENCE TIRED MEN WERE SENT TO THE DETAILS CAMP AT
POMMIER REGULARLY BOMBED BY AEROPLANE AND FROM POMMIER WERE DRAWN
OCCASIONAL WORKINGPARTIES ONE OF THESE INCLUDED THE BATTALION
DRUMMERS AND PIPERS WHO ENJOYED WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A DAY OUT IN
SOME OLD TRENCHES

ON THE 5TH MAY LIEUTENANT KEENAN ARRIVED FROM THE 2ND BATTALION TO
TAKE OVER THE ADJUTANCY IN PLACE OF CAPTAIN GORDON WHO HAD BEEN
TRANSFERRED TO THE 2ND BATTALION AS SECOND IN COMMAND AFTER ALMOST
THREE YEARS CONTINUOUS SERVICE WITH THE 1ST BATTALION

ON THE 7TH MAY THEY WENT UP FROM MONCHY BY THE EVERHATEFUL
EVERSHELLED COJEUL VALLEY TO THE AYETTE SUBSECTOR RELIEVING THE
2ND COLDSTREAM NEXT DAY THE DEVILDIRECTED LUCK OF THE FRONT LINE
AFTER A PEACEFUL FINE NIGHT CAUSED THE ONLY TRENCHMORTAR SENT OVER
BY THE ENEMY THAT DID NOT CLEAN MISS ALL OUR POSTS TO FALL DIRECTLY
IN NO 3 POST RIGHT FRONT COMPANY NO 4 INSTANTLY KILLING CAPTAIN
BUDD MC COMMANDING THE COMPANY AND WITH HIM 2ND LIEUTENANT E
C G LORD AND SEVEN MEN CAPTAIN BUDDS ENERGY AND COOLNESS PROVED
ON MANY OCCASIONS WERE A PARTICULAR LOSS TO HIS COMRADES HE WAS A
LARGE SILENT MAN ON WHOM EVERY ONE COULD AND DID LEAN HEAVILY AT ALL
TIMES HE KNEW NO FEAR AND WAS OF THE SELFCONTAINED INTENSELY ALIVE
TYPE ALWAYS IN DANGER BUT NEVER BY HIS FRIENDS CONNECTED WITH ANY
THOUGHT OF DEATH SECOND LIEUTENANT LORD ROSY LORD WAS A KEEN AND
PROMISING YOUNG OFFICER THOSE WERE THE ONLY CASUALTIES OF THE TOUR
THEY WERE BURIED IN THE LITTLE MILITARY CEMETERY NEAR AYETTE

OUR GUNS HAD BEEN WORKING STEADILY FROM BEHIND BUT TILL THIS
TRENCHMORTAR OUTBURST MOST OF THE ENEMY REPLIES HAD BEEN DIRECTED
ON AYETTE ITSELF OR OUR SUPPORTLINES

THE SHELLING THROUGHOUT THE MONTH GREW MORE AND MORE EARNEST AND OUR
REPLIES ROARING OVERHEAD WORRIED THE DEADTIRED SOLDIERY THE WORK
WAS ALL AT NIGHTWIRING AND IMPROVING POSTS AND UNLIMITED DIGGING
OF COMMUNICATIONWAYS BETWEEN THEM FOR WHETHER A TRENCHLINE HELD
TILL CHRISTMAS WENT UP BODILY NEXT MINUTE OR WAS BATTERED DOWN
EVERY HOUR IN THE MAKING THERE WAS BUT ONE STANDARD OF WORK THAT
BESEEMED THE BATTALION AND THOUGH DIVISIONAL COMMANDERS MIGHT AND
AS ON THE DREARY SCARPE POSTS DID DRAW GRATIFIED COMMANDING OFFICERS
ASIDE AND TELL THEM THAT FOR QUANTITY AND QUALITY THEIR TRENCHCRAFT
EXCELLED THAT OF OTHER BATTALIONS THE BATTALION ITSELF WAS NEVER
QUITE CONTENTED WITH WHAT IT HAD ACCOMPLISHED

THEIR NEXT TURNMAY 16 TO 21WAS FINE AND HOT FOR A COUPLE OF
MORNINGS AND REGULAR BARRAGES WERE PUT DOWN ON THE SUPPORTLINE WHEN
THEY WERE STANDINGTO FOUR MEN WERE KILLED AND THIRTEEN OF WHOM TWO
DIED LATER WERE WOUNDED

THEY WERE HEAVILY SHELLED IN BRIGADERESERVE CAMP ON THE NIGHT OF
THE 24TH FOUR OFFICERSCAPTAIN BENCEJONES LIEUTENANTS RILEY AND
BULLER AND 2ND LIEUTENANT BARRYWOUNDED ONE OTHER RANK KILLED AND
FIVE WOUNDED

WHEN THEY WENT UP TO RELIEVE THE 2ND COLDSTREAM ON THE 25TH MAY
THEY WERE CAUGHT IN PLATOONORDER AT THE CORNER OF ADINFER WOOD A
PLACE OF NO GOOD NAME TO MARCHING TROOPS AND LIEUTENANT WILLIAMS WAS
SLIGHTLY WOUNDED THREEQUARTERS OF AN HOURS INTENSE BARRAGE WAS PUT
DOWN ON FRONT AND SUPPORT LINES AS SOON AS THEY WERE FAIRLY IN
CAUSING SEVERAL CASUALTIES

THE DAWN OF THE 28TH MAY BEGAN WITH ANOTHER SHARP BARRAGE ON THE
FRONT LINE AND THE DINNERHOUR WAS A CONTINUOUS BARRAGE OF 59S AND
42S DIRECTED AT BATTALION HEADQUARTERS THEY WERE MISSED BUT A
DIRECT HIT WAS MADE ON AN AIDPOST OF THE 2ND GRENADIERS LESS THAN A
HUNDRED YARDS OFF ON OUR LEFT AS A DISTRACTION ORDERS CAME IN FROM
BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS THE SAME MORNING THAT THE BATTALION WOULD CARRY
OUT A RAID ON ONE OF THE ENEMYS POSTS IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT COMPANY
THEY WERE GIVEN THEIR CHOICE IT WOULD SEEM OF TWOONE WITHOUT
ARTILLERYHELP AND BY DAY THE OTHER WITH AN ARTILLERYBACKING AND
BY NIGHT THE SECOND IN COMMAND MAJOR R BAGGALLAY ELECTED FOR
WORKS OF DARKNESSOR AS NEAR AS MIGHT BE IN SPITE OF A DISGUSTINGLY
BRIGHT MOON LIEUTENANT C S OBRIEN WAS DETAILED TO COMMAND WITH
SERGEANT REGAN A FORCEFUL MAN AS SERGEANT ONLY TWENTYNINE HANDS
WERE REQUIRED AND THEREFORE SIXTY VOLUNTEERED MOVED TO THIS NOT
BY PARTICULAR THIRST FOR GLORY OF WHICH THE TRENCHES SOON CURE
MEN AS BY HUMAN DESIRE TO ESCAPE MONOTONY PUNCTUATED WITH SHELLS
EXTRA RUMRATIONS TOO ATTACH TO EXTRA DUTIES AS A RAID IT WAS A
SMALL AFFAIR BUT AS A WORK OF ART HISTORICALLY WORTH RECORDING
IN SOME DETAIL F BATTERY RHA AND 400 BATTERY RFA SUPPLIED
THE LIFTING BARRAGES WHICH DULY CUT THE POST OFF FROM SUCCOUR
WHILE STANDINGBARRAGES OF 18POUNDERS A BARRAGE OF 45S HOWS
AND GROUPS FIRING CONCENTRATIONS AT LEFT AND RIGHT ENEMY TRENCHES
COMPLETED THE BOXED TRAP IN THE FEW MINUTES THE AFFAIR LASTED IT
IS NOT EXTRAVAGANT TO ESTIMATE THAT MORE STUFF WAS EXPENDED THAN THE
WHOLE OF OUR FRONT IN 1914 WAS ALLOWED TO SEND OVER IN TWO DAYS

THE POST HAD BEEN RECONNOITRED EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND WAS KNOWN
NOT TO BE WIRED ALL THE RAIDERS WITH BLACKENED FACES AND BAYONETS
AND STRIPPED UNIFORMS THAT BETRAYED NOTHING WERE IN POSITION ON THE
FORMINGUP TAPE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE ZERO THE MOON FORCED THEM TO
CRAWL UNDIGNIFIEDLY OUT IN TWOS AND THREES BUT THEY LINED UP WITH
THE PRECISION OF A FOOTBALL LINE AT ONEYARD INTERVALS AND A MINUTE
BEFORE ZERO WRIGGLED TO WITHIN SEVENTY YARDS OF THEIR QUARRY AT
ZERO THE BARRAGE CAME DOWN BURSTING BEAUTIFULLY JUST BEYOND THE
ENEMY POST AND ABOUT TWO SECONDS ERE IT LIFTED THE RAIDERS CHARGED
IN NO ONE HAD TIME TO LEAVE OR EVEN TO MAKE A SHOW OF RESISTANCE
AND THEY WERE BACK WITH THEIR FIVE PRISONERS ALL ALIVE AND QUITE
IDENTIFIABLE IN TEN MINUTES THE WAITING STRETCHERPARTIES WERE NOT
NEEDED ANDBEST OF ALLRETALIATION WAS SLIGHT AND ENTIRELY ON
AYETTE ONE IS NOT TOLD WHAT AYETTE THOUGHT OF IT THE MOTIVE OF
THE RAID WAS TO SECURE IDENTITY ALIVE OR DEAD BUT WHEN ALL WAS
OVER WITHOUT HURT ONE SINGLE SHELL AT MORNING STANDTO MAY 28
KILLED 2ND LIEUTENANT L H L CARVER IN A FRONTLINE TRENCH

THEY HELD THE RAIDED POST UNDER CLOSE OBSERVATION THAT DAY AND THE
NEXT MAY 29 AND DISCOVERED THAT IT HAD BEEN REOCCUPIED BY A
MACHINEGUN PARTY AS THEY PARTICULARLY DID NOT WISH IT TO PUT OUT
WIRE OR BECOME OFFENSIVE THEY DOSED IT WITH CONSTANT BURSTS OF THEIR
OWN MACHINEGUN AND WERE REWARDED BY HEARING GROANS AND CRIES AND
OUR LISTENINGPATROL IN NO MANS LAND SAW A MAN BEING CARRIED AWAY

ON THE 31ST MAY THE ENEMY SET TO IN EARNEST TO SHELL ALL
RESERVELINES AND BACKAREA FOR SIX HOURS AS WELL AS THE FIRSTLINE
TRANSPORT IN ADINFER WOOD AFTER DARK WHEN WOUNDED HORSES ARE NOT
EASY TO HANDLE THEIR RELIEF BY THE 2ND GRENADIERS WAS BADLY DELAYED
BY HEAVY SHELLING ALL THE WAY FROM THE FRONT LINE TO MONCHY BUT
INSTEAD OF ANY NUMBER OF CASUALTIES WHICH MIGHT REASONABLY HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED THE BATTALION GOT THROUGH UNSCATHED

THE MONTHS LIST WAS HEAVY ENOUGH AS IT STOOD FIVE OFFICERS HAD BEEN
WOUNDED AND THREE KILLED IN ACTION SEVENTEEN OTHER RANKS KILLED
AND FORTYEIGHT WOUNDED AND ALL THIS IN THE REGULAR WEARANDTEAR
FRONTLINE ROUTINE WITH NOTHING MORE TO SEE THAN A STRAY GERMAN CAP
HERE AND THERE TWENTYTWO MEN WERE SENT DOWN SICK AND THE DIARY
BEGINS TO HINT AT THE PREVALENCE OF THE SPANISH FEVER WHICH WAS IN
A FEW MONTHS TO SWEEP FRANCE AND ALL THE WORLD

JUNE WAS A MONTH OF PEACE IT OPENED IN RESERVETRENCHES AT THE
SOUTHWEST END OF MONCHYAUBOIS AND WHEN THEY NEXT WENT UP INTO
LINE A NEW ROUTE HAD BEEN SURVEYED ROUND THE DREADED CORNER OF
ADINFER WOOD WHICH SAVED SOME SHELLING OF RELIEFS

ON THE 4TH JUNE THE CO LIEUTENANTCOLONEL POLLOK LEFT THE
BATTALION TO TAKE OVER COMMAND OF SIXTH CORPS ARMY SCHOOL AND MAJOR
R R C BAGGALLAY ASSUMED COMMAND LIKEWISE THREE STRAY GERMANS WERE
CAPTURED OPPOSITE ONE OF OUR POSTS

ON THE 5TH MAJOR GORDON ARRIVED FROM THE 2ND BATTALION FOR DUTY AS
SECOND IN COMMAND

THEY WERE RELIEVED BY THE 1ST KINGS REGIMENT ON THE 6TH JUNEA
SOMEWHAT HECTIC PERFORMANCE AS THE FRONTLINE TRACKWAYS WERE
INTRICATE NEEDING GUIDES AT ALMOST EVERY TURN OF THEM AND FOR
THE RUNUP ONE GUIDE PER PLATOON AFTER WHICH ABOUT ONE IN THE
MORNING IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE KINGS HAD COME IN WITHOUT THEIR
LEWISGUNS SOME DIVISIONS WERE IN THE HABIT OF LEAVING AND TAKING
OVER THE LEWISGUNS IN SITU BUT THE GUARDS DIVISION ALWAYS WENT
IN AND OUT OF THE LINE WITH THEIR VERY OWN WEAPONS ONE CANNOT
DELAY A CLEAR JUNE DAWN AND AS THE RELIEVED BATTALION HAD TO GET
OFF IN TIGHTLY PACKED AND HORRIBLY CONSPICUOUS LORRIES AND AS THE
LAST PLATOON COULD NOT REACH THOSE LORRIES TILL 3 A M IT WAS
TOUCHANDGO WHETHER DAYLIGHT WOULD NOT REVEAL THEM LIKE A SUNDAY
SCHOOL TREAT TO THE GERMAN GUNS BUT LUCK HELD THE LAST LORRY WAS
SAFE IN BAVINCOURT WOOD FIVE MILES BEHIND MONCHY BEFORE DAY HAD
STRIPPED THE LANDSCAPE AND THE 1ST KINGS WERE LEFT TO MEDITATE ON
THE WEALTH AND VARIETY OF THE IRISH TONGUE AS DELIVERED ON EMPTY
STOMACHS IN WHISPERS DOWN PACKED TRENCHES

THE BATTALION BILLETED AT BAVINCOURT WHEN THE 2ND HLI HAD GOT OUT
OF THEIR QUARTERS AND SINCE LIKE THE OTHER CAMPS BAVINCOURT WAS
REGULARLY BOMBED MADE EARTH WALLS ROUND THEIR NISSEN HUTS AND SLITS
NEAR THEM TO BE USED AGAINST PLANES OR TOO EXTRAVAGANT SHELLFIRE
HERE THEY STAYED TILL THE END OF THE MONTH CLEANING REFITTING AND
TRAINING IN OPEN WARFARE PRINCIPALLY AND THIS TIME THEY WERE NOT
TO BE DISAPPOINTED AT LEWIS GUNNERY BOMBING AND GENERAL PHYSICAL
SMARTENINGUP WHEN THE BRIGADE SPORTS TOOK PLACE AT SAULTY THEY WON
EVERY EVENT BUT THREE AND WHEN THE CORPS COMMANDER THE FOLLOWING
WEEK INSPECTED THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE DIVISIONAL METHODS OF
CARRYING THE EIGHT LEWISGUNS OF EACH COMPANY ALL ON ONE LIMBER THE
METHOD EMPLOYED BY THE BATTALION WAS CONSIDERED THE BEST AND ALL
UNITS WERE ORDERED TO COPY THEY HAD RIGGED A SORT OF FALSE TOP ON
A REARLIMBER WHICH ACCOMMODATED ALL EIGHT GUNS TOGETHER

A DIVISIONAL HORSESHOW WAS HELD ON THE 22ND BUT THERE THE BATTALION
DID NOT GET A SINGLE PRIZE THEY HAMMERED ON AT THEIR TRAININGS AND
BRIGADE FIELDDAYSALL WITH AN EYE TO THE COMING OPEN WARFARE WHILE
THE SPANISH FEVER WHICH WAS INFLUENZA OF THE POSTWAR TYPE GREW
STEADILY WORSE AMONG MEN AND OFFICERS ALIKE WHEN HRH THE DUKE
OF CONNAUGHT VISITED DIVISIONAL HEADQUARTERS AT BAVINCOURT CHTEAU
ON THE 30TH JUNE AND THE BATTALION HAD TO FIND NOT ONLY THE GUARD
OF HONOUR BUT 160 MEN TO LINE THE AVENUE TO THE CHTEAU THERE WERE
SEVENTY OFFICERS AND MEN DOWN WITH THE PEST OUT OF LESS THAN 900
THIRTYONE MEN HAD BEEN SENT DOWN SICK TWO HAD BEEN KILLED IN ACTION
PRESUMABLY BY OVERHEAD BOMBING FOR THE DIARY DOES NOT MENTION ANY
TRENCH CASUALTIES AND TWENTYTHREE WOUNDED

THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS JOINED DURING THE MONTH OF JUNE LIEUTENANT C
A J VERNON AND 2ND LIEUTENANTS E B SPAFFORD A E HUTCHINSON
H R BALDWIN G F MATHIESON J A M FARADAY E M HARVEY MC
AND A E OCONNOR ALL ON THE 2ND JUNE CAPTAIN A W L PAGET ON
THE 4TH AND 2ND LIEUTENANT A H OFARRELL ON THE 10TH JUNE SECOND
LIEUTENANT C S OBRIEN WHO WAS IN COMMAND OF THE MODEL RAID
ALREADY MENTIONED WAS AWARDED THE MILITARY CROSS ON THE 9TH OF JUNE

AFTER A SPORTING INTERLUDE ON THE 3RD JULY WHEN THEY MET THE 1ST
MUNSTER FUSILIERS AT ATHLETICS AND WON EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE HUNDRED
YARDS THEY RELIEVED THE 15TH HLI IN THE INTERMEDIATE LINE NEAR
HENDECOURT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE A SICK PEOPLE JUST THEN
ALL BATTALION HEADQUARTERS EXCEPT THE COMMANDING OFFICER AND ALL THE
OFFICERS OF NO 2 COMPANY BESIDES OFFICERS OF OTHER COMPANIES WERE
DOWN WITH SPANISH FEVER ON GOING INTO THE LINE A THIRD OF THE MEN
WERE ALSO SICK AT ONE TIME AND APPARENTLY THE ENEMY TOO FOR THEY
HARDLY TROUBLED TO SHELL BY DAY AND LET THE NIGHTRELIEFS GO WITHOUT
ATTENTION THE ONLY DRAWBACKS WERE FURIOUS SUMMER THUNDERSTORMS
WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME FLOODED THE TRENCHES AND WOKE UP MORE
FEVER THE FRONT LINE HELD HERE BY THE GUARDS WAS BADLY KNOCKED ABOUT
AND BATTERED AND INSTRUCTIONS RAN THAT IN EVENT OF SERIOUS ATTACK
IT WOULD NOT BE CONTESTED

THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE STATE OF THE BATTALIONS COLLECTIVE
MIND AT THIS TIME BUT FROM HOME LETTERS IT MIGHT BE GATHERED THAT
THE STRAIN OF THE BUSH AND ITS BEWILDERMENT HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE
IDEA THAT GREAT THINGS WERE PREPARING BATTALIONS ARE VERY OFTEN
TOLD TALES TO THIS EFFECT BUT THEY SUIT THEMSELVES AS TO THE AMOUNT
THAT THEY SWALLOW NO POWER ON EARTH FOR INSTANCE COULD HAVE
PERSUADED THE VETERANS OF THE SOMME AFTER CAMBRAI THAT THERE WAS
ANYTHING DOING BUT AS THE SUMMER OF 1918 GREW WARMER IN THE WOODED
AND ORCHARD COUNTRY BEHIND THE AMIENSALBERT LINE AND OUR LINES
THERE HELD AND WERE STRENGTHENED AND THOSE WHO HAD BEEN HOME OR
ON THE SEAS REPORTED WHAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN HOPE OF A KIND
NOT RAISED BEFORE GREW IN THE TALKS OF THE MEN AND THE OFFICERS
UNDERSTAND I DO NOT SAY THERE WAS ANNY OF THE OLD CHAT REGARDIN
THAT THE WAR WOULD FINISH NEXT CHUSEDAY THE WAY WE TALKED IN 16
BUT WHATEVER THEY SAID ACROST THE WATER WE DID NOT HOULD TWOULD
ENDURE THOSE TWO MORE EXTRA YEARS ALL THEM CIVILIANS WAS DISHIN OUT
TO US WHAT DID WE THINK THAT 19 WOULD SEE THE FINISH TWUD BE
HARD TO TELL WHAT WE THOUGHT LEAVE IT THIS WAYWE WAS NO MORE THAN
WAITIN ON MERCIES TO HAPPEN ANTWAS MERICLES THAT TRANSPIRED

THEY RELIEVED THEIR OWN BRIGADE BATTALIONS WITH THE PUNCTILIO PROPER
TO THEIR COMMON RITUAL AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF OVER A HUNDRED
RECRUITS IT WAS THEIR ANCIENT COMRADES UNDER ALL SORTS OF TERRORS
THE 2ND COLDSTREAM WHOSE GUIDES FROM BOIRYST MARTIN ONE NIGHT LOST
THEIR WAY IN THE MAZE OF TRACKS AND TURNS TO THE FRONT LINE BUT AS
MEEKLY SET FORTH IN THE DIARY WHEN IT CAME THE BATTALIONS TURN TO
BE RELIEVED BY THE 2ND GRENADIERS ALL TRACKS HAD BEEN CAREFULLY
PICKETED BY THIS BATTALION TO ASSIST GRENADIER COMPANIES COMING IN
AND OURS GOING OUT THE OCCASIONS WHEN THE GUIDES OF THE 1ST IRISH
GUARDS LOST THEIR WAY MUST BE LOOKED FOR IN THE REPORTS OF OTHERS

LITTLE SHELLING AND NO CASUALTIES WERE THE ORDER OF THE FINE DAYS
TILL ON THE 29TH JULY TAKING OVER FROM THE 2ND COLDSTREAM THEY
FOUND SIX PLATOONS OF THE 3RD BATTALION 320TH REGIMENT USA
WHICH HAD COME INTO LINE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND WERE ATTACHED FOR
INSTRUCTION THESE WERE YOUNG KEEN DESPERATELY ANXIOUS TO LEARN
AND NOT AT ALL DISPOSED TO KEEP THEIR HEADS DOWN

NEXT DAY THE ENEMY OPENED ON THEM AND WERE RATHER OFFENSIVE IN
THEIR SHELLING THE FRONT PLATOON OF THE AMERICANS ATTACHED TO
THE BATTALIONS FRONT COMPANY CAUGHT IT WORST BUT NO CASUALTIES
WERE REPORTED THEN THINGS QUIETED DOWN AND A PATROL OF SPECIAL
BATTALION SCOUTS A NEW ORGANIZATION OF OLD TRUSTY NO MANS
LANDERS UNDER LIEUTENANT VERNON AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WENT OUT
ON RECONNAISSANCE ACROSS THE COJEUL VALLEY AND WANDERED GENERALLY
AMONG ANCIENT TRENCHLINES IN BRIGHT MOONLIGHT THEY FOUND A GERMAN
PARTY WORKING ON FRESH EARTH BUT NO SIGNS OF ENEMY PATROLS ON THE
MOVE IN THE VALLEY THIS WAS AS WELL NO ONE WISHED TO SEE THAT DEAD
GROUND OCCUPIED EXCEPT BY OUR OWN PEOPLE AT THE PROPER TIME

JULYS BILL OF CASUALTIES WAS THE LOWEST OF ALL NO OFFICER AND
BUT ONE MAN HAD BEEN KILLED AND TWO WOUNDED THIS LAST WAS WHEN
THE ENEMY SHELLED BOIRY TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF THE AMERICAN
PLATOONS SEVENTEEN MEN WERE SENT DOWN SICK FIFTY OTHER RANKS WERE
TRANSFERRED TO THE 1ST FROM THE 2ND BATTALION NOW ACTING AS A FEEDER
TO ITS ELDER BROTHER

ON THE 1ST OF AUGUST THE BATTALION WAS STILL IN THE PEACEFUL FRONT
LINE WATCHING THE SIX AMERICAN PLATOONS BEING RELIEVED BY OTHER
SIX PLATOONS FROM THE 2ND BATTALION OF THE 320TH REGIMENT IT WAS
OBSERVED NOT WITHOUT SOME ENVYTHEY DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH TO SAVE
EMSELVES THROUBLE AN THEY WOULD NOT HA DONE IT IF THEY HAD THEY
WAS TOO FULL OF THIS SAME DAM NEW OULD WAR EVEN AT THIS IMMENSE
DISTANCE OF TIME ONE CAN ALMOST HEAR THE VETERANS COMMENTING ON THE
ZEAL AND EXCITEMENT THAT FILLED THE STALE LINES WHERE TO THOSE
YOUNG EYES FROM ACROSS THE WATER EVERYTHING WAS AS SHININGNEW AS
DEATH

ON THE 3RD AUGUST THE BATTALION MADE A RECONNAISSANCE OF A
POST WITH THE IDEA OF RAIDING IT WHICH WAS A COMPLETE THOUGH
BLOODLESS FAILURE SOME OF OUR BACK GUNS CHOSE THE EXACT MOMENT
WHEN THE RAIDERS WERE SETTING OUT ON THE SURE INFORMATION OF A
SCOUTINGPARTY WHO HAD JUST COME IN TO WIPE UP THE UNCONSCIOUS
LITTLE GARRISON AND THEIR MACHINEGUN AND WOKE THE NIGHT WITH HEAVY
SHELL DROPPED IN OUR OWN WIRE AND IN FRONT OF OUR OBJECTIVE
NATURALLY NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND THE AFFAIR WAS CALLED OFF
TILL THE NEXT EVENING 4TH AUGUST WHEN A CRAWLINGPARTY UNDER
LIEUTENANT VERNON OF A CORPORAL AND SIX MEN WENT OUT ALONG THE SAME
ROUTE THAT THE SCOUTS HAD TAKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY WERE EXPECTED
AND WELCOMED WITH ENTHUSIASM A SENTRY GAVE THE ALARM A LITTLE PARTY
RAN OUT TO CUT THEM OFF THE MACHINEGUN A HEAVY ONE WHICH HAD NOT
BETRAYED ITSELF BEFORE PROMPTLY OPENED FIRE BUT WIDE OF OUR PRONE
MEN AND A GERMAN AS PROMPTLY HOVE BOMBS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
ALL THIS SAYS THE REPORT HAPPENED AS SOON AS SOME ONE INSIDE THE
POST GAVE SHORT DECISIVE ORDERS THEN VRY LIGHTS FLARED WITHOUT
STINT AND BEING SOME WAY FROM HOME WITH MUCH UNLOCATED WIRE
BETWEEN THE RAIDERS GOT AWAY SWIFTLY AND SAFELY THE TRACKS OF THE
SCOUTS THROUGH THE LONG GRASS THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD PUT THE ENEMY
ON THE ALERT BUT IF OUR GUNS HAD ONLY HELD THEIR TONGUES ON THAT
OCCASION OUR COUP MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OFF INSTEAD OF WHICH THE
ENEMY WOKE UP AND SHELLED A FRONT COMPANY FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
WITH 60POUNDERS BEFORE HE COULD BE INDUCED TO GO TO BED


THE BEGINNINGS OF THE END

BUT ALL THIS WAS AS LIGHT CASUAL AND UNRELATED AS THE THROWING
OF THE BALL FROM HAND TO HAND THAT FILLS TIME BEFORE AN INNINGS
AND BY THE LATTER PART OF JULY MEN BEGAN HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO
SPECULATE WHEN OUR INNINGS WOULD BEGIN IN THE NORTH THE ENEMY
CROWDED INTO THE LYS SALIENT WHICH THEY HAD BEEN AT SUCH PAINS TO
HACK OUT OVER THE BODIES OF THE 2ND BATTALION WERE ENJOYING SOME
OF THE PLEASURES OUR MEN HAD TASTED ROUND YPRES FOR SO MANY YEARS
OUR GATHERING GUNS CROSSPLOUGHING THEM WHERE THEY LAY TOOK FRESH
TOLL OF EACH NEW GERMAN DIVISION ARRIVING TO MAKE GOOD THE WASTAGE
IN THE SOUTH OUTSIDE AMIENS THE AUSTRALIANS AN IMPENITENT AND
UNIMPRESSIONABLE BREED HAD ON THE 4TH OF JULY WITH THE HELP OF
FOUR COMPANIES OF THE THIRTYTHIRD AMERICAN DIVISION AND SIXTY
TANKS GONE ARAIDING ROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HAMEL AND VAIRE
WOOD WITH RESULTS THAT SURPRISED EVERYBODY EXCEPT THEMSELVES THEY
DID NOT GREATLY RESPECT THE ENEMY AND HANDLED HIM RUDELY MEANTIME
AMIENS RAKED OVER BY AEROPLANES ALMOST EVERY HOUR WAS BEING WRECKED
AND STRANGLED AND ALL THE LABOUR CORPS WHICH FROM THE SOLDIERS
POINT OF VIEW COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED IN SAVING POOR PRIVATES
CRUEL FATIGUES WERE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT AT RAILWAY DIVERSIONS AND
DOUBLINGS THAT BY SOME ROUTE OR ANOTHER SHOULD BRING THE URGENT
SUPPLIES OF BOTH FRENCH AND BRITISH ARMIES TO THEIR DESTINATIONS
MEN ARGUED THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST JOB TO BE TAKEN IN HAND
WOULD BE THE DELIVERANCE OF AMIENS THERE WAS TALK TOO THAT ALL
FRENCH DIVISIONS IN FLANDERS WERE WITHDRAWN AND CONCENTRATED BEHIND
AMIENS CITY THIS MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A SIGN THAT THE LYS SALIENT
WAS RECKONED REASONABLY SECURE AND AS CONFIRMING THE BELIEF THAT
UPON THE LYS ALSO WE HAD ABUNDANCE OF ARTILLERY ON THE OTHER
HAND THESE ARE BUT A FEW OF THE RUMOURS OF THE TIME AWAY IN THE
UNKNOWN SOUTHEAST OF FRANCE WHERE FEW BRITISH TROOPS HAD PENETRATED
IN THE MEMORY OF PRESENT FIGHTING MEN SOME FIVE OR SIX DIVISIONS
MAKING THE NINTH BRITISH CORPS HAD BEEN SENT FOR A REST AFTER THE
MARCH PUSH AND HAD BEEN BADLY MAULED BY A SUDDEN SURPRISEATTACK
ON THE AISNE WHERE TOGETHER WITH THE FIFTH FRENCH ARMY THEY HAD
BEEN DRIVEN BACK TOWARDS THE MARNE WHICH ALL THE WORLD THOUGHT WAS
A RIVER AND A BATTLE LONG SINCE DISPOSED OF THE ENEMY THERE WERE
SITTING PRACTICALLY OUTSIDE THE FOREST OF VILLERSCOTTERTS A NAME
ALSO BELONGING TO ANCIENT HISTORY MUCHENDURING MEN WHOM FATE
TILL NOW HAD SPARED RECOUNTED HOW THE 4TH GUARDS BRIGADE AS IT
WAS THEN HAD FIRST CAUGHT IT THERE AMONG THE BEECHTREES VERY
NEARLY FOUR YEARS BACK MOREOVER THERE WAS FRESH TROUBLE BETWEEN
MONTDIDIER AND NOYON WHERE THE ENEMY WERE AGAIN THROWING THEMSELVES
AT THE FRENCH THEN TOO FOCH WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF ALL BUT WHO SO
FAR HAD MADE NO SIGN HAD BORROWED FOUR MORE OF OUR DIVISIONSTHE
WHOLE OF THE TWENTYSECOND CORPS THIS TIMEAND THEY WERE OFF ON SOME
FRENCH FRONT HEAVEN AND HEADQUARTERS ALONE KNEW WHERE LIKEWISE ONE
COMPOSITE SCRUM OF FRENCH AMERICAN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN TROOPS
WAS HOLDING IT MIGHT BE HOPED A GERMAN CAPITAL ATTACK NEAR RHEIMS
THE OLD WARLINE THAT IN THE REMOTE DAYS OF WINTER WOULD HAVE CALLED
ITSELF THE SOMME FRONT DISCUSSED AND DIGESTED THESE NEWS AND MANY
MORE THERE WAS NOTHING DOING ON THEIR BEAT TO WRITE HOME ABOUT
EVEN WERE THEY ALLOWED TO DO SO THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER THEY WOULD
BE CALLED ON TO REPAIR TO THE LYS AND FREE HAZEBROUCK WHICH WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY STILL IN A DANGEROUS POSITION OR STAND STILL AND AWAIT
WHAT MIGHT BEFALL AT AMIENS THERE WAS NO LIMIT TO SPECULATION AND
ARGUMENT ANY MORE THAN THERE HAD BEEN WHEN THE SOMME FRONT WENT IN
MARCH AND THE MORE THEY ARGUED THE MORE CONFUSED MEN GREW OVER THE
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT WAS SUPPLIED THEM THEM GENRALS AND
THEIR STAFFS MUST HA DONE QUITE A LITTLE LYINEVEN FOR THEM THEY
HAD US BELIEVIN THEIR WORD IVE HEARD SINCE EVEN JERRY BELIEVED
EM

THAT WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN THE TROUBLE WITH THE ENEMY IT WAS
EVIDENT TO THE MOST HARDENED PESSIMIST THAT A FRENCH COUNTERATTACK
LAUNCHED OUT OF THE VILLERSCOTTERTS FORESTS TO BEGIN WITH AND
IN SEVERAL OTHER PLACES AT APPARENTLY THE SAME TIME WAS NOT
THE FLASHINTHEPAN THAT SOME PEOPLE FORETOLD FOR THE SECOND TIME
THE ENEMY WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE MARNE AND UNDER PRESSURE
CONTINUING HIS WITHDRAWAL HIS GREAT ATTACK NEAR RHEIMS TOO SEEMED
TO HAVE STUCK ON THE LYS FROM TIME TO TIME SITES OF VILLAGES WITH
WELLREMEMBERED NAMES WERE OCCASIONALLY RETURNING TO THEIR LAWFUL
TRUSTEES HOPEFUL STUDENTS OF THE WAR HINTED THAT WITH FRESH TROOPS
IN VAST NUMBERS MORE GUNS AND A SHARE OF LUCK 1918 MIGHT SEE THE
FOUNDATIONS LAID FOR A REALLY EFFECTIVE FINISH IN 1919 A REPORT
HAD COME UP FROM THE SOUTH THAT THE FRENCH DOWN AMIENS WAY HAD MADE
AN EXPERIMENTAL ATTACK OR RATHER A BIG RAID ON THE ENEMY AND HAD
FOUND HIM THERE CURIOUSLY SOFT AND WILLING TO SHIFT

THE AIR THICKENED WITH LIES AS THE MEN WHO MOVED ABOUT THE EARTH
BY NIGHT OR UNDER COVER INCREASED AND OUR AIRCRAFT WERE TOLD OFF
TO CIRCLE LOW AND NOISILY AT CERTAIN POINTS AND DROWN THE CHURN OF
MANY TANKS TRAILING UP INTO THEIR APPOINTED AREAS ALL THE CANADIAN
DIVISIONS MEN SAID WERE MOVING OFF TO RECAPTURE KEMMEL HILL ALL
OUR FORCES ROUND AMIENS WERE DIGGING THEMSELVES IN SAID OTHERS
PREPARATORY TO A WAITANDSEE CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD SURELY LAST TILL
CHRISTMAS FOR PROOF IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT OUR GUNS IN THAT SECTOR
WERE DOING NOTHING AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE REGISTERING ON THE
SLY EVERYBODY ROUND AMIENS A THIRD PARTY INSISTED WOULD BE SENT
OFF IN A DAY OR TWO TO HELP THE FRENCH IN CHAMPAGNE THE WEAKNESSES
OF HUMAN NATURE IN POSSESSION OF EXCLUSIVE INFORMATION PLAYED INTO
THE HANDS OF THE VERY FEW WHO KNEW AND YOUNG STAFF OFFICERS OF
INNOCENT APPEARANCE INFERNALLY BAMBOOZLED THEIR BETTERS

SO IT HAPPENED ON THE 4TH AUGUST ON A MISTY DAWN THAT THE FOURTH
ARMY RAWLINSONS WITH FOUR HUNDRED TANKS BACKED BY TWO THOUSAND
GUNS AND COVERED BY AEROPLANES TO A NUMBER NOT YET CONCEIVED IN
WAR DECLARED ITSELF AS IN BEING ROUND AMIENS AT THE VERY NOSE OF
THE GREAT GERMAN SALIENT IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS THAT ATTACK HAD
BITTEN IN FIVE MILES ON AN ELEVENMILE FRONT HAD TAKEN TWELVE
THOUSAND PRISONERS AND SOME THREE HUNDRED GUNS AND WAS WELL SET TO
CONTINUE AT THE SAME TIME THE FRENCH STRIKING UP FROM THE SOUTH
HAD CLEARED THEIR FRONT UP TO THE AMIENSROYE ROAD FROM PIERREPONT
THROUGH PLESSIER TO FRESNOY AND HAD TAKEN OVER THREE THOUSAND
PRISONERS AND MANY GUNS CAUGHT THUS ON TWO FRONTS THE ENEMY FELL
BACK ABANDONING STORES AND BURNING DUMPS WHICH LATTER SIGHT IT
CHEERED OUR MEN TO WATCH BUT THE WORK AND THE HONOUR OF THE DAY AS
OF THE FOURTH ARMYS CAMPAIGN FROM THIS POINT ON RESTED WITH THE
CANADIAN AND AUSTRALIAN DIVISIONS WHO MADE UP THE LARGER PART OF IT
THE AUSTRALIANS SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY DESCRIBES IN HIS MONUMENTAL
STORY OF THE FOURTH ARMY AS ALWAYS INQUISITIVE AND SELDOM IDLE
THE CANADIANS HAD EXACTLY THE SAME FAILINGS AND BETWEEN THE TWO
DOMINIONS THE ENEMY SUFFERED BY THE 12TH AUGUST HE HAD BEEN FORCED
BACK ON TO THE EDGE OF THE USED DESOLATE AND EATENUP COUNTRY WHERE
HE HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN 1916A JUNGLE OF OLD WIRE WRECKED
BUILDINGS CHARRED WOODS AND WILDERNESSES OF TRENCH IT WAS IDEAL
GROUND FOR MACHINEGUN DEFENCE WITH GOOD PROTECTION AGAINST TANKS
AND CAVALRY THERE HE WENT TO EARTH AND THERE AFTER A LITTLE
FEELING ALONG HIS LINE WAS HE LEFT WHILE THE SCREW WAS APPLIED
ELSEWHERE OUR FRONT AT THAT TIME RAN FROM BRAYSURSOMME DUE SOUTH
TO ANDECHY WHERE WE JOINED THE FRENCH ALMOST WITHIN MACHINEGUN
RANGE OF ROYE

NORTH OF BRAY TO THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE TOWN OF ALBERT THE LEFT
WING OF THE FOURTH ARMY HAD THE ENEMY HELD WORRIED AND EXPECTANT
NOW WAS THE THIRD ARMYS TURN TO DRIVE IN THE WEDGE FROM NORTH OF
ALBERT UP THE LINE TO ARRAS WHERE THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST ARMY WOULD
ASSIST WHAT HEADQUARTERS KNEW OF THE ENEMYS MORALE ON THAT SECTOR
WAS HIGHLY SATISFACTORY MOREOVER HE WAS WITHDRAWING OUT OF HIS LYS
SALIENT AS HIS DIVISIONS WERE SUCKED DOWN SOUTH TO MAKE UP WASTAGE
THERE BUT OUR MEN STILL EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD TRAMP THEIR WEARY
WAY BACK ACROSS EVERY YARD OF THEIR BATTLEFIELDS AND BURIALGROUNDS
OF THE PAST TWO YEARS FINISHING UP IF LUCK HELD SOMEWHERE ROUND
THE HINDENBURG LINE BY CHRISTMAS THAT THE WAVE ONCE LAUNCHED WOULD
CARRY TO THE RHINE WAS BEYOND THE WILDEST DREAMS

THE BATTALION AFTER THEIR LITTLE RAID ALREADY MENTIONED HAD SPENT
FROM THE 5TH TO THE 9TH AUGUST IN RESERVETRENCHES AT RANSART DOING
MUSKETRY AND ROUTEMARCHING THEY RETURNED TO THE SUPPORTTRENCHES AT
HENDECOURTLESRANSART RELIEVING THE 2ND COLDSTREAM AND STAYED THERE
TILL THE 16TH AUGUST WHEN THEY RELIEVED THE SAME BATTALION IN THE
FRONT LINE OPPOSITE BOIRYST MARTIN

THEY HAD TO PATROL THE NO MANS LAND IN FRONT OF THEM A GOOD DEAL
AT NIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD LATER BE THEIR FORMINGUP AREA BUT
SUFFERED NOTHING WORSE THAN THE USUAL SHELLING AND TRENCHMORTARING
AND THEIR SHARE IN THE WORK OF THE OPENING DAY AUGUST 21 WAS SMALL
AND SIMPLE AT 5 A M THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE ON OUR RIGHT ATTACKED
MOYENVILLE WITH THEIR OBJECTIVE JUST EAST OF THE RAILWAY THE 1ST
COLDSTREAM WAS NEXT ON OUR RIGHT THERE WAS A THICK FOG WHEN THE
BARRAGE OPENED AS WELL AS A SMOKE BARRAGE THE TANKS FORMING UP MADE
NOISE ENOUGH TO WAKE A LAND FULL OF GERMANS BUT APPARENTLY DREW
NO FIRE TILL THEY WERE WELL AWAY LUNGING AND TRAMPLING OVER THE
ENEMY MACHINEGUNPOSTS THAT HAD ANNOYED OUR FOLK FOR SO LONG THE
ONLY SERIOUS WORK FOR THE BATTALION WAS TO SECURE A SMALL TRENCH
COVER THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RAILWAY WITH THEIR FIRE AND ESTABLISH
A POST AT THE RAILWAY CROSSING AS SOON AS A TANK HAD PASSED OVER
THE TRENCH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED EARLY IN THE NIGHT AFTER A SMALL
BOMBINGBRAWL WITH THE ENEMY THE TANK DETAILED TO PASS BY THAT WAY
IN THE MORNING WAS WARNED OF THE OCCUPATION AND TOLD NOT TO FIRE INTO
IT AS IT CAME ALONG AND ALL WAS WELL THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT A COUPLE
OF COMPANIES ASSISTED BY EIGHT TANKS SHOULD CAPTURE HAMELINCOURT
A MILE EAST OF MOYENVILLE WHICH LATTER HAD BEEN TAKEN BEFORE THE
FOG LIFTED BY THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE BUT THIS WAS CANCELLED AFTER
MUCH WASTE OF TIME AND THE BATTALION LAY STILL UNDER A SHELLING OF
MUSTARDGAS AND PLEASANTLY WATCHED PRISONERS BEING SENT BACK

THE ENEMYS FRONT WAS GIVING BEFORE THE ATTACK OF EIGHT DIVISIONS
BUT NOT WITHOUT SUDDEN AND AWKWARD RESISTANCES DUE TO THE CUTUP
AND TRENCHED STATE OF THE GROUND THAT HID TOO MANY MACHINEGUNS FOR
COMFORT AND THE GASNUISANCE GREW STEADILY WORSE

THE BATTALION LAY WHERE THEY WERE THE NEXT DAY AUGUST 22 BUT SENT
OUT A PATROL UNDER 2ND LIEUTENANT FARADAY TO WORK UP A TRENCH NEAR
HAMEL SWITCH TO THE NORTH OF HAMELINCOURT AFTER CAPTURING FOUR
GERMANS IT CAME UNDER MACHINEGUN FIRE FROM HAMELINCOURT A PLATOON
WAS SENT TO SUPPORT IT BUT WAS WITHDRAWN AS THE HAMELINCOURT ATTACK
HAD BEEN POSTPONED TILL THE NEXT DAY THEN THE PATROL HAD TO RETIRE
ACROSS ABOMINABLE SHALLOW TRENCHES CLOGGED WITH WIRE AND LAVISHLY
MACHINEGUNNED THE GERMANS TRIED TO CUT THEM OFF THEY WITHDREW
FIGHTING THEIR LEWISGUN WAS KNOCKED OUT AND FIVE MEN WOUNDED WHILE
THESE WERE BEING HELPED BACK THE LIEUTENANT AND TWO MEN SERGEANT
DOLAN AND PRIVATE TAIT COVERED THE RETREAT AMONG THE WIRE NEXT
FARADAY WAS WOUNDED BADLY IN THE FOOT AND THE SERGEANT AND PRIVATE
CARRIED HIM IN TURN HE BEING SIX FEET LONG AND NOT NARROW WHILE THE
REST OF THE PARTY THREW BOMBS AT THE GERMANS AND TRIED TO CLOSE WITH
THEM EVENTUALLY THEY ALL REACHED HOME SAFE DOLANS ONE COMMENT ON
THE AFFAIR WAS TIS HEAVY GOING OUT YONDER LIEUTENANT FARADAY WAS
AWARDED THE MC AND DOLAN THE DCM LATER ON IN 1919 DOLAN ALSO
RECEIVED THE MDAILLE MILITAIRE FOR GALLANTRY ON MANY OCCASIONS

SEEN AGAINST THE GIGANTIC BACKGROUND OF THE OPENING CAMPAIGN IT WAS
A MICROSCOPICAL AFFAIRA STRUGGLE OF ANTS ROUND A SINGLE GRAINBUT
IT MOVED MEN STRONGLY WHILE THEY WATCHED

FOR THE REASON THAT ALWAYS LEADS A BATTALION TO BE HARDEST WORKED
ON THE EDGE OF BATTLE THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE LINE ON THE 23RD
CAUTIOUSLY UNDER GAS AND COMMON SHELL AND MARCHED BACK SEVEN MILES
IN FIVE HOURS TO BERLESAUBOIS BEHIND MONCHYAUBOIS IN ORDER TO
BE MARCHED BACK AGAIN NEXT DAY TO BOIRYST MARTIN WHERE THEY SPENT
THE DAY IN THE COJEUL VALLEY AND AFTERWARDS AUGUST 25 MOVED UP
INTO SUPPORT IN THE HAMEL SWITCH BETWEEN HAMELINCOURT AND ST LGER
HAMELINCOURT HAD BEEN TAKEN ON THE 23RD BY THE 2ND BRIGADE AND AS
THE NIGHT CAME DOWN WET THE MEN MADE WHAT SHELTERS THEY COULD FROM
CORRUGATED IRON AND WOOD LYING ABOUT THE TRENCHES HEREABOUTS HAD
EVERY DISADVANTAGE THAT COULD BE DESIRED SOME WERE PART OF THE ARMY
LINE AND HAD BEEN DUG A FOOT OR TWO DEEP WITH THE SPADE AS LINES TO
BE DEVELOPED IN CASE OF NEED PRESUMABLY IT WAS NOBODYS BUSINESS
TO COMPLETE THEM SO WHEN THE TROUBLE ARRIVED THESE GUTTERS BEING
OFFICIALLY TRENCHES WERE DULY FILLED BY THE TROOPS AND AS DULY
SHELLED BY THE ENEMY

FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE BATTALION MOVED FORWARD ON THE 26TH THEIR
TRENCHES WERE WAISTDEEP WHICH TO MEN WHO HAD SPENT MOST OF THE DAY
IN THE DRY BED OF THE COJEUL RIVER UNDER GAS AND COMMON SHELL WAS
NO GREAT TREAT

SINCE THE 21ST AUGUST THE GUARDS DIVISION HAD BEEN WELL EMPLOYED ITS
2ND BRIGADE WITH THE SECOND DIVISION ON ITS RIGHT HAD CAPTURED THE
ABLAINZEVELLEMOYENNEVILLE SPUR AND THE SECOND DIVISION HAD TAKEN
COURCELLES BY THE NIGHT OF THE 23RD WHEN THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE
RELIEVED THE 2ND AND THE SECOND DIVISION HAD CAPTURED ERVILLERS ON
THE ARRASBAPAUME ROAD THE GUARDS DIVISION WITH THEIR 1ST BRIGADE
IN SUPPORT WAS WITHIN HALF A MILE OF ST LGER AND IN TOUCH WITH
THE FIFTYSIXTH DIVISION ON THEIR LEFT WHICH WAS TRYING TO WORK
ROUND THE HEAD OF THE HINDENBURG LINE AND TURN IN FROM THE NORTH AT
THIS POINT RESISTANCE STIFFENED THE HILLY GROUND CUT AND CROSSCUT
WITH OLD TRENCHES AND THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW ONES LENT ITSELF TO
THE STOPPING GAME OF WELLPLACED MACHINEGUNS EQUALLY FROM ROUND
CROISILLES WHERE THE FIFTYSIXTH DIVISION WAS ENGAGED FROM ABOUT
ST LGER WOOD WHERE THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE SUPPORTED BY TANKS
WAS RENEWING ITS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE GERMAN ANTITANKRIFLE
AND FROM MORY WHERE THE SIXTYSECOND DIVISION WAS DELAYED BY THE
DIVISION ON ITS RIGHT BEING HELD UP AN ENEMY BALLOON OR TWO HUNG ON
THE HORIZON AND SOME INQUISITIVE LOWFLYING AEROPLANES HINTED AT
COMING TROUBLE THE LINE EXPECTED AS MUCH BUT THEY DID NOT SEEM SO
WELL INFORMED FARTHER BACK


THE AFFAIR OF ST LGER

ON THE 26TH AUGUST ORDERS ARRIVED THAT THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE WOULD
NOW TAKE UP THE RUNNING FROM THE 3RD AND ADVANCE EASTWARD FROM
ST LGER TOWARDS ECOUST TILL OPPOSITION WAS MET THERE WERE OF
COURSE REFINEMENTS ON THIS IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE GIST OF IT
THE 2ND GRENADIERS AND THE 2ND COLDSTREAM WOULD ATTACK WITH THE
BATTALION IN SUPPORT THE MEN WERE IN THEIR TRENCHES BY TEATIME ON
THE 26TH NO 1 COMPANY IN JEWEL TRENCH JUST EAST OF THE ENTRANCE TO
THE LITTLE SENSE RIVER VALLEY AND THE OTHERS DISPOSED ALONG THE
LINE OF MORY SWITCH AN OLD TRENCH NOW ONLY A FOOT DEEP BATTALION
HEADQUARTERS LAY IN AN ABANDONED GERMAN STORES DUGOUT FINAL ORDERS
DID NOT ARRIVE TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT ON THE 26TH AND THERE WAS MUCH
TO ARRANGE AND LINK UP BETWEEN THEN AND SEVEN OCLOCK BARRAGE TIME
THE GRENADIERS WERE ON THE RIGHT AND THE COLDSTREAM ON THE LEFT OF
THE BATTALION THE LATTER FOLLOWING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEHIND WITH
NOS 1 AND 3 COMPANIES TO FEED THE GRENADIERS AND NOS 4 AND 2 FOR
THE COLDSTREAM AS THE FRONT WAS SO WIDE THEY SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE
AND KEPT AS CLOSE AS MIGHT BE TO THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN THE TWO
LEADING BATTALIONS WHICH RAN BY MORY SWITCH AND HALLY AVENUE THE
HOT DAY BROKE WITH A GORGEOUS SUNRISE OVER A DESOLATE LANDSCAPE THAT
REEKED IN ALL ITS HOLLOWS OF GAS AND CORDITE A MOMENT OR TWO AFTER
OUR BARRAGE FIELDGUNS ONLY OPENED THE ENEMY PUT DOWN A HEAVY
REPLY AND INTO THE SMOKE AND DUST OF IT THE COMPANIES IN ARTILLERY
FORMATION WALKED UP THE ROAD WITHOUT HESITATION OR ONE MAN LOSING
HIS PLACE NO 1 COMPANY LEADING ON THE RIGHT DISAPPEARED AT ONCE
AFTER THEY HAD PASSED THEIR JUMPINGOFF POINT AT MORY SWITCH ALMOST
THE FIRST SHELLS CAUGHT THE LEADING PLATOON WHEN LIEUTENANT J
N WARD WAS KILLED AND LIEUTENANT P S MACMAHON WOUNDED AS SOON
AS THEY WERE CLEAR OF THE BARRAGE THEY CAME UNDER FULL BLAST OF
MACHINEGUN FIRE AND SAW THE GRENADIERS PRESENTLY LIE DOWN ENFILADED
ON BOTH FLANKS FOUR OF OUR MACHINEGUNS TRIED TO WORK FORWARD
AND CLEAR OUT THE HINDRANCES BUT THE FIRE WAS TOO STRONG BOTH
BATTALIONS WERE FINALLY HELD UP AND THE GRENADIERS WERE PRACTICALLY
CUT TO PIECES WITH THEIR RESERVE COMPANIES AS THESE STROVE TO
REINFORCE THE THINNED LINE AFTER WHAT SEEMED AN IMMENSE TIME TWO
HOURS OR SO CAPTAIN THOMPSON SEEING THAT AS FAR AS THAT SECTOR
WAS CONCERNED THE THING WAS HUNG UP ORDERED HIS MEN TO DIG IN IN
SUPPORT AND THEY SPENT TILL NIGHTFALL RECOVERING CASUALTIESTHEIR
OWN THOSE OF THE BATTALIONS AHEAD AND OF THE GUARDS MACHINEGUNS

NO 3 COMPANY WHICH FOLLOWED NO 1 SUFFERED JUST AS HEAVILY FROM
THE BARRAGE VERY SOON THEIR COMMANDER CAPTAIN JOYCE WAS WOUNDED
AND LIEUTENANT H R BALDWIN KILLED SECOND LIEUTENANT HEATON WHO
TOOK OVER WAS GASSED IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON AND CSM
OHARA THEN COMMANDED THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO EITHER SAVE
DIG IN LIKE NO 1 BEHIND THE GRENADIERS AND A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT
OF THEM

NO 4 COMPANY UNDER CAPTAIN HEGARTY FOLLOWING THE COLDSTREAM
GOT THE WORST BARRAGE OF ALL AS SOON AS THEY WERE CLEAR OF THEIR
TRENCHES AND FOUND THE COLDSTREAM HELD UP FRONT AND FLANK WITHIN
FIFTY YARDS OF THE SUNKEN ROAD WHENCE THEY HAD STARTED NO 15
PLATOON OF THE IRISH GUARDS WAS ALMOST WIPED OUT AND THE REMAINS OF
IT JOINED WITH NO 13 TO MAKE A DEFENSIVE FLANK WHILE NO 14 CRAWLED
OR WRIGGLED FORWARD TO REINFORCE THE COLDSTREAM AND NO 16 LAY IN
RESERVE IN A SUNK ROAD SUNK ROADS WERE THE ONLY SHELTER FOR SUCH AS
DID NOT WISH TO BECOME EARLY CASUALTIES

NO 2 COMPANY CAPTAIN A PAGET FOLLOWING NO 4 HAD BEEN HELD BACK
FOR A FEW MINUTES BY THE CO MAJOR R BAGGALLAY ON THE FRINGE
OF THE BARRAGE TO BE SLIPPED THROUGH WHEN IT SEEMED TO LIGHTEN
THEY ALSO LAUNCHED OUT INTO A WORLD THAT WAS ALL FLANK OR SUPPORT
OF BATTALIONS WHICH COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR FOUND WHO WERE
THEMSELVES OUTFLANKED BY MACHINEGUNS IN A LANDSCAPE THAT WAS ONE
STUMBLINGBLOCK OF SHALLOW TRENCHES WHICH SUDDENLY FADED OUT THEY
CROSSED THE ST LGERVRAUCOURT ROAD AND BORE EAST AFTER CLEARING
THE ST LGER WOOD TILL THEY REACHED THE ST LGER RESERVE TRENCH
AND HELD IT FROM THE LONGATTE ROAD TO WHERE IT JOINED THE BANKS
RESERVE SAYS ONE RECORD AT THIS TIME CAPTAIN PAGET WAS IN
IGNORANCE OF THE SUCCESS OR LOCATION OF THE ATTACKING BATTALIONS AND
BOTH OF HIS FLANKS EXPOSED AS FAR AS HE KNEW THE ENEMY MACHINEGUNS
WERE HAMMERING HOME THAT KNOWLEDGE AND ONE OF THE PLATOONS HAD LOST
TOUCH ALTOGETHER AND WAS OUT IN THE DEADLY OPEN SO IN THE TRENCH
THEY LAY TILL AN OFFICER OF THE COLDSTREAM CAME OVER AND TOLD PAGET
THE GENERAL SITUATION WHICH UNOFFICIALLY RAN THIS SHOW IS HELD
UP HE BORROWED A SECTION FROM NO 5 PLATOON TO HELP TO BUILD UP
A FLANK TO GUARD THE EAST SIDE OF ST LGER AND VANISHED AMONG THE
INCREASING SHELLHOLES

WELL ON IN THE MORNING A MESSAGE ARRIVED FROM CAPTAIN HEGARTY NO
4 COMPANY THAT HE AND HIS MEN WERE ON THE ST LGERVRAUCOURT ROAD
AND HELD UP LIKE THE REST CAPTAIN PAGET WENT OVER IN THE USUAL WAY
BY A SERIES OF BOLTS FROM SHELLHOLE TO SHELLHOLE TRYING TO CLEAR
UP AN ONLY TOOCLEAR SITUATION ON THE WAY HE FOUND A LOST PLATOON
SENT IT TO DIG IN ON THE LEFT OF NO 2 COMPANY AND ALSO SAW THE
CO 2ND COLDSTREAM AND EXPLAINED HIS OWN DISPOSITIONS THEY WERE
NOT MADE TOO SOON FOR IN A SHORT TIME THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON NO 2
COMPANY WHICH CAME WITHIN SIXTY YARDS BEFORE IT WAS BROKEN UP BY OUR
SMALLARM FIRE THE GERMANS WERE FOLLOWED UP AS THEY RETURNED ACROSS
THE ECOUSTMORY RIDGE BY LONGRANGE SHOOTING IN WHICH FOR THE SAKE
OF ECONOMY CAPTURED ENEMY RIFLES AND AMMUNITION WERE USED

BY THIS TIME THE WHOLE FRONT WAS SPLIT UP INTO SMALL OR LARGE
SCATTERED POSTS IN TRENCHES OR UNDER COVER EACH HELD DOWN BY
MACHINEGUNS WHICH PUNISHED EVERY MOVEMENT TWO COMPANIES 2 AND
4 WERE NEAR THE ST LGER TREES A CLUMP OF NINE TREES ON THE ST
LGERECOUST ROAD MIXED UP WITH THE COLDSTREAM POSTS THE OTHER
TWO WERE DUG IN BEHIND THE GRENADIERS ON THE RIGHT BATTALION
HEADQUARTERS CIRCULATED SPASMODICALLY AND BY RUSHES WHEN IT SAW ITS
CHANCE FROM ONE POINT TO THE OTHER OF THE MOST UNWHOLESOME GROUND
EVEN AT THE TIME SOME OF ITS SHELLHOLE CONFERENCES STRUCK THE
MEMBERS AS COMIC BUT HISTORY DOES NOT RECORD THE THINGS THAT WERE
SAID BY DRIPPING OFFICERS BETWEEN MOUTHFULS OF DIRT AND GAS

EVERY BATTLE HAS ITS SPECIAL CHARACTERISTIC ST LGER WAS ONE OF
HEAT SUNSHINE SWEAT THE FLAVOUR OF AT LEAST TWO GASES TASTED
THROUGH RESPIRATORS OR IN THE RAW THE WAIL OF MACHINEGUN BULLETS
SWEEPING THE CRESTS OF SUNKEN ROADS THE SUDDEN VISION OF WOUNDED
IN STILLSMOKING SHELLHOLES OR LAID IN THE SIDES OF A SCARP SHARP
WHIFFS OF NEWSPILT BLOOD AND HERE AND THERE A FACE UPON WHICH THE
SUN STARED WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGE SO THE HOURS WORE ON UNDER A
SENSE OF SPACE HEAT AND LIGHT DEATH ALWAYS JUST OVER THE EDGE OF
THAT SPACE AND IMPUDENTLY BUSY IN THAT LIGHT

ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TEATIME IN THE REAL WORLD CAPTAIN
PAGET A MAN OF UNHURRIED AND CAREFUL SPEECH AND IMPERTURBABLE SOUL
REPORTED TO THE CO WHOM HE FOUND BY THE ST LGER TREES THAT
THERE WERE HUNS ON HIS RIGHTSAME TRENCH AS HIMSELF IT WAS AN
AWKWARD SITUATION THAT NEEDED MENDING BEFORE DUSK AND IT WAS MADE
WORSE BY THE POSTS OF THE COLDSTREAM AND SOME GUARDS MACHINEGUNS
POSTS AS WELL AS THOSE OF OUR NO 4 COMPANY BEING MIXED UP WITHIN
CLOSE RANGE OF NO 2 THE CO DECIDED THAT IF A BARRAGE COULD BE
BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE TRENCH AND ITS RATHER CROWDED NEIGHBOURHOOD
NO 2 MIGHT ATTACK IT A YOUNG GUNNER FOWLER BY NAME CAST UP AT
THAT JUNCTURE AND SAID IT MIGHT BE MANAGED IF THE BATTALION WITHDREW
THEIR POSTS ROUND THE AREA HE HAD A TELEPHONE STILL UNCUT TO
HIS GUNS AND WOULD OBSERVE THEIR REGISTRATION HIMSELF THE POSTS
INCLUDING THOSE OF THE GUARDS MACHINEGUNS WERE WITHDRAWN AND
FOWLER WAS AS NEAR AS MIGHT BE KILLED BY ONE OF HIS OWN REGISTERING
SHOTS HE GOT HIS 18POUNDERS TO HIS LIKING AT LAST AND TEN MINUTES
BRISK BARRAGE DESCENDED ON THE TRENCH WHEN IT STOPPED AND BEFORE
OUR MEN COULD MOVE UP WENT A WHITE FLAG AMID YELLS OF KAMERAD AND
THE HUNS CAME OUT HANDS ALOFT TO BE MET BY OUR MEN WHO FORGETTING
THAT EXPOSED TROOPS FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE WOULD CERTAINLY BE GUNNED
BY THE NEAREST ENEMYPOST HAD TO BE SHOOED AND SHOUTED BACK TO COVER
BY THEIR OFFICERS THE PRISONERS NINETY OF THEM WERE HERDED INTO
A WOOD WHERE THEY CAST THEIR HELMETS ON THE GROUND LAUGHED AND
SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER TO THE IMMENSE AMUSEMENT OF OUR PEOPLE
THE CAPTURE HAD TURNED A VERY BLANK DAY INTO SOMETHING OF A SUCCESS
AND THE IRISH WERE GRATEFUL TO THE BAG THIS AT LEAST EXPLAINS
THE POLITENESS OF THE ORDERLY WHO CHAPERONED RATHER THAN CONDUCTED
THE HUN OFFICER TO THE REAR WITH MANY A THIS WAY SIR MIND OUT
NOW SIR YOU DONT SLIP DOWN THE BANK THEY PUT A PLATOON INTO THE
CAPTURED TRENCH AND LAY DOWN TO A NIGHT OF BURSTS OF HEAVY SHELLING
BUT THE ENEMY WHETHER BECAUSE OF DIRECT PRESSURE OR BECAUSE THEY HAD
DONE THEIR DELAYING WORK ASKED FOR NO MORE AND DREW BACK IN THE DARK

WHEN MORNING OF THE 28TH BROKE FEW SIGNS OF ENEMY MOVEMENT WERE
OBSERVED MEN SAY THAT THERE IS NO MISTAKING THE FEEL OF THE
FRONT UNDER THIS JOYOUS ASPECT THE SENSE OF CONSTRICTION DEPARTS
AS SWIFTLY AS A HEADACHE AND WITH IT OFTEN THE TASTE THAT WAS IN
THE MOUTH ONE BY ONE AS THE LOVELY DAY WENT ON THE PATROLS FROM
THE COMPANIES MADE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS TILL AT LAST
THE WHOLE LINE REFORMED AND IN TOUCH ON EITHER FLANK FELT FORWARD
UNDER LIGHT SHELLING FROM WITHDRAWING GUNS AN AEROPLANE DROPPED SOME
BOMBS ON THE BATTALION AS IT DREW NEAR TO THE ST LGER TREES WHICH
WOUNDED TWO MEN AND TWO GUNNER OFFICERS ONE OF WHOMNOT FOWLER
THE BOY WHO ARRANGED FOR THE BARRAGEDIED IN FATHER BROWNES ARMS
ON THE ROAD AT THAT POINT WHERE THE WOUNDED AND DYING OF THE FIGHT
HAD BEEN LAID ONLY DRIED POOLS OF BLOOD AND SOME STAINED COTTONWADS
REMAINED DARKENING IN THE SUN SUCH OFFICERS AS THE GAS HAD AFFECTED
IN THAT WAY WENT ABOUT THEIR ROUTINEWORK VOMITING DISGUSTEDLY AT
INTERVALS

BATTALION HEADQUARTERS WHICH HAD NOMINALLY SPENT THE PREVIOUS DAY IN
A WAISTDEEP TRENCH SET UP OFFICE AT THE ST LGER TREES AND THE
ADVANCE OF THE GUARDS DIVISION CONTINUED FOR A MILE OR SO THEN ON A
CONSOLIDATED LINE WITH MACHINEGUNS CHATTERING TO THE EASTWARD IT
WAITED TO BE RELIEVED AS PRELUDE TO THEIR WATCH ON THE RHINE THE
AFFAIR WAS NOT AUSPICIOUS THE GRENADIERS ON WHOM THE BRUNT OF THE
FIGHT FELL WERE BADLY KNOCKED OUT AND OF THEIR SIXTEEN OFFICERS BUT
FOUR WERE ON THEIR FEET THE COLDSTREAM WERE SO WEAKENED THAT THEY
BORROWED OUR NO 4 COMPANY TO CARRY ON WITH AND THE IRISH THOUGHT
THEMSELVES LUCKY TO HAVE LOST NO MORE THAN TWO OFFICERS LIEUTENANT
J N WARD AND LIEUTENANT H R BALDWIN DEAD AND SIX WOUNDED OR
GASSED IN ADDITION TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OTHER RANKS KILLED OR
WOUNDED THE WOUNDED OFFICERS WERE CAPTAIN W JOYCE LIEUTENANTS P
S MACMAHON AND C A J VERNON WHO WAS INCAPACITATED FOR A WHILE
BY TEARGAS IN THE MIDDLE OF ACTION AND LED AWAY BLINDED AND VERY
WROTH ALSO 2ND LIEUTENANTS H A CONNOLLY G T HEATON AND A E
HUTCHINSON

THE DIVISION WAS RELIEVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE 28TH THE BATTALION
ITSELF AS FAR AS REGARDED NO 1 COMPANY BY THE 1ST GORDONS FROM
THE THIRD DIVISION NOS 2 AND 4 COMPANIES BY ANOTHER BATTALION AND
NO 3 COMPANY UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE 2ND GRENADIERS THEY MARCHED
BACK TO THEIR POSITIONS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE VERY GLAD
THAT IT WAS ALL BEHIND US AND THEIR SHELTERS OF BITS OF WOOD AND
ROUGH IRON SEEMED LIKE REST IN A FAIR LAND

ON THE 29TH AUGUST A HOT DAY THEY LAY IN OLD TRENCHES OVER THE
MOYENNEVILLE SPUR IN FRONT OF ADINFER WOOD FACING DOUCHY AND AYETTE
WHERE THREE WEEKS AGO NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED THEY TALKED TOGETHER
OF THE FAROFF TIMES WHEN THEY HELD THAT LINE DAILY EXPECTING THE
ENEMY ADVANCE AND THE OFFICERS LAY OUT LUXURIOUSLY IN THE WOOD IN
THE EVENING AFTER MESS WHILE THE MEN MADE THEMSELVES LITTLE HOMES
IN IT

NEXT DAY THEY RESTED FOR THE MEN WERE VERY TIRED AND ON THE LAST
OF THE MONTH THE WHOLE BATTALION WAS WASHED IN THE DIVISIONAL BATHS
THAT HAD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES AT ADINFER BUT THE ENEMY HAD NOT
FORGOTTEN THEM AND ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER THEIR SHELTERS AND
TENTS IN THE DELIGHTFUL WOOD WERE BOMBED SIX MEN WERE INJURED FIVE
BEING BURIED IN A TRENCH AND OF THESE TWO WERE SUFFOCATED BEFORE
THEY COULD BE DUG OUT


TOWARDS THE CANAL DU NORD

AND THAT WAS ALL THE REST ALLOWED TO THE BATTALION ON THE 2ND
SEPTEMBER THE CANADIAN CORPS OF THE FIRST ARMY BROKE THAT OUTLYING
SPUR OF THE HINDENBURG SYSTEM KNOWN AS THE DROCOURTQUANT SWITCH
WITH ITS WIRES TRENCHES AND POSTS AND THE FIFTYSEVENTH AND
FIFTYSECOND DIVISIONS AFTER HARD WORK EQUALLY SMASHED THE
TRIANGLE OF FORTIFICATIONS NORTHWEST OF QUANT WHERE THE SWITCH
JOINED THE SYSTEM THE GAIN SHOOK THE WHOLE OF THE HINDENBURG LINE
SOUTH OF QUANT AND AFTER FIVE DAYS CLEANUP BEHIND THE LINE THE
GUARDS DIVISION WERE ORDERED TO GO IN AGAIN AT THE VERY BREAST OF
HINDENBURGS WORKS NO ONE KNEW WHAT THE ENEMYS IDEA MIGHT BE BUT
THERE WAS STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT IF HE DID NOT HOLD HIS DEFENCE AT
THAT POINT HE MIGHT CRACK BUT YELL UNDERSTAND FOR ALL THAT WE
DID NOT BELIEVE JERRY WOULD CRACK PAST MENDIN

THE BATTALION SPENT THE NIGHT OF THE 2ND SEPTEMBER THEN IN SHELTERS
IN HAMEL SWITCH TRENCH ON THEIR WAY BACK FROM ADINFER WOOD TO THE
BATTLE THE FRONT HAD NOW SHIFTED TO VERY MUCH THE ONE AS WE HELD
IN APRIL 1917 ERE THE DAYS OF CAMBRAI AND BOURLON WOOD THE 1ST
GUARDS BRIGADE WERE IN DIVISIONAL RESERVE AT LAGNICOURT THREE MILES
SOUTHWEST OF ECOUSTSTMEIN WHERE THE BATTALION HAD TO CROSS THEIR
STILL FRESH BATTLEFIELD OF LESS THAN A WEEK BACK AS AN APPETIZER TO
THEIR HOT DINNERS THEY OCCUPIED A WAISTDEEP OLD TRENCH A LITTLE
WEST OF LAGNICOURT AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NO SHELLING THOUGH
THE ROADS WERE FULL OF OUR TRAFFIC A GOOD DEAL OF IT IN FULL VIEW
OF BOURLON WOOD GOING OVER USED GROUND FOR THE THIRD TIME AND
NOTING ONES MANY DEAD COMRADES DOES NOT MAKE FOR HIGH SPIRIT EVEN
THOUGH ONES OWN DIVISIONAL GENERAL HAS WRITTEN ONES OWN BRIGADIER
ALL BATTALIONS OF THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE DISCHARGED THEIR DUTY
SPLENDIDLY AT ST LGER

LAGNICOURT WAS SHELLED A LITTLE BY A HIGHVELOCITY GUN BETWEEN THE
4TH AND THE 6TH OF SEPTEMBER AND SEVENTEEN BOMBS WERE DROPPED ON THE
BATTALION WOUNDING TWO MEN

BY ALL REASON THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BITTER FIGHT ON THAT GROUND
AND FULL PREPARATION FOR IT WAS MADE BUT THE ENEMY AFTER ST LGER
SAW FIT TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY OUT OF ALL THAT
AREA FOR ONE BEWILDERING DAWN AND DAY THE BOTTOM FELL OUT OF THE
FRONT AS FAR AS THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS CONCERNED IT IS A CURIOUS
STORY EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT DIRECTLY CONCERN THE BATTALION HERE
IS ONE DETAIL OF IT

ON THE 3RD SEPTEMBER THE 2ND BRIGADE TOILED IN FROM MONCHY IN FULL
WARKIT AND TIRED WITH THE LONG DAYS HEAT FORMED UP WEST OF
LAGNICOURT BEFORE DAWN DETAILED TO WIN IF THEY COULD A THOUSAND
YARDS OR SO OF CHEWEDUP GROUND THEY WENT OVER THE TOP UNDER
A CREEPING BARRAGE ONE GUN OF WHICH PERSISTENTLY FIRED SHORT
ANDFOUND NOTHING WHATEVER IN FRONT OF THEM SAVE A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER
OF DEAD HORSES SOME FEW CORPSES AND AN INTOLERABLE BUZZING OF
FLIES AS THEY TOPPED THE RIDGE ABOVE LAGNICOURT THEY SAW AGAINST
THE FIRST LIGHT OF THE SUN DUMP AFTER GERMAN DUMP BLAZING PALELY
TOWARDS THE EAST THAT WAS ALL THEY WANDERED WONDERING INTO A
VAST GRASSY HABITATIONLESS PLAIN THAT STRETCHED AWAY TOWARDS
THE BAPAUMECAMBRAI ROAD NOT A MACHINEGUN BROKE THE STUPEFYING
STILLNESS FROM ANY FOLD OF IT YET IT WAS THE VERY PLACE FOR SUCH
SURPRISES AEROPLANES SWOOPED LOW LOOKED THEM WELL OVER AND SKIMMED
OFF NO DISTANT GUNS OPENED THE ADVANCE BECAME A ROUTEMARCH A
SUNDAY WALKOUT EDGED WITH TENSE SUSPICION THEY SAW A GERMAN
COOKER WRECKED ON THE GRASS AND BESIDE IT THE BODIES OF TWO
CLEAN GOODLOOKING BOYS PATHETICALLY LAID OUT AS FOR BURIAL THE
THING WAS A BOOBYTRAP ARRANGED TO MOVE OUR PEOPLES PITY SOME
PITIED AND WERE BLOWN TO BITS BY THE CONCEALED MINE NO ONE MADE ANY
COMMENT THEY WERE TIRED WITH CARRYING THEIR KIT IN THE SUN AMONG
THE MADDENING FLIES THE THOUSAND YARDS STRETCHED INTO MILES TWICE
OR THRICE THEY HALTED AND BEGAN TO DIG IN FOR FEAR OF ATTACK BUT
NOTHING OVERTOOK THEM AND THEY INSTALLED THEMSELVES ABOUT DUSK IN
SOME OLD BRITISH TRENCHES OUTSIDE BOURSIES FOUR MILES AND MORE AS
THE CROW FLIES FROM LAGNICOURT AT MIDNIGHT UP CAME THEIR RATIONS
AND THE PUNCTUAL HOMELETTERS ACROSS THAT ENCHANTED DESERT WHICH HAD
SPARED THEM THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR BRIGADE ARTILLERY WAS IN PLACE
BEHIND THE NEXT RISE READY TO DELIVER BARRAGES ON DEMAND AND IN DUE
COURSE THE WHOLE OF OUR LINE ON THAT SECTOR FLOWED FORWARD

THE BATTALION RELIEVED THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS IN THE FRONT LINE NEAR
MUVRES ON THE 7THA QUIET RELIEF FOLLOWED BY SEVERE GASSING HERE
THEY PASSED TWO DAYS IN THE DELICATE AND DIFFICULT BUSINESS OF
FEELING ALL ABOUT THEM AMONG THE MASS OF OLD TRENCHES TO LOCATE
ENEMYS POSTS AND TO WATCH WHAT POINTS OF VANTAGE MIGHT OFFER THE
WRECKAGE OF THE HOUSES ROUND MUVRES INTO WHICH THE TRENCHES RAN
LENT ITSELF EXCELLENTLY TO ENEMY ACTIVITY AND MEN PLAYED BLINDMANS
BUFF ROUND BITS OF BROKEN WALLS WHEREVER THEY EXPLORED THEIR LEFT
WAS IN THE AIR THEIR RIGHT UNDER THE CARE OF PROVIDENCE AND THEIR
SUPPORTS WERE FAR OFF NO 3 COMPANY CAPTAIN G L BAMBRIDGE
MC WHILE TRYING TO CLOSE A GAP BETWEEN THE TWO FRONT COMPANIES 3
AND 1 BY PEACEFUL PENETRATION WITH A BOMBINGPARTY FOUND ENEMY IN
THE TRENCH DROVE HIM UP IT AS FAR AS THEY COULD BUILT A BARRICADE
AND WERE THEN HEAVILY COUNTERRAIDED BY A COUPLE OF OFFICERS AND
TWENTY MEN WHOM THEY EJECTED AFTER AS THE COMPANY JUSTLY OWNED A
GOOD ATTEMPT THE ENEMY ATTEMPTED AGAIN ABOUT MIDNIGHT ON THE 8TH
WHEN HE WAS BOMBED OFF AND AGAIN ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 9TH IN AN
OUTLYING TRENCH MIXED UP WITH SMASHED CELLARS AND BROKEN FLOORS
WHERE HE CAPTURED TWO UNARMED STRETCHERBEARERS AND THREE MEN WHO
HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LINE BEFORE THOUGH IT DOES NEW HANDS NO HARM
TO REALIZE THAT FRONTLINE TRENCHES ARE NOT WARLEY BARRACKS AND
STRETCHERBEARERS LIKE ORDERLIES ARE PREY TO ALL THE WORLD STILL
THE MATTER COULD NOT BE PASSED OVER OUR TRENCHMORTARS ATTENDED
VIGOROUSLY TO THE ENEMY POSTS WHENCE THE RAID HAD BEEN LAUNCHED AND
IN THE AFTERNOON SENT A STRONG PATROL TO MAKE THE OUTRAGED TRENCH
SECURE LATER ON A PLATOON OF NO 1 COMPANY GOT INTO TOUCH WITH
THE BATTALION 8TH KINGS ON THEIR LEFT AND TOOK PART IN A SMALL
BICKER AS IT WAS DESCRIBED BUT WITH NO CASUALTIES

THEY WERE RELIEVED THE SAME NIGHT THOUGH THEY DID NOT EXPECT IT BY
THE 15TH BATTALION LOYAL NORTH LANCS WHO HAD NOT MADE SURE OF THEIR
ROUTE BEFOREHAND AND SO IN WET DARKNESS LOST THEIR WAY FAILED
TO MEET THE GUIDES AT THE RENDEZVOUS AND WERE HEAVILY SHELLED
THE RELIEF DRAGGED ON TILL WELL TOWARDS DAWN WHEN THE BATTALIONS
STRAGGLED OFF INTO SOME DRENCHING TRENCHES WITHOUT ANY SORT OF
ACCOMMODATION THE WHOLE THING THE MOST APPALLING MESS AND AGONY
I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THE WORST WAS WHEN A STRAY LIGHT WENT UP
AND SHOWED THE RELIEVED BATTALION UNDER POURING RAIN PLAYING FOLLOW
MY LEADER IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE LIKE CATERPILLARS IN THE HOPEFUL
BELIEF THAT THEY WERE MOVING TO THEIR DESTINATION THEY NEXT TOOK THE
PLACE OF THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE IN RESERVETRENCHES NEAR EDINBURGH
SUPPORT WHERE THEY STAYED TILL THE 14TH SEPTEMBER AND WERE NOT EVEN
ONCE SHELLED SALVAGE AND CLEANING UP WAS THEIR FATIGUEA DREADFUL
JOB AT ANY TIME FOR THE GROUND WAS FILLED WITH ANCIENT OFFAL AS
WELL AS NEWLOST FRENCH OF 14 MINGLED GROTESQUELY WITH THE RAW
PRODUCE OF YESTERDAYS BOMBINGRAID YET MENS FEELINGS BLUNT SO BY
USE THAT THEY WILL SCAVENGE YARD BY YARD OVER THE VERY CLAY OF THE
PIT INTO WHICH THEY THEMSELVES MAY AT ANY INSTANT BE STAMPED NOR
TURN A HAIR AT SHAPES MADE LAST YEAR IN THEIR LIKENESS THE BATTALION
WAS COMPLIMENTED BY ITS MAJORGENERAL ON THE EXTENT AND NEATNESS OF
ITS DUMP NO MERE CAMPAIGNING INTERFERES WITH THE ARMYS PASSION
FOR ELABORATE ECONOMIES A LITTLE BEFORE THIS THE ENTIRE BRITISH
EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WAS EXHORTED TO COLLECT AND TURN IN ALL SOLDER
FROM BULLYBEEF TINS AND THE LIKE NATURALLY THE THING BECAME A GAME
WITH BETTING ON RESULTS BETWEEN CORPS BUT WHEN A DARK ELDERLY
BROODING PRIVATE OF THE IRISH SPENT THREE HOURS STALKING A COLDSTREAM
COOKER WITH INTENT TO CONVEY AND MELT IT DOWN EVERY ONE FELT IT HAD
GONE FAR ENOUGH

ON THE 15TH SEPTEMBER THEY RELIEVED THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS IN THE OLD
TRENCHES WEST OF LAGNICOURT THERE THEY MANAGED TO PUT IN A LITTLE
BOXRESPIRATOR DRILL WHICH AT THE BEST IS A DRY FATIGUE BUT BE IT
NOTED WITH GRATITUDE BEER WAS OBTAINED FOR THE MEN AND SENT UP FROM
TRANSPORTLINES THE WHOLE AREA REEKED OF THE VARIOUS GASES WHICH
THE ENEMY WERE DISTRIBUTING WITH HEAVIES THEY HUNG IN THE HOLLOWS
AND WERE SUCKED UP BY THE DAYS HEAT AND NO TIME OR PLACE WAS SAFE
FROM THEM GASDISCIPLINE HAD TO BE INSISTED ON STRONGLY FOR EVEN
VETERANS GROW CARELESS OF A FOE THEY CANNOT SEE AND THE NEW HANDS
ARE LIKE CROUPY BABIES

ON THE 17TH SEPTEMBER THEY RELIEVED THE 2ND SCOTS GUARDS IN SUPPORT
AND NO 2 COMPANY TOOK OVER FROM A COMPANY OF THE WELSH GUARDS THEIR
TRENCHES WERE IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE BRITISH FRONT LINE OF THE OLD
TIMEFISH AVENUE SPRAT POST SHARK SUPPORT RAT AND RABBIT AVENUE
AND SO FORTH

THERE WAS DESULTORY SHELLING ON THE MORNING OF THE 18TH AND
HEAVIER WORK IN THE AFTERNOON CAUSING SIX CASUALTIES AND SLIGHTLY
WOUNDING CAPTAIN VERNON INTELLIGENCE OFFICER THEN THE SILENCE
OF PREPARATION FOR BATTLE FALLS ON THE RECORD IT WAS NOTHING TO
THE BATTALION THAT ON THE 18TH SEPTEMBER THE ENEMY APPARENTLY
ATTACKED SOUTH OF THE DIVISIONAL FRONT ALONG THE BAPAUMECAMBRAI
ROAD THE DEAD MUST BURY THEIR DEAD ON THE SOMME THEY HAD THEIR
OWN DISPOSITIONS TO ARRANGE AND REARRANGE AS MEN FOR ONE CAUSE OR
OTHER FELL OUT AND NO UNIT COULD AFFORD TO TAKE CHANCES WITH THE
HINDENBURG LINE AHEAD OF THEM AN WE KNOWIN WE WAS TOLD OFF TO
CROSS THAT DIRTY DITCH IN FRONT OF EM ALL THEIR WORLD AS WITH
EVERY OTHER DIVISION WAS LIMITED TO THE RESERVES BEHIND THEM WHO
SHOULD COME UP TO MAKE GOOD THEIR CASUALTIES THEIR TRENCHMORTAR
BATTERIES ALONGSIDE THEM AND THEIR OWN SELVES ABOUT TO BE USED IN
WHAT PROMISED TO BE ONE OF THE BLOODIEST SHOWS OF THE WAR

THOSE WHO WERE FOR THE FRONT LINE ENJOYED A WEEK TO WORK AND THINK
THINGS OVER THOSE WHO WERE SET ASIDE FOR THE SECOND COURSE WERE
BOMBED BY NIGHT ANDWENT MUSHROOMPICKING IN BACKAREAS BETWEEN
PARADES OR PLAYED RIOTOUS CRICKETMATCHES WITH PETROLTINS FOR
WICKETS

THEIR DIVISIONAL COMMANDER MAJORGENERAL FEILDING HAD LEFT ON
SEPTEMBER 11 TO SUCCEED SIR FRANCIS LLOYD IN COMMAND OF THE LONDON
DISTRICT AND GENERAL T G MATHESON CB HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO
THE COMMAND OF THE GUARDS DIVISION THE BATTALION WAS FULL STRENGTH
OFFICERS AND MEN FOR THERE HAD BEEN LITTLE DURING THE PAST MONTH TO
PULL IT DOWN


THE CROSSING OF THE CANAL DU NORD

OPERATIONS AGAINST THE HINDENBURG LINE WERE TO OPEN ON THE 27TH
SEPTEMBER WITH THE ATTACK OF FOURTEEN DIVISIONS OF THE FIRST AND
THIRD ARMIES ON A TWELVEMILE FRONT FROM OPPOSITE GOUZEAUCOURT IN
THE SOUTH TO OPPOSITE SAUCHYLESTRE SISTER TO SAUCHYCAUCHYUNDER
THE MARSHES OF THE SENSE RIVER IN THE NORTH IT WOULD BE HERALDED
BY TWO DAYS SOLID BOMBARDMENT ALONG THE ENTIRE FRONTS OF THE FIRST
THIRD AND FOURTH ARMIES SO THAT THE ENEMY MIGHT BE LEFT GUESSING
WHICH WAS TO HIT FIRST WHEN THE FIRST AND THIRD ARMIES WERE WELL
HOME THE FOURTH WOULD ATTEND TO THE GERMAN POSITION IN THE SOUTH
AND HEAVE THE WHOLE THING BACKWARD

THE SHARE OF THE GUARDS DIVISION IN THE NORTHERN ATTACK WAS TO CROSS
THE CANAL DU NORD AT LOCK SEVEN NORTH OF HAVRINCOURT ON A FRONT OF
A MILE THEN WORK THROUGH THE COMPLICATED TANGLE OF THE HINDENBURG
SUPPORT LINE DIRECTLY EAST ALONG THE RIDGE FROM FLESQUIRES VILLAGE
TO PREMY CHAPEL WHICH STANDS AT THE JUNCTION OF THE ROADS FROM
NOYELLES MARCOING AND GRAINCOURT AND TO CONSOLIDATE ON THE LINE
OF THE MARCOINGGRAINCOURT ROAD MEANTIME THE THIRD DIVISION ON
THEIR RIGHT WOULD TAKE THE VILLAGE OF FLESQUIRES THE FIFTYSECOND
DIVISION WOULD TAKE THE HINDENBURG LINE THAT LAY WEST OF THE CANAL
IN THE BEND OF IT AND WOULD THEN LET THE SIXTYTHIRD THROUGH WHO
WOULD SWING DOWN FROM THE NORTH AND ATTEND TO GRAINCOURT AND ANNEUX
VILLAGES THE TOTAL ADVANCE SET FOR THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS THREE
MILES BUT IF THE OPERATIONS WERE FULLY SUCCESSFUL THEY WERE TO
PUSH ON TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOYELLES THE THIRD DIVISION TO MARCOING
WHILE THE FIFTYSEVENTH COMING THROUGH THE SIXTYTHIRD WOULD TAKE
CANTAING AND FONTAINENOTREDAME IN THE GUARDS DIVISION ITSELF THE
2ND BRIGADE WAS TO MOVE OFF FIRST AND FERRET ITS WAY THROUGH A KNOT
OF HEAVILY WIRED TRENCHES THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE CANAL TAKE
THE HINDENBURG SUPPORT TRENCHES AND THEN FORM A DEFENSIVE FLANK TO
THE LEFT OF THE NEXT ADVANCE TILL THE FIFTYSECOND AND SIXTYTHIRD
DIVISIONS SHOULD HAVE SECURED GRAINCOURT THE 1ST BRIGADE WOULD PASS
THROUGH THEM AND CAPTURE THE TRENCHES ACROSS THE CANAL TO THE NORTH
AND NORTHEAST OF FLESQUIRES IF RESISTANCE WERE NOT TOO STRONG
THAT BRIGADE WAS TO GO ON TO THE SPUR RUNNING FROM FLESQUIRES TO
CANTAING AND HELP THE SIXTYTHIRD TURN THE GRAINCOURT LINE THE 3RD
BRIGADE PASSING THROUGH THE 1ST WOULD CARRY ON AND TAKE THE HIGH
GROUND ROUND PREMY CHAPEL

ENOUGH RAIN FELL THE DAY BEFORE TO GREASE THE GROUND UNCOMFORTABLY
AND WHEN AT 330 A M THE IRISH GUARDS MOVED OFF FROM THEIR RESERVE
TRENCHES WEST OF LAGNICOURT TO THEIR ASSEMBLY POSITIONS ALONG THE
DEMICOURTGRAINCOURT ROAD TO BULLEN TRENCH THE JUMPINGOFF PLACE
IT WAS POURING WET THEY WERE NOT SHELLED ON THE WAY UP BUT THE
USUAL NIGHTWORK WAS AFOOT IN THE BACKAREAS AND THOUGH OUR GUNS
AS OFTEN THE CASE ON THE EVE OF AN OUTBREAK HELD THEIR BREATH
THE ENEMYS ARTILLERY THREATENED IN THE DISTANCE AND THE LIGHTS
AND FLAMING ONIONS MARKED THEIR EXPECTANT FRONT JUST BEFORE THE
BATTALION REACHED THE RUINS OF DEMICOURT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION
BEHIND THEM AND THEY SAW OUTLINED AGAINST THE FLARE OF A BLAZING
DUMP LAGNICOURT WAY A FAT AND FOOLISH OBSERVATIONBALLOON ROCKING
AND DUCKING AT THE END OF ITS TETHER WITH THE AIR OF A NAUGHTY
BABY CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF DOING SOMETHING IT SHOULDNT SINCE THE
THING WAS VISIBLE OVER HALF A DEPARTMENT THEY CALLED IT NAMES BUT
IT MADE EXCUSE FOR A LITTLE TALK THAT BROKE THE TENSION TEA AND
RUM WERE SERVED OUT AT THE FIRST HALTA RITUAL WITH ITS USUAL GRIM
JESTSAND WHEN THEY REACHED THE ROAD IN FRONT OF DEMICOURT THEY
PERCEIVED THE BALLOON HAD DONE ITS DIRTY WORK TOO WELL THE ENEMY
LIKE OURSELVES CHANGES HIS FIELDLIGHTS ON OCCASION BUT ON ALL
OCCASIONS TWO RED LIGHTS ABOVE AND ONE BELOW MEAN TROUBLE UP GO
THE BLOODY PAWNBROKERS SAID A MAN WHO KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT AND AS
SOON AS THE OMINOUS GLARES ROSE THE GERMAN TRENCHMORTARS OPENED
ON THE BATTALION ENTERING THE COMMUNICATIONWAY THAT LED TO BULLEN
TRENCH OUR BARRAGE CAME DOWN AT ZERO 520 MORE TERRIFICALLY MEN
SAID THAN EVER THEY HAD EXPERIENCED AND WAS ANSWERED BY REDOUBLED
DEFENSIVE BARRAGES AFTER THAT SPEECH WAS CUT OFF SOME FIFTY YARDS
AHEAD OF BULLEN TRENCHWHICH BY THE WAY WAS ONLY THREE FEET
DEEPLAY THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS THE FIRST WAVE OF THE ATTACK ON
IN FRONT OF AND IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND THE IRISH FELL THE
RAIN OF THE TRENCHMORTARS FROM THE REAR THE GUARDS MACHINEGUNS
TORTURED ALL THERE WAS OF UNOCCUPIED AIR WITH THEIR INFERNAL
CLAMOURS THE SCOTS GUARDS WENT OVER AMONG THE SHELLSPOUTS AND
JERKING WIRES AT THE FIRST GLIMMER OF DAWN THE IRISH FOLLOWING IN A
RUSH THE LEADING COMPANIES WERE NO 3 LIEUTENANT H A A COLLETT
ON THE LEFT AND NO 4 2ND LIEUTENANT C S OBRIEN ON THE RIGHT

FIRST WAVE INSTEAD OF AS USUAL IN SUPPORT NO 2 COMPANY CAPTAIN

B A A OGILVY NO 4 THEY STAYED FOR A MOMENT IN THE TRENCH A
DEEP WIDE ONE OF THE HINDENBURG PATTERN WHICH THE SCOTS GUARDS HAD
LEFT IT WAS NO HEALTHY SPOT FOR THE SHELLS WERE LOCALISED HERE AND
THE DIRT FLUNG UP ALL ALONG IT IN WAVES MEN SCRAMBLED OUT OVER THE
SLIDING FLYING EDGES OF IT SAW A BANK HEAVE UP IN THE HALFLIGHT
AND KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE BEHIND THAT WAS THE CANAL BY THIS TIME ONE
OF THE TWO STOKES GUNS OF THE MORTAR BATTERY AND HALF THE GUNNERS
HAD BEEN WIPED OUT AND THE CASUALTIES IN THE LINE WERE HEAVY BUT
THEY HAD NO TIME TO COUNT THEN EARTH OPENED BENEATH THEIR FEET
AND SHOWED A WIDE DEEP DRY NEWLY MADE CANAL WITH A SMASHED IRON
BRIDGE LYING ACROSS THE BED OF IT AND AN UNFINISHED LOCK TO THE
RIGHT LOOKING LIKE SOME IMMENSE ENGINE OF WAR READY TO DO HURT IN
INCONCEIVABLE FASHIONS DIRECTLY BELOW THEM ON THE PALE HORRIBLY
HARD CONCRETE TROUGH WAS A COLLECTION OF AGITATED PINHEADS THE
STEEL HATS OF THE SCOTS GUARDS REARING LADDERS AGAINST THE FAR SIDE
OF THE GULF MIXED WITH THEM WERE THE DEAD INSOLENTLY UNINTERESTED
WHILE THE WOUNDED BREAKING ASIDE BOUND THEMSELVES UP WITH THE
TENSE SILENT PREOCCUPATION WHICH UNHURT MEN GOING FORWARD FIND SO
HARD TO BEAR MOBS OF BEWILDERED GERMANS HAD CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR
SHELTERS IN THE CANAL FLANKS AND WERE TRYING TO SURRENDER TO ANY ONE
WHO LOOKED LIKELY TO ATTEND TO THEM THEY SALUTED BRITISH OFFICERS AS
THEY RACED PAST AND BETWEEN SALUTES RETURNED THEIR ARMS STIFFLY
TO THE SAFE KAMERAD POSITION THIS ADDED THE LAST TOUCH OF INSANITY
TO THE PICTURE WED HA LAUGHED IF WE HAD HAD THE TIME YELL
UNDERSTAND

NONE RECALL PRECISELY HOW THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE CANAL BUT
THERE WERE A FEW MOMENTS OF BLESSED SHELTER ERE THEY SCRAMBLED OUT
AND REFORMED ON THE FAR SIDE THE SHELLING HERE WAS BAD ENOUGH BUT
NOTHING TO WHAT THEY HAD SURVIVED A VEIL OF GREASY SMOKE PATCHED
WITH FLAME THAT DID NOT GLARE STOOD UP BEHIND THEM AND THROUGH
THE PALL OF IT IN LITTLE KNOTS STUMBLED THEIR SUPPORTS BLINDED
CHOKING GASPING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ATTACK ACROSS A LONG
STRETCH OF BROKEN RISING GROUND WERE MORE SHELLS BUT LESS THICKLY
SPACED AND CRATERS OF STINKING EARTH AND COLOURED CHALKS WHERE OUR
BARRAGE HAD RIPPED OUT NESTS OF MACHINEGUNS FAR OFF TO THE LEFT
CREAMING WITH YELLOW SMOKE IN THE MORNING LIGHT ROSE THE SULLEN HEAD
OF BOURLON WOOD TO WHICH THE CANADIANS WERE FAITHFULLY PAYING THE
DEBT CONTRACTED BY THE 2ND BATTALION OF THE IRISH GUARDS IN THE OLD
DAYS AFTER CAMBRAI

AT THE CREST OF THE ASCENT LAY SAUNDERS KEEP WHICH MARKED THE POINT
WHERE THE SCOTS GUARDS WOULD LIE UP AND THE IRISH COME THROUGH
ALREADY THE CASUALTIES HAD BEEN SEVERE CAPTAIN BENCEJONES AND
2ND LIEUTENANT MATHIESON OF NO 2 COMPANY WERE WOUNDED AT THE KEEP
ITSELF AND 2ND LIEUTENANT A R BOYLE OF NO 1 EARLIER IN THE RUSH
THE COMPANIES PANTED UP GAPPED AND STRUNG OUT FROM THE KEEP THE
LAND SLOPED DOWN TO STAFFORD ALLEY THE BATTALIONS FIRST OBJECTIVE
JUST BEFORE WHICH LIEUTENANT BARRY CLOSE WAS KILLED THAT DAY MARKED
HIS COMING OF AGE BEYOND THE ALLEY THE GROUND ROSE AGAIN AND HERE
THE IRISH WERE FIRST CHECKED BY SOME MACHINEGUN FIRE THAT HAD
ESCAPED OUR BARRAGES SECOND LIEUTENANT OBRIEN NO 3 COMPANY WAS
HIT AT THIS POINT WHILE GETTING HIS MEN FORWARD HE HAD EARNED HIS
MILITARY CROSS IN MAY AND HE DIED WELL THE NEXT SENIOR OFFICER
2ND LIEUTENANT E H R BURKE WAS AWAY TO THE LEFT IN THE THICK OF
THE SMOKE WITH A PLATOON THAT LIKE THE REST WAS FIGHTING FOR ITS
LIFE SO 2ND LIEUTENANT OFARRELL LED ON HE WAS HIT NOT FAR FROM
STAFFORD ALLEY AND WHILE HIS WOUND WAS BEING BANDAGED BY SERGEANT
REGAN HIT AGAIN BY A BULLET THAT PASSING THROUGH THE SERGEANTS
CAP AND A FINGER ENTERED OFARRELLS HEART THE OFFICER COMMANDING
THE REMNANTS OF THE MORTAR BATTERY TOOK ON THE COMPANY AND HIS ONE
GUN MEANTIME COLLETT AND A FEW OF NO 3 COMPANY HAD REACHED SILVER
STREET A TRENCH RUNNING FORWARD FROM STAFFORD ALLEY AND HE AND
LIEUTENANT BRADY WERE BOMBING DOWN IT UNDER HEAVY SMALLARM FIRE FROM
THE ENEMYS LEFT FLANK WHICH HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN IN AND WAS GIVING
UNTOLD TROUBLE NO 2 COMPANY WITH TWO OUT OF THREE OF ITS OFFICERS
DOWN WAS WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME LINE AS THE FRAGMENT OF NO 3
THOUGH OPINION WAS DIVIDED ON THAT CONFUSED FIELD WHETHER IT WOULD
NOT BE BETTER FOR THEM TO LIE DOWN AND FORM A DEFENSIVE FLANK AGAINST
THAT PESTILENT LEFT FIRE EVENTUALLY BUT EVENTS SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER
LIKE THE BULLETS COLLETT AND HIS MEN REACHED THEIR LAST OBJECTIVEA
TRENCH RUNNING OUT OF SILVER STREET TOWARDS FLESQUIRES HERE HE
BRADY AND BALDWIN DREW BREATH AND TRIED TO GET AT THE SITUATION
NO 4 COMPANY LAY TO THE RIGHT OF NO 3 AND WHEN 2ND LIEUTENANT E
H R BURKE WITH WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS PLATOON BEFORE MENTIONED
CAME UP HE RESUMED CHARGE OF IT WITHOUT A WORD AND WENT ON NO 1
COMPANY LIEUTENANT THE HON B A A OGILVY HAD LIKE THE REST
BEEN COMPELLED TO LEAD ITS OWN LIFE ITS OBJECTIVE WAS THE BEETSUGAR
FACTORY IN FRONT OF FLESQUIRES AHEAD OF AND A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT
OF THE BATTALIONS FINAL OBJECTIVE AND IT WAS MET THROUGHOUT WITH
RIFLE BOMB AND FLANKING FIRE LIEUTENANT OGILVY WAS WOUNDED AT
A CRITICAL POINT IN THE GAME WITH THE ENEMY WELL INTO THE TRENCH
OR TRENCHES THE WHOLE GROUND SEEMED TO THE MEN WHO WERE CLEARING
IT ONE INEXHAUSTIBLE HUNWARREN AS HE DROPPED LIEUTENANT R L
DAGGER AND SERGEANT CONABOY PICKING UP WHAT MEN THEY COULD BOMBED
THE ENEMY OUT BACK AND AWAY AND SETTLED DOWN TO DIG IN AND WAIT
ALWAYS UNDER FLANKFIRE THE SERGEANT WAS KILLED IN HIS ZEAL TO
FINISH THE JOB COMPLETELYNO MEAN EPITAPH FOR A THOROUGH MAN BY
ELEVEN OCLOCK THAT MORNING ALL THE COMPANIES HAD REACHED THEIR
OBJECTIVES AND THOUGH SORELY HARASSED BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE WORST
FOR THEM MIGHT BE OVER THERE WERE HOWEVER TWO GERMAN WHIZZBANGS
THAT LIVED IN ORIVAL WOOD STILL UNTAKEN ON THE BATTALIONS LEFT AND
THESE SERVED WITH DISGUSTING SPEED AND ACCURACY SWEPT SILVER STREET
MERCILESSLY THE SITUATION WAS NOT IMPROVED WHEN ONE OF THE SERGEANTS
QUOTED THE EVERFAMOUS SAYING OF SERGEANTMAJOR TOHER WITH REFERENCE
TO ONE OF OUR OWN BARRAGES AND EVEN THE WURRUMS THEMSELVES ARE
GETTING UP AND CRYING FOR MERCY THE GUNS WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO WATCH
QUITE COMFORTABLY AND WHILE THE MEN WATCHED AND WINCED THEY SAW
THE SUCCESS SIGNAL OF THE CANADIANSTHREE WHITESRISE HIGH IN
AIR IN FRONT OF BOURLON WOOD THEN NO 1 COMPANY REPORTED THEY WERE
GETTING MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF MACHINEGUN FIRE AND THE 1ST GUARDS
BRIGADE TRENCH MORTAR BATTERY REDUCED TO ONE MORTAR ONE OFFICER
ONE SERGEANT FOUR MEN AND TEN SHELLS BESTOWED THE WHOLE OF ITS
AMMUNITION IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED ABANDONED ITS MORTAR AND
MERGED ITSELF INTO THE RANKS OF NO 3 COMPANY IT HAD BEEN AMPLY
PROVED THAT WHERE TRENCHMORTARS ACCOMPANY A FIRST WAVE OF ATTACK IF
MEN ARE HIT WHILE CARRYING TWO STOKES SHELLS APIECE FORTY POUNDS OF
EXPLOSIVES THEY BECOME DANGEROUS MOBILE MINES

ENEMY AEROPLANES NOW SWOOPED DOWN WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE THERE SEEMED
NO WAY OF GETTING OUR ARTILLERY TO ATTEND TO THEM AND THEY PECKED
LIKE VULTURES UNDISTURBED THEN BATTALION HEADQUARTERS CAME UP IN
THE MIDST OF THE FIRING FROM THE LEFT ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN
A DUGOUT AND WERE AT ONCE VIGOROUSLY SHELLED TOGETHER WITH THE
NEIGHBOURING AIDPOST AND SOME GERMAN PRISONERS THERE WAITING TO
CARRY DOWN WOUNDED THE AIDPOST WAS IN CHARGE OF A YOUNG AMERICAN
DOCTOR RHYS DAVIS BY NAME WHO HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO THE BATTALION
FOR SOME TIME THIS WAS HIS FIRST DAY OF WAR AND HE WAS MORTALLY
WOUNDED BEFORE THE NOON OF IT

THE TRENCH FILLED AS THE DAY WENT ON WITH DETAILS DROPPING IN BY
DEVIOUS AND HURRIED ROADS TO MEET THE CONTINUAL STREAM OF PRISONERS
BEING HANDED DOWN TO BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS ONE YOUTH WHO COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN SEVENTEEN FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF AN OFFICER AND
CRIED KAMERAD HERR OFFIZIER ICH BIN SEHR JUNG KAMERAD TO
WHOM THE EMBARRASSED ISLANDER SAID BRUTALLY GET ON WITH YOU I
WOULDNT TOUCH YOU FOR THE WORLD AND THEY LAUGHED ALL ALONG THE
TRENCHFACE AS THEY DODGED THE WHIZZBANGS OUT OF ORIVAL WOOD AND
COMPARED THEMSELVES TO THE WURRUMS BEGGING FOR MERCY

ABOUT NOON AFTER MANY ADVENTURES THE 2ND GRENADIERS ARRIVED
TO CARRY ON THE ADVANCE AND SILVER STREET BECAME A CONGESTED
METROPOLIS THE 2ND GRENADIERS WERE HUNG UP THERE FOR A WHILE
BECAUSE THOUGH THE THIRD DIVISION ON THE RIGHT HAD TAKEN
FLESQUIRES THE SIXTYTHIRD ON THE LEFT HAD NOT GOT GRAINCOURT
VILLAGE WHICH WAS ENFILADING THE LANDSCAPE DAMNABLY ORIVAL WOOD
TOO WAS UNTAKEN AND THE 1ST GRENADIERS UNDER LORD GORT WERE OUT
UNSUPPORTED HALF A MILE AHEAD ON THE RIGHT FRONT SOMEWHERE NEAR PREMY
CHAPEL MEANTIME A BATTALION OF THE SECOND DIVISION WHICH WAS TO
COME THROUGH THE GUARDS DIVISION AND CONTINUE THE ADVANCE FLOODED UP
SILVER STREET ZEALOUSLY UNREELING ITS TELEPHONE WIRES MACHINEGUN
GUARDS WERE THERE LOOKING FOR POSITIONS THE 2ND GRENADIERS WERE
STANDING READY THE WELSH GUARDS WERE ALSO THERE WITH INTENT TO
SUPPORT THE GRENADIERS WALKING WOUNDED WERE COMING DOWN AND SEVERE
CASES WERE BEING CARRIED OVER THE TOP BY GERMAN PRISONERS WHO MADE
NO SECRET OF AN ACUTE DESIRE TO LIVE AND JUMPED IN AMONG THE REST
WITHOUT LEAVE ASKED THE MEN COMPARED THE CRUSH TO A SUGARQUEUE AT
HOME TO CAP EVERYTHING SOME WANDERING TANKS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO
THE DIVISION ON THE RIGHT HAD STRAYED OVER TO THE LEFT NO GERMAN
BATTERY CAN RESIST TANKS HOWEVER DISABLED SO THEY DREW FIRE AND
WHEN THEY WERE KNOCKED OUT OUR PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THIS AT FIRST
BEING UNUSED TO WORKING WITH THEM MADE LIFE INSUPPORTABLE WITH
PETROLFUMES FOR A HUNDRED YARDS ROUND

ABOUT HALFPAST FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON A GUARDS BATTALIONTHEY
THOUGHT IT WAS THE 1ST COLDSTREAMCAME UP ON THEIR LEFT AND UNDER
COVER OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SMOKEBARRAGE CLEARED ORIVAL WOOD AND
SILENCED THE TWO GUNS THERE THE IRISH FROM THEIR DRESSCIRCLE IN
SILVER STREET BLESSED THEM LONG AND LOUD AND WHILE THEY APPLAUDED
LIEUTCOLONEL LORD GORT COMMANDING THE 1ST GRENADIERS CAME DOWN
THE TRENCH WOUNDED ON HIS WAY TO A DRESSINGSTATION HE HAD BEEN
BADLY HIT ONCE BEFORE HE THOUGHT FIT TO LEAVE DUTY AND WAS SUFFERING
FROM LOSS OF BLOOD THE IRISH HAD ALWAYS A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM AND
THAT DAY THEY OWED HIM MORE THAN THEY KNEW AT THE TIME FOR IT WAS
THE ADVANCE OF THE 1ST GRENADIERS UNDER HIS LEADING ALMOST UP TO
PREMY CHAPEL WHICH HAD UNKEYED THE GERMAN RESISTANCE IN GRAINCOURT
AND LED THE ENEMY TO BELIEVE THEIR LINE OF RETREAT OUT OF THE VILLAGE
WAS THREATENED THE SECOND DIVISION AS IT CAME THROUGH FOUND THE
ENEMY SHIFTING AND FOLLOWED THEM UP TOWARDS NOYELLES SO THE DAY
CLOSED AND THOUGH MEN DID NOT REALIZE MARKED THE END OF ORGANIZED
TRENCHWARFARE FOR THE GUARDS DIVISION

THE BATTALION WITH TWO OFFICERS DEAD AND FIVE WOUNDED OUT OF
FIFTEEN KILLED LIEUTENANT B S CLOSE AND 2ND LIEUTENANT A H
OFARRELL WOUNDED CAPTAIN THE HON B A A OGILVY CAPTAIN C W
W BENCEJONES AND 2ND LIEUTENANTS A R BOYLE G F MATHIESON
AND C S OBRIEN MC DIED OF WOUNDS AND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
CASUALTIES IN THE RANKS STAYED ON THE GROUND FOR THE NIGHT IT
TRIED TO MAKE ITSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS COLD AND SHALLOW TRENCHES
ALLOWED BUT BY ORDERS OF SOME HIGHER AUTHORITY WHO SUPPOSED THAT
IT HAD BEEN RELIEVED NO WATER OR RATIONS WERE SENT UP AND NEXT
MORNING THEY HAD TO MARCH SIX THOUSAND YARDS ON EMPTY STOMACHS TO
THEIR TRENCHSHELTERS AND BIVOUACS IN FRONT OF DEMICOURT AS THE LAST
COMPANY ARRIVED A COLD RAIN FELL BUT THEY WERE ALL IN REASONABLY
HIGH SPIRITS IT HAD BEEN A WINNING ACTION IN SPITE OF TRENCHWORK
AND MEN REALLY FELT THAT THEY HAD THE RUNNING IN THEIR OWN HANDS AT
LAST

BACKAREA RUMOURS AND OFFICIAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE GOOD TOO THE
NINETEENTH AND SECOND CORPS OF THE SECOND ARMY TOGETHER WITH THE
BELGIAN ARMY HAD ATTACKED ON THE 28TH SEPTEMBER FROM DIXMUDE TO FAR
SOUTH OF THE YPRESZONNEBEKE ROAD HAD RETAKEN ALL THE HEIGHTS TO THE
EAST OF YPRES AND WERE IN A FAIR WAY TO CLEAR OUT EVERY GERMAN GAIN
THERE OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS A GERMAN WITHDRAWAL WAS BEGINNING FROM
LENS TO ARMENTIRES AND TO THE SOUTH OF THE THIRD ARMY THE FOURTH
CAME IN ON THE 29TH WHILE THE BATTALION WAS RESTING AND SHAVING
IN ITS TRENCHSHELTERS BY DEMICOURT ON A FRONT OF TWELVE MILES AND
FROM GRICOURT TO VENDHUILLE BROKE AND POURED ACROSS THE HINDENBURG
LINE THEN TO THE ST QUENTIN CANAL AT THE SAME TIME LEST THERE
SHOULD BE ONE FURLONG OF THE UNEASY FRONT NEGLECTED THE FIFTH AND
SIXTH CORPS OF THE THIRD ARMY ATTACKED OVER THE OLD GOUZEAUCOURT
GROUND BETWEEN VENDHUILLE AND MARCOING THIS TOO WITHOUT COUNTING
THE BLOWS THAT THE FRENCH AND THE AMERICANS WERE DEALING IN THEIR OWN
SPHERES ON THE MEUSE AND IN THE ARGONNE EACH STROKE COLDLY PREPARING
THE NEXT

THE GERMANS HAD DURING SEPTEMBER LOST A QUARTER OF A MILLION
OF PRISONERS SEVERAL THOUSAND GUNS AND IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF
IRREPLACEABLE STORES THEIR MAIN LINE OF RESISTANCE WAS BROKEN AND
OVERRUN THROUGHOUT AND THEIR TROOPS IN THE FIELD WERE FEELING THE
DEMORALISATION OF CONSTANT WITHDRAWALS AS WELL AS SHORTAGE FROM
ABANDONED SUPPLIES OUR PEOPLE HAD KNOWN THE SAME DEPRESSION IN
THE MARCH PUSH WHEN NIGHT SKIES LIT WITH BURNING DUMPS GAVE THE
IMPRESSION THAT ALL THE WORLD WAS GOING UP IN UNIVERSAL SURRENDER


TOWARDS MAUBEUGE

BUT WORK WAS STILL TO DO BETWEEN CAMBRAI WHICH AT THE END OF
OCTOBER WAS UNDER THOUGH NOT ACTUALLY IN OUR HANDS AND MAUBEUGE
LAY THIRTYFIVE MILES OF FRANCE ALL OPEN SAVE FOR SUCH HASTILY MADE
DEFENCES AS THE ENEMY HAD BEEN ABLE TO THROW UP AFTER THE COLLAPSE
OF THE HINDENBURG SYSTEMS THERE THEN THE SCREW WAS TURNED AND
ON THE 8TH OCTOBER THE THIRD AND FOURTH ARMIES ATTACKED ON A FRONT
OF SEVENTEEN MILES FROM SEQUEHART NORTH OF CAMBRAI WHERE THE
CAMBRAIDOUAI ROAD CROSSES THE SENSE SOUTHWARD TO OUR JUNCTION WITH
THE FRENCH FIRST ARMY A FEW MILES ABOVE ST QUENTIN TWENTY BRITISH
DIVISIONS TWO CAVALRY DIVISIONS AND ONE AMERICAN DIVISION WERE
INVOLVED THE BATTALION FACED THE CHANGED MILITARY SITUATION BY
ANNOUNCING THAT COMPANIES WERE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THEIR COMMANDERS
FOR OPEN WARFARE TRAINING AFTER WHICH THEY WERE INSTANTLY SENT
FORWARD FROM THEIR DEMICOURT TRENCHES TO HELP MAKE ROADS BETWEEN
HAVRICOURT AND FLESQUIRES

ON THE 3RD OCTOBER THEY HAD ORDERS TO MOVE WHICH WERE AT ONCE
CANCELLEDSURE SIGN THAT THE HIGHER COMMAND HAD SOMETHING ON ITS
MIND THIS WAS PROVED TWO DAYS LATER WHEN THE SAME ORDERS ARRIVED
AGAIN AND WERE AGAIN WASHED OUT MEANTIME THEIR REORGANISATION
AFTER THE FLESQUIRES FIGHT HAD BEEN COMPLETED REINFORCEMENTS WERE
UP AND THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS HAD JOINED FOR DUTY LIEUTENANTS H
E VAN DER NOOT AND G F VAN DER NOOT AND 2ND LIEUTENANTS A L W
KOCH DE GOOREYND THE HON C A BARNEWALL G M TYLDENWRIGHT V
J S FRENCH AND R E TAYLOR

ON THE 4TH OCTOBER THE COMMANDING OFFICER WENT ON LEAVE AND MAJOR
A F L GORDON MC TOOK COMMAND OF THE BATTALION ONCE MORE IT
WAS WARNED THAT IT WOULD MOVE NEXT DAY WHICH WARNING THIS TIME
CAME TRUE AND WAS HERALDED BY THE USUAL CONFERENCE AT BRIGADE
HEADQUARTERS ON THE 7TH OCTOBER WHEN THE PLANS FOR NEXT DAYS
BATTLE IN THAT SECTOR OF THE LINE WERE REVEALED THE SECOND DIVISION
ON THE LEFT AND THE THIRD ON THE RIGHT OF THE GUARDS DIVISION WERE
TO ATTACK ON THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF THE SIXTH CORPS AT DAWN OF
THE 8TH OCTOBER THE GUARDS DIVISION WAS TO BE READY TO GO THROUGH
THESE TWO DIVISIONS ON THE AFTERNOON OF THAT DAY OR TO TAKE OVER
THE LINE ON THE NIGHT OF IT AND CONTINUE THE ATTACK AT DAWN ON THE
9TH THE 1ST GUARDS BRIGADE WOULD PASS THROUGH THE THIRD DIVISION
AND THE 2ND BRIGADE THROUGH THE SECOND DIVISION AS FAR AS THE 1ST
BRIGADES ATTACK WAS CONCERNED THE 2ND COLDSTREAM WOULD TAKE THE
RIGHT THE 2ND GRENADIERS THE LEFT OF THE LINE WITH THE 1ST IRISH
GUARDS IN RESERVE IT WAS ALL BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR SO THE BATTALION
LEFT DEMICOURT RECROSSED THE CANAL DU NORD AT LOCK 7 AND WERE
ACCOMMODATED IN DUGOUTS AND SHELTERS IN THE HINDENBURG LINE NEAR
RIBECOURT

ON THE 9TH OCTOBER THE BATTALION MOVED TO MASNIRES FOUR MILES OR SO
SOUTH OF CAMBRAI HERE WHILE CROSSING THE ST QUENTIN CANAL NO 3
COMPANY HAD THREE KILLED AND THREE WOUNDED BY A LONGRANGE GUN WHICH
WAS SHELLING ALL DOWN THE LINE OF IT THEY HALTED IN THE OPEN FOR
THE REST OF THE DAY A CURIOUS EXPERIENCE FOLLOWED THE IDEA WAS TO
ATTACK IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF CATTENIRES ACROSS THE LINE OF
THE CAMBRAICAUDRY RAILWAY WHICH WITH ITS EMBANKMENT AND CUTTINGS
WAS EXPECTED TO GIVE TROUBLE THE NEW ZEALAND DIVISION WAS THEN ON
THE RIGHT OF THE GUARDS DIVISION BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO BE SURE THE
NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE WHETHER THE THIRD DIVISION WAS OUT ON THEIR
FRONT OR NOT EVERYTHING YELL UNDERSTAND WAS ALL LOOSED UP IN
THOSE DAYS JERRY DID NOT KNOW HIS MIND AND FOR THAT REASON WE
COULD NOT KNOW OURS THE BOTTOM WAS OUT OF THE WAR YELL UNDERSTAND
BUT WE DID NOT SEE IT HOWEVER IT WAS ARRANGED THAT ALL TROOPS
WOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM DOUBTFUL AREAS BEFORE ZERO 510 A M AND
THAT THE 2ND COLDSTREAM AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS WOULD ADVANCE TO THE
ATTACK UNDER A CREEPING BARRAGE WITH DUE PRECAUTIONS WHICH INCLUDED A
PLENTIFUL BOMBARDMENT AND MACHINEGUNNING OF THE RAILWAY EMBANKMENT

THE BATTALION IN RESERVE AS HAS BEEN SAID MOVED FROM MASNIRES
TO ITS ASSEMBLY AREA AMONG OLD GERMAN TRENCHES NEAR THE VILLAGE
OF SERANVILLERS IN ARTILLERY FORMATION AT 240 A M AND HAD ITS
BREAKFAST AT 5 A M WHILE THE OTHER TWO BATTALIONS OF THE BRIGADE
ADVANCED IN WAVES PRECEDED BY STRONG PATROLS AND BACKED BY THE GUNS
THERE WAS NO SHELLING WHILE THEY ASSEMBLED AND PRACTICALLY NONE IN
REPLY TO OUR BARRAGE NOR DID THE LEADING BATTALIONS MEET OPPOSITION
TILL AFTER THEY HAD CLEARED OUT THE VILLAGE OF SERANVILLERS AND
WERE HELD UP BY SCREENED MACHINEGUNS IN A WOOD SURROUNDING A
SUGARFACTORY NORTH OF CATTENIRES THE BATTALION FOLLOWED ON IN DUE
COURSE REACHED THE RAILWAY EMBANKMENT SET UP HEADQUARTERS IN A
ROADTUNNEL UNDER IT THERE WAS NO FIRING AND RECEIVED TELEPHONIC
ORDERS THAT AT 5 A M ON THE 10TH OCTOBER THEY WOULD PASS THROUGH
THE OTHER TWO BATTALIONS AND CONTINUE THE ADVANCE WHICH HENCEFORTH
WAS TO BE BY BOUNDS AND WITHOUT LIMIT OR BARRAGE THEN THEY LAY UP
IN THE RAILWAY EMBANKMENT AND DOZED

THEY ASSEMBLED NEXT MORNING THE 10TH IN THE DARK AND REINFORCED
BY SEVEN CORPS CYCLISTS AND A BATTERY OF FIELDGUNS WENT FORTH
INTO FRANCE AT LARGE AFTER A RETIRING ENEMY NOTHING HAPPENED
FOR A COUPLE OF MILES WHEN THEY REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF
BEAUVAISENCAMBRENSIS ON THE CAMBRAILECATEAU ROAD WHERE A SINGLE
SNIPER FROM ONE OF THE HOUSES SHOT AND KILLED 2ND LIEUTENANT V J
S FRENCH NO 4 COMPANY A MILE FARTHER ON UP THE BEAUVAISQUIVY
ROAD THEY FOUND THE VILLAGE OF BEVILLERS HEAVILY SHELLED BY THE
ENEMY FROM A DISTANCE SO SKIRTED ROUND IT AND SENT IN TWO SMALL
MOPPINGUP PARTIES HERE NO 4 COMPANY AGAIN CAME UP AGAINST
MACHINEGUN AND SNIPER FIRE BUT NO CASUALTIES FOLLOWED THEIR
PATROLS REPORTED THE NEXT BOUND ALL CLEAR AND THEY PUSHED ON UNDER
HEAVY BUT HARMLESS SHELLING IN THE DIRECTION OF QUIVY AT EIGHT
OCLOCK THEIR PATROLS WAKED UP A BREADTH OF MACHINEGUN NESTS ALONG
THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT AND THAT OF THE BATTALIONS TO THEIR LEFT AND
RIGHT THEY WENT TO GROUND ACCORDINGLY AND WHEN THE ENEMY ARTILLERY
WAS ADDED TO THE SMALLARM FIRE THE MEN DUG SLITS FOR THEMSELVES
AND ESCAPED TROUBLE FOR SOME TIME PAST THE GERMAN SHELLSTUFF HAD
BEEN GROWING LESS AND LESS EFFECTIVE BOTH IN ACCURACY AND BURSTING
POWER WHICH KNOWLEDGE CHEERED OUR TROOPS IN THE AFTERNOON AS THERE
WERE SIGNS OF THE RESISTANCE WEAKENING OUR PATROLS PUT FORTH ONCE
MORE AND BY FIVE OCLOCK THE BATTALION HAD REACHED THE THIRD BOUND
ON THE FULL BATTALION FRONT THEN IN THE DUSK CAME WORD FROM THE
NEW ZEALAND DIVISION ON THEIR RIGHT THAT THE DIVISION ON THEIR
RIGHT AGAIN HAD GOT FORWARD AND THAT THE NEW ZEALANDERS WERE
PUSHING ON TO HIGH GROUND SOUTH OF QUIVY WITH THE MESSAGE CAME ONE
FROM NO 4 COMPANY REPORTING THAT THEIR PATROLS WERE OUT AHEAD AND
IN TOUCH WITH THE NEW ZEALANDERS ON THEIR RIGHT THERE IS NO RECORD
THAT THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM SINCE IT MEANT BOUNDING
ON IN THE DARK TO THE FOURTH BOUND WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISHED NOT
BEFORE 1030 THAT NIGHT TIRED OFFICERS HUNTING UP TIRED COMPANIES BY
HAND AND SHOVING THEM INTO THEIR POSITIONS THESE WERE ON HIGH GROUND
NORTHEAST OF QUIVY WITH THE BATTALIONS RIGHT ON A FARM CALLED
FONTAINEAUTERTRE WHICH SIGNIFIES THE FOUNTAIN ON THE LITTLE
HILL A MILE BEYOND THE VILLAGE THE 1ST SCOTS GUARDS WERE ON THEIR
LEFT HOLDING THE VILLAGE OF ST HILAIRELESCAMBRAI THEN PUNCTUAL
AS EVER RATIONS CAME UP BATTALION HEADQUARTERS ESTABLISHED ITSELF
IN A REAL ROOFED HOUSE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF QUIVY AND NO 1 COMPANY
IN RESERVE WAS BILLETED IN THE VILLAGE

NEXT MORNING 11TH OCTOBER WHEN THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE CAME THROUGH
THEM AND ATTACKED OVER THE NAKED GRASS AND STUBBLE FIELDS TOWARDS ST
PYTHON AND SOLESMES THE BATTALION WAS WITHDRAWN AND SENT TO VERY
GOOD BILLETS IN QUIVY THE MEN HAVING BOTH UPSTAIRS AND CELLAR
ROOM ALL BILLETS VERY DIRTY SAYS THE DIARY OWING TO THE PREVIOUS
OCCUPANTS HUN APPARENTLY HAVING TAKEN DELIGHT IN SCATTERING ALL THE
CIVILIAN CLOTHES FOOD FURNITURE ETC ALL OVER THE PLACE EVERY
ONE WAS TIRED OUT THEY HAD HARDLY SLEPT FOR THREE NIGHTS BUT ALL
WERE IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS HAD FOUND WHAT
WAS DESCRIBED AS A MAGNIFICENT HOUSE WITH A MOST COMFORTABLE BED
IN A LARGE ROOM THOSE WHO USED IT WERE LYRIC IN THEIR LETTERS HOME

THE TOTAL CASUALTIES FOR THE 10TH AND 11TH OCTOBER WERE AMAZINGLY

THEY LAY AT QUIVY FOR THE NEXT WEEK EMPLOYED IN CLEANING UP DIRTY
BILLETS WHILE THE 3RD AND 2ND BRIGADES OF THE DIVISION WERE CLEANING
OUT THE ENEMY REARGUARDS IN FRONT OF THEM FROM THE WEST BANK OF
THE SELLE RIVER AND ROADS AND RAILWAYS WERE STRETCHING OUT BEHIND
OUR ARMIES TO BRING REDOUBLED SUPPLY OF MATERIAL ONE OF THE EXTRA
FATIGUES OF THOSE DAYS WAS TO GET THE CIVIL POPULATION OUT OF THE
VILLAGES THAT THE ENEMY WERE ABANDONING THIS HAD TO BE DONE BY
NIGHT FOR THERE IS SMALL CHIVALRY IN THE GERMAN COMPOSITION QUIVY
WAS SHELLED AT INTERVALS AND NO PARADES LARGER THAN OF A PLATOON
WERE THEREFORE ALLOWED THE WEATHER TOO STOPPED A SCHEME OF
FIELDOPERATIONS IN THE BACK AREA BETWEEN QUIVY AND BEVILLERS AND
A WASHED AND CLEANLY CLOTHED BATTALION WERE GRATEFUL TO THEIR SAINTS
FOR BOTH RELIEFS

ON THE 17TH OCTOBER THE SIXTYFIRST DIVISION TOOK OVER THE GUARDS
AREA AND THAT AFTERNOON THE BATTALION LEFT QUIVY BY CROSSCOUNTRY
TRACKS FOR BOUSSIRES AND MOVED INTO POSITION FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO
BE ALL BUT THE LAST STROKE OF THE LONG GAME

THE ENEMY ON THAT FRONT WERE BY NOW ACROSS THE STEEPLY BANKED SELLE
RIVER BUT THE LARGE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OF SOLESMES OF WHICH ST
PYTHON IS PRACTICALLY A SUBURB WAS STILL HELD BY THEM AND WOULD HAVE
TO BE CLEANED OUT HOUSETOHOUSE MOREOVER IT WAS KNOWN TO BE FULL
OF FRENCH CIVILS AND GETTING THEM AWAY IN SAFETY WOULD NOT MAKE THE
SITUATION LESS DIFFICULT


ST PYTHON

IT WAS GIVEN OUT AT BRIGADE CONFERENCE ON THE 17TH THAT THE
SIXTYFIRST DIVISION WOULD TAKE PLACE ON THE RIGHT OF THE GUARDS
DIVISION AND THE NINETEENTH ON ITS LEFT IN THE FORTHCOMING ATTACK
AND THAT THE SIXTYFIRST WOULD ATTEND TO SOLESMES WHILE THE GUARDS
DIVISION PUSHED ON NORTHEAST BETWEEN ST PYTHON AND HAUSSY ON A
MILEWIDE FRONT THROUGH THE VILLAGE OF ESCARMAIN TO CAPELLE A
DISTANCE OF SOME THREE AND A HALF MILES THE 1ST AND 3RD BRIGADES
WOULD LEAD THE 2ND IN RESERVE AND THE PASSAGE OF THE SELLE WOULD BE
EFFECTED IN THE DARK BY SUCH BRIDGES AS THE SAPPERS COULD PUT UP

THE BATTALION MOVED NEARER THEIR ASSEMBLY AREAS TO ST
HILAIRELESCAMBRAI ON THE NIGHT OF THE 18TH AFTER COMPANY
COMMANDERS HAD THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED TO THEIR MEN WHAT WAS IN STORE
AND ON THE 19TH THOSE COMMANDERS WITH THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
CAPTAIN VERNON WENT UP TO HIGH GROUND OVERLOOKING THE BATTLEFIELD
IT WAS A CLOSER AND MORE CRUMPLED LAND THAN THEY HAD DEALT WITH
HITHERTO ITS STEEPSIDED VALLEYS CUT BY A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE
STREAMS RUNNING FROM NORWEST TO SOUTHEAST WITH THE INTERMINABLE
RULED LINE OF THE BAVAI ROAD EDGING THE GREAT FOREST OF MORMAL WHICH
LAY NORTH OF LANDRECIES THE WHEEL WAS SWINGING FULL CIRCLE AND
MEN WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN THAT AGEAGO RETREAT FROM MONS AMUSED
THEMSELVES BY TRYING TO PICK OUT FAMILIAR DETAILS IN THE LANDSCAPE
THEY HAD BEEN HUNTED ACROSS FOUR YEARS BEFORE BUT IT WAS MISTY AND
THE WEATHER FAITHFUL ALLY OF THE GERMANS TO THE LAST WAS BREAKING
AGAIN JUST AS THE BATTALION MOVED OFF FROM ST HILAIRE TO THEIR
AREA ON THE RAILWAY LINE FROM VALENCIENNES TO LE CATEAU RAIN BEGAN
AND CONTINUED TILL SIX NEXT MORNING MAKING EVERY CONDITION FOR
ATTACK AS VILE AS IT COULD THEY DUG THEM SHALLOW TRENCHES IN CASE OF
SHELLFIRE AND SENT DOWN PARTIES TO RECONNOITRE THE BRIDGES OVER THE
SELLE FOUR BRIDGES WERE AVAILABLE IE EXISTED IN SOME SHAPE
ON OR NEAR THE BATTALION FRONT BUT NO ONE HAD A GOOD WORD TO SAY FOR
ANY OF THEM

THERE IS A TALE CONCERNING THE RIVERS HERE WHICH MAY BE GIVEN
WITHOUT GUARANTEE SUBSTANTIALLY AS TOLD RIVERS ROUND MAUBEUGE
TWAS ALL RIVERSTHE AUNELLE AND THE RHNELLE AND THE PRONELLE
AN MORE TOO AN OUR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER DESIRIN TO KNOW THE
LAST WORD CONCERNIN EACH ONE OF EM BEFORE WE PADDLED IT MICHAEL
AN ME WAS FOR THAT DUTY MICHAEL WAS A RUNNER AFRAID O NOTHING
BUT NO SMALL LIAR AND HIM AS FED AS MYSELF WITH REPORTIN ON THESE
SAME DAM RIVERS AND JERRY EXPENDIN THE LAST OF HIS SMALLARM STUFF
ROUND AND ROUND THE COUNTRY I FORGET WHICH RIVER TWAS WE WERE
SCOUTING BUT HE WAS AHEAD OF ME THE WAY HE ALWAYS WAS PRESENTLY

NATURE OF ITS BOTTOM AND THE SCENERY AND ALL AND ALL THE WAY YOUD

MICHAELS RIVER THE WAY HE SAID WE WOULD YE CAN NOT GET WETTER THAN

IT WAS A QUIET NIGHT EXCEPT FOR OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF MACHINEGUN
FIRE BUT THERE WAS NO SHELLING OF THE ASSEMBLY AREA AS THE 2ND
GRENADIERS FORMED UP ON THEIR RIGHT WITH THE 2ND COLDSTREAM IN
RESERVE NOS 1 AND 2 COMPANIES CAPTAIN A W L PAGET AND
LIEUTENANT E M HARVEY MC MOVED OFF FIRST NO 3 IN SUPPORT
CAPTAIN BAMBRIDGE AND NO 4 2ND LIEUTENANT O R BALDWIN IN
RESERVE THE BARRAGE OPENED WITH A PERCENTAGE OF DEMORALISING
FLAMESHELLS THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ARTILLERY RETALIATION AND BEYOND
GETTING RATHER WETTER THAN THE RAIN HAD ALREADY MADE THEM THE
BATTALION DID NOT SUFFER EXCEPT FROM SMALLARM FIRE OUT OF THE DARK
THE FIRST OBJECTIVE A SECTION OF THE SOLESMESVALENCIENNES ROAD
WAS GAINED IN AN HOUR WITH BUT EIGHT CASUALTIES MAINLY FROM OUR
OWN SHORTS IN THE BARRAGE AND SEVERAL PRISONERS AND MACHINEGUNS
CAPTURED THE PRISONERS SHOWED NO WISH TO FIGHT

THE COMPANIES HAD KEPT DIRECTION WONDERFULLY WELL IN THE DARK AND
REACHED THE SECOND AND LAST OBJECTIVE UNDER INCREASED MACHINEGUN
FIRE BUT STILL WITHOUT MUCH ARTILLERY THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE ON
THEIR LEFT HAD BEEN HUNG UP ONCE OR TWICE WHICH KEPT NO 2 COMPANY
THE LEFT LEADING COMPANY AND NOS 3 AND 4 IN SUPPORT BUSY AT
ODD TIMES FORMING DEFENSIVE FLANKS AGAINST SNIPING BY HALFPAST
FIVE HOWEVER THEY WERE ALL IN PLACE AND SET TO DIG IN OPPOSITE
THE VILLAGE OF VERTAIN THEN DULL DAY BROKE AND WITH LIGHT CAME
PUNISHMENT THE ENEMY IN PLAIN SIGHT OPENED ON THEM WITH EVERYTHING
THAT THEY HAD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD FROM 7 A M TO 10 P M OF THE
20TH THE TWO FRONT COMPANIES WERE CUT OFF AS LONG AS ONE COULD SEE
AND A GOOD DEAL OF THE STUFF WAS DELIVERED OVER OPEN SIGHTS IT WAS
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET THE WOUNDED AWAY OWING TO THE CONTINUOUS
SNIPING BUT THROUGH PROVIDENCE OR THE DEFECT OF ENEMY AMMUNITION
OR THE DEPTH OF THE SLITS THE MEN HAD DUG CASUALTIES WERE VERY FEW
BATTALION HEADQUARTERS AND THE GROUND WHERE NO 4 COMPANY LAY UP
WERE MOST THOROUGHLY DRENCHED THOUGH AN OFFICER OF NO 3 COMPANY
WHOSE EXPERIENCE WAS LARGE DESCRIBED HIS MENS SHARE AS ABOUT THE
WORST AND MOST ACCURATE SHELLING I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THEY WERE
IN MOST PLACES ONLY A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM A DUGIN ENEMY BENT
ON BLESSING THEM WITH EVERY ROUND LEFT OVER IN THE RETREAT DURING
THE NIGHT WHICH WAS CALMER OUR ARTILLERY DEALT WITH THOSE MIXED
BATTERIES AND GROUPS SO WELL THAT ALTHOUGH NO MAN COULD SHOW A
FINGER ABOVE HIS SHELTER IN SOME OF THE COMPANY AREAS THE SHELLING
NEXT DAY WAS MODERATE THE FORWARD POSTS WERE STILL UNAPPROACHABLE
BUT THEY SENT OUT PATROLS FROM NOS 1 AND 2 COMPANIES TO REPORT ON
THE RIVER HARPIES THE NEXT STREAM TO THE SELLE AND TO KEEP IT
UNDER OBSERVATION THIS WAS AN ENTERPRISE NO COMMANDER WOULD HAVE
DREAMED OF UNDERTAKING EVEN THREE MONTHS AGO THE ENEMY SNIPING WENT
ON THE 2ND COLDSTREAM WHO HAD BEEN MOVED UP TO PROTECT THE RIGHT
FLANK OF THE 2ND GRENADIERS THE SIXTYFIRST DIVISION BEING DELAYED
SOME TIME OVER THE CLEARING UP AND EVACUATION OF SOLESMES WAS NOT
YET ABREAST OF THEM WERE WITHDRAWN TO BILLETS AT ST HILAIRE IN THE
COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON BUT WORD CAME THAT NEITHER THE GRENADIERS
NOR THE IRISH NEED LOOK TO BE RELIEVED IT RAINED TOO AND WAS
FREEZING COLD AT NIGHT ANOTHER EXPERT IN THREE YEARS OF MISERIES
WRITES ONE OF THE WORST PLACES I HAVE EVER BEEN IN HEAVY RAIN ALL
DAY AND NIGHT MORE SHELLING IF WE WERE SEEN MOVING ABOUT HEAVY
RAIN ALL DAY SOAKED THROUGH AND SHIVERING WITH COLD THE DIARY
MORE TEMPERATELY THE MEN WERE NEVER DRY FROM THE TIME THEY LEFT
THEIR BILLETS IN ST HILAIRE ON THE EVENING OF THE 20TH AND THERE
WAS NO SHELTER WHATEVER FOR ANY OF THE COMPANIES SO THEY RELIEVED
THEM DURING THE NIGHT OF THE 21ST FRONT COMPANIES 1 AND 2 RETURNING
TO THE ACCOMMODATION VACATED BY THEIR SUPPORTS 3 AND 4

BATTALION RELIEF CAME WHEN THE 24TH BATTALION ROYAL FUSILIERS SECOND
DIVISION TOOK OVER FROM THEM AND THE GRENADIERS AND GOT INTO
POSITION FOR THEIR ATTACK THE NEXT MORNING AN EARLY AND OBTRUSIVE
MOON MADE IT DIFFICULT TO FETCH AWAY THE FRONTPOSTS AND THOUGH
THE LEADING COMPANY REACHED THE SELLE ON ITS WAY BACK AT A LITTLE
AFTER FIVE THE FULL RELIEF WAS NOT COMPLETED TILL HALFPAST NINE
WHEN THEY HAD TO GET ACROSSCOUNTRY TO THE MAIN ROAD AND PICK UP THE
LORRIES THAT TOOK THEM TO VERY GOOD BILLETS AT CARNIRES THEIR
OWN DETAILS HAD SEEN TO THAT AND THEY ARRIVED SOMEWHERE IN THE
EARLY MORNING BEAT AND FOOTSORE BUT WITHOUT A SINGLE CASUALTY IN
RELIEVING THEIR LOSSES FOR THE WHOLE AFFAIR UP TO THE TIME OF THEIR
RELIEF WERE ONE OFFICER CAPTAIN AND ADJUTANT J B KEENAN WOUNDED
IN THE FACE BY A PIECE OF SHELL THE SOLE CASUALTY AT BATTALION

CLEANING UP BEGAN THE NEXT DAY WHERE FINE WEATHER IN MOST DELIGHTFUL
BILLETS WAS CHEERED BY THE NEWS THAT THE SECOND DIVISIONS ATTACK
ON VERTAIN HAD BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS IN THOSE DAYS THEY LOOKED NO
FURTHER THAN THEIR NEIGHBOURS ON EITHER SIDE

EVERY BATTLE AS HAD BEEN POINTED OUT LEAVES ITS OWN IMPRESSION ST
PYTHON OPENED WITH A WILD BUT EXCITING CHASE IN THE WET AND DARK
WHICH AT FIRST SEEMED TO LEAD STRAIGHT INTO GERMANY IT ENDED AS
IT WERE IN THE SUDDEN RISING OF A CURTAIN OF GREY DANK LIGHT THAT
STRUCK ALL THE ACTORS DUMB AND IMMOBILE FOR AN ENORMOUSLY LONG AND
HUNGRY STRETCH OF TIME DURING WHICH THEY MOSTLY STARED AT WHAT THEY
COULD SEE OF THE SKY ABOVE THEM WHILE THE AIR FILLED WITH DIRT AND
CLODS AND SINGLE SHOTS PECKED AND SNARLED ROUND EVERY STONE OF EACH
MANS LIMITED SKYLINE THE WHOLE ENDING IN A BLUR OF RUNNING WATER
UNDER STARLIGHT THAT WAS WHEN THEY RECROSSED THE SELLE RIVER AND
CONFUSED MEMORIES OF FREEZING TOGETHER IN LUMPS IN LORRIES FOLLOWED
BY A DAZED DAY OF SHELLMADNESS WHEN ALL EARS AND EYES WERE
INTOLERABLY OVERBURDENED WITH ECHOES AND PICTURES AND MEN PREFERRED
TO BE LEFT ALONE BUT THEY WERE WASHED AND CLEANED AND RECLOTHED
WITH ALL SPEED AND HANDED OVER TO THEIR COMPANY OFFICERS FOR THE
DRILL THAT CHASES OFF BAD DREAMS THE REGIMENTAL SERGEANTMAJOR GOT
AT THEM TOO AFTER THEIR HAIR WAS CUT AND THE MASSED BRIGADE DRUMS
PLAYED IN THE VILLAGE SQUARE OF CARNIRES AND ERE THE END OF THE
MONTH INTERCOMPANY FOOTBALL WAS IN FULL SWING

A DRAFT OF NINETYONE OTHER RANKS JOINED FOR DUTY ON THE 22ND
OCTOBER LIEUTENANTCOLONEL BAGGALLAY MC CAME BACK FROM LEAVE
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THE BRIGADIER ASSUMED COMMAND OF THE
BRIGADE AND CAPTAIN D W GUNSTON JOINED


THE BREAKUP

ON THE LAST DAY OF OCTOBER THEY MOVED FROM CARNIRES TO ST HILAIRE
AND TOOK OVER THE 3RD GRENADIERS BILLETS IN THE FACTORY THERE ALL
OF WHICH HOUSE FOR HOUSE OFFICERS AND MEN WAS PRECISELY AS BEFORE
THE ATTACK ON THE 20TH TEN DAYS AGO BUT THOSE TEN DAYS HAD BORNE
THE BRITISH ARMIES ON THAT FRONT BEYOND VALENCIENNES IN THE NORTH TO
WITHIN GUNSHOT OF LE QUESNOY IN THE CENTRE AND TO THE SAMBRE CANAL
THIRTY MILES AWAY IN THE SOUTH ELSEWHERE LILLE HAD BEEN EVACUATED
THE LOWER HALF OF WESTERN FLANDERS CLEARED FROM THE DUTCH FRONTIER
TO TOURNAI WHILE ALMOST EVERY HOUR BROUGHT UP FROM ONE OR OTHER OF
THE FRENCH AND AMERICAN ARMIES ON THE MEUSE AND THE ARGONNE FRESH
TALLIES OF ABANDONED STORES AND GUNS AND OF PRISONERS GATHERED IN
RATHER THAN CAPTURED BEHIND THIS WELTER MUCH AS THE GLARE OF A MINE
REVEALS THE FAADE OF A FALLING TOWNHALL CAME WORD OF THE COLLAPSE
OF BULGARIA TURKEY AND AUSTRIA THE WHOLE OF THE HERD OF THE HUN
TRIBES WERE ON THE MOVE UNEASY AND AFRAID IT REMAINED SO TO SHATTER
THE MASS OF THEIR RETIRING FORCES IN FRANCE THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN
NO CASE TO CONTINUE ANY SEMBLANCE OF FURTHER WAR WITHOUT COMPLETE
DESTRUCTION WERE THEY PERMITTED TO SLINK OFF UNBROKEN THEY MIGHT
YET MAKE STAND BEHIND SOME SHORTER LINE OR MANUFACTURE A SEMBLANCE
OF A FACE BEFORE THEIR OWN PEOPLE THAT WOULD LATER ENTAIL FRESH
WASTE AND WEARINESS ON THE WORLD9

THE WEATHER AND THE DESTRUCTION THEY HAD LEFT IN THEIR WAKE WAS AS
ON THE SOMME AIDING THEM NOW AT EVERY TURN IN SPITE OF ALL OUR
ROADMEN AND ENGINEERS COULD DO OUR AIRMEN TOOK TOLL OF THEM AND
THEIR BEASTS AS THEY RETREATED ALONG THE CONGESTED WAYS BUT THIS WAS
THE HOUR WHEN THE DELAYS DIVIDED COUNCILS AND SPECIALLY THE STRIKES
OF PAST YEARS HAD TO BE PAID FOR AND THE GIANT BOMBINGPLANES THAT
SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT FEAR AND DECENCY FAR INSIDE THE GERMAN FRONTIERS
WERE NOT READY

A STRAIGHT DRIVE FROM THE WEST ON TO THE GERMAN LATERAL
COMMUNICATIONS PROMISED THE QUICKEST RETURN IT WAS LAID IN THE HANDS
OF THE FIRST THIRD AND FIFTH ARMIES TO SEND THAT ATTACK HOME AND
WITH THE FRENCH AND AMERICAN PRESSURE FROM THE SOUTH BREAK UP THE
MACHINE PAST REPAIR

MEN TODAY SAY AND BELIEVE THAT THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE THE LAST
BATTLE OF THE WAR BUT AT THE TIME OPINIONS VARIED AND THE
EXPECTATIONS OF THE RANK AND FILE WERE MODEST THE THING HAD GONE
ON SO LONG THAT IT SEEMED THE ORDER OF LIFE AND THOUGH THE ENEMY
EVERYWHERE FELL BACK YET HE HAD DONE SO ONCE BEFORE AND OVER
VERY MUCH THE SAME SEMILIQUID MUCK AS WE WERE FLOUNDERING IN THAT
AUTUMNS END THE BETTER THE NEWS THE WORSE THE CHANCE OF A
KNOCK ARGUED THE VETERANS WHILE THE YOUNG HANDS SENT OUT WITH
HIGH ASSURANCE AT DRAFTPARADES THAT THE WAR WAS ON ITS LAST LEGS
DISCOVERED HOW THE MACHINEGUNFENCED REAR OF RETIREMENTS WAS NO
ROUTEMARCH THERE WAS THEM THAT CAME FROM WARLEY SHOUTING YELL
UNDERSTAND AND THERE WAS THEM THAT CAME SAYING NOTHING AT ALL AND
LIKING IT NO MORE THAN THAT BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE OF US
LOOKED TO BE OUT OF IT INSIDE SIX MONTHS NONOT EVEN WHEN WE WAS
DANCING INTO MAUBEUGE WE THOUGHT JERRY WANTED TO GET HIS WIND

ON THE 4TH NOVEMBER ONE WEEK BEFORE THE END TWENTYSIX BRITISH
DIVISIONS MOVED FORWARD ON A THIRTYMILE FRONT FROM OISY TO NORTH OF
VALENCIENNES THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF ALL THEIR ARTILLERY BEHIND THEM

THE GUARDS POSITION HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY SHIFTED INSTEAD OF WORKING
SOUTH OF LE QUESNOY THE DIVISION WAS PUT IN A LITTLE NORTH OF THE
TOWN ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER RHNELLE BETWEEN THE SIXTYSECOND
DIVISION ON THEIR RIGHT AND THE FORTYSECOND ON THEIR LEFT THE
BATTALION HAD MARCHED FROM ST HILAIRE IN THE USUAL SMALL FINE RAIN
ON THE 2ND NOVEMBER TO BILLETS IN BERMERAIN AND BIVOUACS NEAR BY
IT MEANT A TENMILE TRAMP OF THE PREDUCKBOARD ERA IN THE MIDST OF
MIRED HORSE AND LORRYTRANSPORT OVER COUNTRY WHERE THE ENEMY HAD
SMASHED EVERY BRIDGE AND CULVERT BLOCKED ALL ROADS AND PULLINGOUT
PLACES WITH MINECRATERS AND SOWN HOUSES OLD TRENCHES AND DUGOUTS
WITH FANCIFUL DEATHTRAPS THE LAND WAS SMALLFEATURED AND FULL
OF LITTLE HILLS SO HEAVILY HEDGED AND ORCHARDED THAT SPECULATIVE
BATTALIONS COULD BE LOST IN IT IN TWENTY MINUTES THERE WERE COVEYS
TOO OF FRENCH CIVILS RESCUED AND EVACUATED OUT OF THE VILLAGES
AROUND WANDERING AGAINST THE STREAM OF EASTBOUND TRAFFIC THESE
FORLORN LITTLE GROUPS ALL PERSUADED THAT THE WAR WAS OVER AND THAT
THEY COULD RETURN TO THEIR HOUSES TOMORROW HAD TO BE SHIFTED AND
CHAPERONED SOMEHOW THROUGH THE CHAOS BUT THE PATIENCE AND GOODWILL
OF OUR PEOPLE WERE UNENDING

THE WET DAY CLOSED WITH A CONFERENCE AT BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS BUT
THE ENEMY HAD THROWN OUT OUR PLAN FOR ACTION ON THAT SECTOR BY
THOUGHTLESSLY RETIRING ON BOTH FLANKS OF THE DIVISION AS WELL AS A
LITTLE ON THE FRONT OF IT AND FINAL ORDERS WERE NOT FIXED TILL AFTER
MIDNIGHT ON THE 3RD NOVEMBER

THE 1ST AND 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE WERE TO ATTACK THE 3RD IN RESERVE
OF THE 1ST BRIGADE THE 2ND COLDSTREAM WOULD TAKE THE LINE AS FAR AS
THE FIRST OBJECTIVE THE 2ND GRENADIERS WOULD THEN COME THROUGH AND
CARRY ON TO THE NEXT LINE THE IRISH GUARDS IN SUPPORT THE BRIGADES
ASSEMBLY AREA WAS ACROSS THE RHNELLE RIVER EAST OF THE LONG AND
STRAGGLING VILLAGE OF VILLERSPOL ON THE JENLAINLE QUESNOY ROAD
ZERO WAS FIXED FOR 720 THE BATTALION MARCHED FROM BERMERAIN AND
MET ITS FIRST ENEMY SHELL AS IT WAS GOING UNDER THE VALENCIENNES
RAILWAY EMBANKMENT WHAT REMAINED OF THE ROADS WERE BADLY CONGESTED
WITH TROOPS AND ONE GETS THE IDEA THAT THE STAFF WORK WAS CASUAL
TO BEGIN WITH THE BATTALION FOUND THE 3RD GRENADIERS AND THE 1ST
SCOTS GUARDS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHICH WAS NOT
CALCULATED TO SOOTHE ANY CO DESIROUS OF KEEPING HIS APPOINTMENT
APPARENTLY THEY GOT THROUGH THE SCOTS GUARDS BUT WHEN THEY REACHED
THE RHNELLE ITS BRIDGE BEING OF COURSE DESTROYED AND THE RE
WORKING LIKE BEAVERS TO MEND IT THEY HAD TO UNSHIP THEIR LEWISGUNS
FROM THE LIMBERS TELL THE LIMBERS TO COME ON WHEN THE BRIDGE WAS
USABLE AND PASS THE GUNS OVER BY HAND WHILE THUS ENGAGED THE SCOTS
GUARDS CAUGHT THEM UP WENT THROUGH THEM TRIUMPHANTLY MADE EXACTLY
THE SAME DISCOVERY THAT THE IRISH HAD DONE AND WHILE THEY IN TURN
WERE WRESTLING WITH THEIR LIMBERS THE IRISH WHO HAD COMPLETED THEIR
UNSHIPPING WENT THROUGH THEM ONCE MORE AND CROSSED THE RHNELLE
ON THE HEELS OF THE LAST MAN OF THE 3RD GRENADIERSONE AT A TIME
BEING ASSISTED UP THE BANK BY GERMAN PRISONERS BY THE MERCY OF THE
SAINTS WHO MUST HAVE BEEN KEPT BUSY ALL NIGHT THE SHELLING ON THE
BRIDGE AND ITS APPROACHES CEASED WHILE THAT AMAZING PROCESSION GOT
OVER THEY WERE SHELLED AS THEY REFORMED ON THE TOP OF THE STEEP
OPPOSITE BANK BUT BY MARVELLOUS GOODLUCK NO CASUALTIES GOT INTO
ARTILLERY FORMATION WERE SHELLED AGAIN AND THIS TIME HIT AND
LONGRANGE MACHINEGUN FIRE MET THEM OVER THE NEXT CREST OF GROUND
IT WAS ALL IDEAL MACHINEGUN LANDSCAPE THE 2ND GRENADIERS WHOM
THEY WERE SUPPORTING HAD BEEN HELD UP BY LOW FIRE FROM THE VILLAGE
OF WAGNIESLEPETIT ON THEIR LEFT A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST
OBJECTIVE WHICH WAS THE ROAD RUNNING FROM WAGNIES SOUTH TO FRASNOY
THE BATTALION DUG IN BEHIND THEM WHERE IT WAS AND AFTER AN HOUR
OR SO THE ENEMY OPENED FIRE WITH ONE SOLITARY MAD TRENCHMORTAR
NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN ROUNDS WERE SENT OVER AND THESE VERY
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE WEAPON HAPPENED TO LIE UNDER THEIR HANDS AND
WAS USED BEFORE BEING ABANDONED AND LUCK HAD IT THAT THIS CHANCE
DEMONSTRATION SHOULD KILL LIEUTENANT A L BAIN ANDY BAIN WHO
HAD JOINED FOR DUTY NOT A WEEK AGO HE WAS THE LAST OFFICER KILLED IN
THE BATTALION AND ONE OF THE BEST LIEUTENANT F S L SMITH MC
ALSO WAS WOUNDED THEY STAYED IN THEIR SCRATCHHOLES TILL LATE IN
THE AFTERNOON AS THE TROOPS OF THE FORTYSECOND DIVISION ON THEIR
LEFT WERE HELD UP TOO BUT THE 2ND GUARDS BRIGADE ON THEIR RIGHT
GRADUALLY WORKED FORWARD SOME OF THEIR DIVISIONAL FIELDGUNS CAME
UP AND SHELLED WAGNIESLEPETIT INTO SILENCE AND AT HALFPAST FOUR
ORDERS ARRIVED FOR THE BATTALION TO GO THROUGH THE 2ND GRENADIERS
AND CONTINUE AT LARGE INTO THE DUSK THAT WAS CLOSING ON THE BLIND
HEDGESCREENED COUNTRY THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR OPPOSITION BEYOND
STRAY SHELLS BUT THE BOGGYBANKED AUNELLE HAD TO BE CROSSED ON
STRETCHERS THROUGH THICK UNDERGROWTH IN A STEEP VALLEY EVERYTHING
AFTER THAT SEEMED TO BE ORCHARDS HIGH HEDGES AND SUNK AND RAISED
ROADS VARIED WITH SOFT BITS OF CULTIVATION OR HOPELESSLY MUDDLEDUP
CULDESACS OF FARMTRACKS THE COMPANIES PLAYED BLINDMANS BUFF
AMONG THESE OBSTACLES IN THE PITCHDARK AS THEY HUNTED ALTERNATELY
FOR EACH OTHER AND THE TROOPS ON THEIR FLANKS THERE WAS VERY
HEAVY SHELLING ON THE THREE MOST ADVANCED COMPANIES AS WELL AS ON
BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE MEN DUG IN WHERE THEY
WERE AND CASUALTIES ALL TOLD CAME TO ABOUT TWENTY VERY EARLY
ON THE 5TH NOVEMBER THE 3RD GUARDS BRIGADE PASSED THROUGH THEM AND
CONTINUED THE ADVANCE PREUXAUSART THE VILLAGE BEHIND THEM HAD
BEEN TAKEN BY THE 2ND BRIGADE THE EVENING AND THE NIGHT BEFORE SO
THE BATTALION CAME OUT OF ITS SLITS AND WENT BACK TO BILLET IN ITS
RELIEVED AND REJOICING STREETS WHERE THE INHABITANTS ON COMING OUT
OF THEIR CELLARS IN THE MORNING WERE DELIGHTED TO FIND BRITISH TROOPS
AGAIN AND SHOWED THE GREATEST CORDIALITY IF RUMOUR BE TRUE THEY
ALSO SHOWED THEM HOW EASILY THEIR HUN CONQUERORS HAD BEEN MISLED
AND HOODWINKED IN THE MATTER OF GOOD VINTAGES BURIED AND SET ASIDE
AGAINST THIS VERY DAY THE MEN WERE VERY COMFORTABLE

THE FACT THAT AUSTRIA WAS REPORTED OUT OF THE WAR DID NOT MAKE THE
NEXT DAY ANY LESS PLEASANT EVEN THOUGH IT RAINED AND ALL THE
WINDOWS IN THE BATTALION HEADQUARTERS WERE BROKEN BY ONE SHELL
BATTALION HEADQUARTERS HAD COME THROUGH WORSE THAN BROKEN GLASS IN
ITS TIME BUT WAS NOW BEGINNING TO GROW FASTIDIOUS

ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 7TH NOVEMBER THE BATTALION MARCHED TO BAVAI
OVER MUDDY ROADS IN A DRIZZLE EVEN THEN MEN HAVE SAID THERE
WAS NO GENERAL BELIEF IN THE END OF ARMAGEDDON THEY LOOKED FOR
A LULL PERHAPS VERY POSSIBLY SOME SORT OF CONFERENCE AND WASTE
OF TIME WHICH WOULD GIVE THE ENEMY BREATH FOR FRESH ENTERPRISE
A FEW HOWEVER INSIST THAT THE CAREFUL DESTRUCTION OF THE ROADS
AND RAILWAYBRIDGES AND THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PRISONERS AS THEY
POURED IN WARNED THEM OF THE REAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IT LOOKED AS
IF THE JERRIES HAD DONE ALL THE HARM THEY COULD THINK OF AND WERE
CHUCKING ITLIKE BOYS CAUGHT ROBBING AN ORCHARD THERE WASNT AN
ATOM OF DIGNITY OR DECENCY ABOUT ANY OF EM JUST DIRT AND EXHAUSTED
JERRYDOM WHAT THE BATTALION FELT MOST WAS HAVING TO MAKE DETOURS
ROUND BROKEN BRIDGES AND TO DIG RAMPS IN MINECRATERS ON THE ROADS
TO GET THEIR LEWISGUNS ACROSS THEY JETTISONED THEIR SECONDLINE
TRANSPORT AT A CONVENIENT CHTEAU OUTSIDE BAVAI ON THIS ACCOUNT
FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO ARRANGEMENTS FOR BILLETING IN THE TOWN SO
MADE THEIR OWN AND WHILE BAVAI WAS BEING SHELLED GOT INTO HOUSES
AND AGAIN WERE VERY COMFORTABLE THE 2ND BRIGADE WERE IN THE FRONT
LINE ON THE RAILWAY AND NEXT DAY THE 1ST BRIGADE WERE TO LEAD AND
CAPTURE MAUBEUGE SEVEN MILES DOWN A ROAD WHICH CUT ACROSS THE LINE
OF THEIR EARLIER STAGES IN THE RETREAT FROM MONS AND THREE MILES AS
A SHELL RANGES FROM THE VILLAGE OF MALPLAQUET

THEY BEGAN THEIR LAST DAY HALF AN HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT MARCHING
AS A BATTALION OUT OF BAVAI WITH THEIR LEWISGUN LIMBERS TWICE
THEY WERE SLIGHTLY SHELLED ONCE AT LEAST THEY HAD TO UNPACK AND
NEGOTIATE MORE MINECRATERS AT CROSSROADS IT WAS A POPULOUS WORLD
THROUGH WHICH THEY TRAMPED AND ALL SILENTLY BUT TENSELY AWAKEA
WORLD MADE UP OF A STRAIGHT HARD ROAD HUMPED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE
FIELDS IN PLACES RATHER LIKE THE MENIN ROAD WHEN IT WAS YOUNG BUT
WITH UNTOUCHED TILED HOUSES ALONGSIDE HERE AND THERE ONE HEARD THE
CHATTER OF A MACHINEGUN AS DETACHED AND IRRELEVANT AS THE LAUGH
OF AN IDIOT IT WOULD CEASE AND A SINGLE FIELDGUN WOULD OPEN AS
ON SOME PRIVATE QUARREL THEN SILENCE AND A SUSPICION BORN OUT OF
THE DARKNESS THAT THE ROAD WAS MINED NEXT ORDERS TO THE COMPANIES
TO SPREAD THEMSELVES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN THE DARK TO LINE
DITCHES AND THE LIKE FOR FEAR OF ATTACK THEN AN OVERTAKING AT
WRECKED CROSSROADS OF SOME OF THE 2ND BRIGADE WHO REPORTED PATROLS
OF THE 3RD GRENADIERS HAD PUSHED ON INTO MAUBEUGE WITHOUT OPPOSITION
AND THAT THE REST OF THAT BATTALION WAS GONE ON JUST BEFORE DAWN
NO 4 COMPANY OF THE IRISH MARCHING ON A ROAD PARALLEL TO THE
HIGHWAY RAN INTO A COMPANY OF GERMANS RETIRING THE DIARY SAYS A
SHORT SHARP FIGHT ENSUED IN WHICH FIVE OF THE ENEMY WERE WOUNDED
AND TWELVE CAPTURED THE REST GETTING OFF IN THE DARK BUT THERE
IS A LEGEND IT MAY HAVE GROWN WITH THE YEARS THAT THE TWO BODIES
FOUND THEMSELVES SUDDENLY ALMOST SIDE BY SIDE ON CONVERGING TRACKS
AND THAT THE IRISH NO WORD GIVEN THREW BACK TO THE INSTINCTS OF
FONTENOYFACED ABOUT FRONTRANK KNEELING REARRANK STANDING AND
IN THIS POSTURE DESTROYED ALL THAT COMPANY IT WAS A THING THAT MIGHT
WELL HAVE COME ABOUT DARKLING IN A LAND SCATTERED WITH ODDS AND
ENDS OF DRIFTING CRAZED HUMANITY NO 2 COMPANY SOLEMNLY REPORTED
THE CAPTURE OF TWO WHOLE PRISONERS JUST AFTER THEY HAD CROSSED THE
RAILWAY IN THE SUBURBS OF MAUBEUGE WHICH THEY PASSED THROUGH ON THE
MORNING OF THE 9TH AND BY NOON WERE DULY ESTABLISHED AND POSTED
COMPANY BY COMPANY WELL TO THE EAST OF IT NO 2 COMPANY LAY IN
THE VILLAGE OF ASSEVANT WITH PICKETS ON THE BROKEN BRIDGE OVER THE
RIVER THERE AN OBSERVATIONLINE BY DAY AND ALL PROPER SUPPORTS NO
4 COMPANY IN POSTS ON THE ROAD AND DOWN TO THE RIVER AND NOS 1 AND
3 IN RESERVE YEOMANRY AND CORPS CYCLISTS OUT IN FRONT AS THOUGH THE
WAR WERE ETERNAL


AFTER THE ARMISTICE

AND THUS DISPERSED AFTER A LITTLE SHELLING OF ASSEVANT DURING THE
NIGHT THE IRISH GUARDS RECEIVED WORD THAT AN ARMISTICE WAS DECLARED
AT 11 A M THIS MORNING NOVEMBER 11

MEN TOOK THE NEWS ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURES INDURATED PESSIMISTS
AFTER PROVING THAT IT WAS A LIE SAID IT WOULD BE BUT AN INTERLUDE
OTHERS RETIRED INTO THEMSELVES AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN SHOT OR WENT
STIFFLY OFF ABOUT THE METICULOUS EXECUTION OF SOME TRUMPERY DETAIL
OF KITCLEANING SOME TURNED ROUND AND FELL ASLEEP THEN AND THERE
AND A FEW LOST ALL HOLDS FOR A WHILE IT WAS THE APPALLING NEW
SILENCE OF THINGS THAT SOOTHED AND UNSETTLED THEM IN TURN THEY DID
NOT REALIZE TILL ALL SOUNDS OF THEIR TRADE CEASED AND THE STILLNESS
STUNG IN THEIR EARS AS SODAWATER STINGS ON THE PALATE HOW ENTIRELY
THESE HAD BEEN PART OF THEIR STRAINED BODIES AND SOULS IT FELT
LIKE FALLING THROUGH INTO NOTHING YELL UNDERSTAND LISTENING FOR
WHAT WASNT THERE AND TRYIN NOT TO SHOUT WHEN YOU REMEMBERED FOR
WHY MEN COMING UP FROM DETAILS CAMP ACROSS OLD UNWHOLESOME
AREAS HEARD NOTHING BUT THE ROAR OF THE LORRIES ON WHICH THEY HAD
STOLEN THEIR LIFT AND REJOICED WITH A CHILDISH MIXTURE OF FEAR AS
THEY TOPPED EVERY UNSCREENED RISE THAT WAS NOW MERE SCENERY SUCH
AS TOURISTS WOULD USE LATER TO RAISE THE HEAD WITHOUT THOUGHT OF
PRECAUTION AGAINST WHAT MIGHT BE IN FRONT OR ON EITHER FLANK INTO
FREE STILL AIR WAS THE FIRST PLEASURE OF THAT GREAT RELEASE TO LIE
DOWN THAT NIGHT IN A BIG BARN BESIDE UNSCREENED BRAZIERS WITH ONES
SMILING COMPANIONS WHO TALKED TILL SLEEP OVERTOOK THEM AND WHEN
THE LAST HAPPY BABBLER HAD DROPPED OFF TO HEAR THE LONGFORGOTTEN
SOUND OF A HORSES FEET TROTTING EVENLY ON A HARD ROAD UNDER A FULL
MOON CROWNED ALL THAT HAD GONE BEFORE EACH MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT
IN THOSE MIRACULOUS FIRST HOURS IEVEN I MYSELF HEREHAVE COME
THROUGH THE WAR TO SCORN THE SHELTER OF SUNKEN ROADS HEDGES WALLS
OR LINES OF TREES AND TO EXTEND IN UNMARTIAL CROWDS ACROSS THE WHOLE
WIDTH OF A PAV WERE EXERCISES IN FREEDOM THAT HE ARRIVED AT LATER
WE CANNOT REALIZE IT AT ALL  SO MAD WITH JOY WE DONT FEEL YET
WHAT IT ALL MEANS THE HOME LETTERS WERE ALL IN THIS STRAIN

THE BATTALION WAS RELIEVED ON THE 12TH NOVEMBER BY THE 2ND GRENADIERS
AND BILLETED IN THE FAUBOURG DE MONS ALL MAUBEUGE WAS HYSTERICAL
WITH ITS EMOTIONS OF RELEASE AND WELL PROVIDED WITH WINES WHICH
HERE AS ELSEWHERE HAD SOMEHOW MISSED THE GERMAN NOSE THE CITY
LIVED IN HER STREETS AND KISSED EVERYBODY IN KHAKI THAT NONE SHOULD
COMPLAIN BUT THE BATTALION WAS NOT IN WALKINGOUT ORDER AND SO HAD
TO BE INSPECTED RIGOROUSLY MORNINGDRILL OUTSIDE BILLETS NEXT DAY
WAS IN THE NATURE OF A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONTO THE SCANDAL OF THE
GRAVE SERGEANTS

ON THE 14TH A GREAT THANKSGIVINGSERVICE WAS HELD IN THE CATHEDRAL
FOR ALL THE WORLD THE BATTALION PROVIDING THE GUARD OF HONOUR AT THE
ALTAR AND LINING THE PLACE DARMES AT THE PRESENTATION OF A FLAG
BY THE MAYOR OF MAUBEUGE TO THE MAJORGENERAL THE MASSED DRUMS OF
THE DIVISION PLAYED IN THE SQUARE IN THE AFTERNOON AN EVENT TO BE
REMEMBERED AS LONG AS THE BATTALION DINNER OF THE EVENING THEY WERE
ALL ROUTEMARCHED NEXT MORNING FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF TO STEADY THEM
AND ON THE 16TH AFTER DINNER SET OFF IN FREEZING WEATHER FOR THE
FIRST STAGE OF THEIR JOURNEY TO COLOGNE IT RAN VIA BETTIGNIES AND
THEN TO VILLERSSIRENICOLE A MATTER OF FIVE AND A HALF MILES

ON THE 17TH THEY CROSSED THE BELGIAN FRONTIER AT GIVET AND REACHED
BINCHE THROUGH A COUNTRYSIDE ALREADY CROWDED WITH RETURNING ENGLISH
FRENCH ITALIAN AND BELGIAN PRISONERS ONE DIARY NOTES THEM LIKE
MIGRATING BIRDS ALL HOPPING ALONG THE ROAD GOING DUE WEST BINCHE
MOBBED THE DRUMS AS ONE MAN AND WOMAN WHEN THEY PLAYED IN THE TOWN
AT RETREAT BUT IT WAS WORSE AT CHARLEROI ON THE 19TH WHERE THEY
COULD HARDLY FORCE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WELCOMING CROWDS THE PLACE
WAS LIT FROM END TO END AND THE WHOLE POPULACE SHOUTED FOR JOY AT
DELIVERANCE

NOW THAT THEY HAD RETURNED AS A BODY TO CIVILIZATION IT WAS NEEDFUL
THEY SHOULD BE DRESSED AND THEY WERE PARADED FOR AN IMPORTANT
INSPECTION OF GREATCOATS AND ABOVE ALL GLOVES THAT LAST AND THE
FACT THAT BELTS WHEN WALKING OUT WERE WORN OVER THE GREATCOATS
WERE SURE SIGNS THAT WAR WAS DONE AND HIS MAJESTYS FOOT GUARDS
HAD COME INTO THEIR OWN BUT THEY FOUND TIME AT CHARLEROI AMONG
MORE PLEASANT DUTIES TO ARREST THREE GERMAN SOLDIERS DISGUISED AS
CIVILIANS

ON THE 23RD THEY LEFT FOR SARTSTLAURENT WHOSE MAYOR BENEATH A
VAST BELGIAN FLAG MET AND ESCORTED THEM INTO THE TOWN THE COUNTRY
CHANGED AS THEY MOVED ON FROM FLAT COALDISTRICTS TO UNTOUCHED HILLS
AND WOODS ON THE 24TH THEY PICKED UP A DUMP OF EIGHTYFOUR GUNS OF
ALL CALIBRES HANDED OVER ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE ARMISTICE
PASSED THROUGH A TRACT OF HEAVILY WIRED COUNTRY WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY
INTENDED FOR THE MEUSE LINE THAT THE GERMANS WERE TO HAVE FALLEN BACK
ON AND A LITTLE LATER CROSSED BEING THE FIRST OF THE DIVISION TO
DO SO THE STEEPLY BANKED SWIFTLY RUNNING MEUSE BY A PONTOON BRIDGE
NEXT THEIR ROAD CLIMBED INTO NANINE ONE OF THE LOVELIEST VILLAGES
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD EVER SEEN BUT THEIR HEARTS WERE SOFT IN THOSE
DAYS AND ALL THAT WORLD OF PEACE SEEMED GOOD THEY DARED NOT HALT
AT SORINNELALONGUE THE NEXT DAY AS THE PLACE WAS INFECTED WITH
INFLUENZA SPANISH FEVER SO PUSHED ON TO LESVES AND ON THE 26TH
NOVEMBER TO SORE WHERE WAS ANOTHER WAYSIDE DUMP OF THIRTY OR FORTY
HUN GUNS IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THE DISCARDED TOOLS OF THEIR TRADE
FRANKLY BORED THEM WHERE A HUN UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE
RETRIUMPHED AND CALLED ON HIS SERVILE GODS THESE ISLANDERS OF
WHOM ALMOST A HALF WERE NOW ENGLISH WERE AFFLICTED WITH A CURIOUS
RESTLESSNESS AND STRONG DESIRE TO GET DONE WITH THE WORK IN HAND ALL
THEIR WORLD WAS UNDER THE SAME REACTION THEY HAD TO WAIT AT SORE
FOR THREE DAYS AS SUPPLIES WERE COMING UP BADLY INDEED ON THE
28TH NOVEMBER THE DIARY NOTES BITTERLY THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
THE WAR THE SUPPLIES FAILED TO ARRIVE THE QUARTERMASTER MANAGED TO
IMPROVISE BREAKFASTS FOR THE BATTALION IT WAS NOT ALL THE FAULT OF
BAD ROADS OR THE DISPERSION OF THE TROOPS THE INSTANT THE STRAIN WAS
TAKEN OFF THERE WAS A PERCEPTIBLE SLACKENING EVERYWHERE MOST MARKED
IN THE BACKAREAS ON THE CLERICAL AND FORWARDING SIDES EVERY ONE
WANTED TO GET HOME AT ONCE AND WORKED WITH BUT HALF A MIND WHICH
ALSO IS HUMAN NATURE

THEY WERE ON THE ROAD AGAIN BY DECEMBER 5 WITH THE REST OF THEIR
BRIGADE AND REACHED MAN IN THE AFTERNOON OVER MUDDY ROADS BY THE
6TH THEY WERE AT VILLERSSTGERTRUDE HILLMARCHING THROUGH BEAUTIFUL
SCENERY WHICH DID NOT AMUSE THEM BECAUSE OWING TO THE STATE OF
COMMUNICATIONS SUPPLIES WERE DELAYED AGAIN SO ON THE 8TH DECEMBER
AT LIERNEUX FIFTEEN MILES FROM VILLERSSTGERTRUDE ANOTHER HALT
WAS CALLED FOR ANOTHER THREE DAYS WHILE COMPANY OFFICERS HOMESICK
AS THEIR MEN DRILLED THEM IN THE WINTER DIRT ON THE 11TH THEY
CROSSED THE GERMAN FRONTIER LINE AT RECHT AND THE DRUMS PLAYED THE
BATTALION OVER TO THE REGIMENTAL MARCH BUT YELL UNDERSTAND
WE WAS ALL WET THE MOST OF THAT TIME AND FIGHTING WITH THE MUD
AN OUR BOOTS TWAS JERRYS OWN WEATHER THE MINUTE WE SET FOOT IN
HIS COUNTRY AND WE NONE OF US FELT LIKE CONQUERORS WE WAS JUST
DHRIPPIN MICKS AT VIELSALM ALMOST THE LAST VILLAGE OUTSIDE
GERMANY THEY PICKED UP A DRAFT OF SIXTY MEN TO SHARE WITH THEM THE
HORRORS OF PEACE AHEAD AND A SUPPLYSYSTEM GONE TO BITS BEHIND THEM

THEIR ROAD WOUND THROUGH SMALL AND INCONSPICUOUS HAMLETS AMONG WOODED
HILLS BY STRETCHES OF SIX OR SEVEN HOURS MARCHING A DAY THE PEOPLE
THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH SEEMED MEEK AND VISIBLY OPPRESSED WITH THE FEAR
OF ROUGH TREATMENT THAT REMOVED FROM THEIR MINDS THEY STEPPED ASIDE
AND LOOKED WONDERINGLY AT THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE ENEMY THAT TRAMPED
THROUGH THEIR STREETS LEAVING NEITHER RUIN NOR RAPE BEHIND BY THE
18TH DECEMBER THE ADVANCE HAD REACHED LOVENICH AND AFTER TWO DAYS
REST THERE THEY ENTERED COLOGNE ON THE 23RD DECEMBER WITH AN ABSENCE
OF DISPLAY THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE
NATIVES THEY HAD COVERED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES OVER BAD ROADS
IN BAD BOOTS THAT COULD NOT BE REPAIRED NOR THROWN AWAY AND BUT ONE
MAN HAD FALLEN OUT THE DRUMS PLAYED BRIAN BORU WHEN THEY ENTERED
THE HOHENZOLLERN RING THEIR MAJORGENERAL BEHELD THAT LAST MARCH
AND THEY WERE DULY PHOTOGRAPHED IN THE WET WHILE THE WORLD THAT
SAW SUCH PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE WEEKLY ILLUSTRATED PAPERS WAS HONESTLY
CONVINCED THAT THE GREAT WAR AND ALL WAR WAS AT AN END FOR EVERMORE

THEN REALLY SERIOUS TROUBLE OVERTOOK THEM WHICH WAS IN SOME SORT
A FORECAST OF THE DAYS TO COME THEIR BILLETS AT NIPPES IN THE
SUBURBS OF COLOGNE WERE EXCELLENT AND CLEAN THOUGH OF COURSE
IN NEED OF THE USUAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH EVERY BATTALION OF THE
BRIGADE IS BOUND TO MAKE BUT ON CHRISTMAS DAY OWING TO TRANSPORT
DIFFICULTIES THE MENS CHRISTMAS DINNER DID NOT ARRIVE THIS THING
HAD NEVER HAPPENED IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE WAR PRESSURE OF WORK
IN THE FRONT LINE HAD DELAYED THAT DINNER AS ON THE SOMME ENEMY
ATTENTIONS HAD CAUSED IT TO BE EATEN IN HASTE A SORT OF PASSOVER
AS IN THE DREAD SALIENT BUT COMPLETE BREAKDOWN WAS UNHEARD OF
THE BATTALION RIGHTLY HELD IT MORTAL SIN AND SPOKE THEIR MINDS
ABOUT THE TRANSPORT WHICH WAS FIGHTING MUD AND DISTANCE ACROSS
THE HILLS AS LOYALLY AS EVER IT WAS THE BACKAREAS THAT HAD BEEN
CAUGHT UNPREPARED BY THE PEACE BUT ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT SUPERB AND
UNSCRUPULOUS STAFFWORK WENT TO SECURE IT A FAITHFUL LORRY PLOUGHED
IN FROM PARIS WITH WHAT WAS WANTED AND ON BOXING DAY THE FULL AND
COMPLETE CHRISTMAS DINNER WAS SERVED AND FOR THE FIFTH AND LAST TIME
THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER PERFORMED THE SACRED RITUAL OF GOING ROUND
THE DINNERS

THEY SAT THEM DOWN TWENTYTWO OFFICERS AND SIX HUNDRED AND
TWENTYEIGHT OTHER RANKS AND NONE WILL KNOW TILL JUDGMENT DAY HOW
MANY GHOSTS WERE ALSO PRESENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE AUGUST
14 THE MONTHLY RETURNS SHOWED NO OFFICER OR MAN KILLED WOUNDED
OR MISSING THE TWO BATTALIONS HAD LOST IN ALL TWO THOUSAND THREE
HUNDRED AND FORTYNINE DEAD INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN
OFFICERS THEIR TOTAL OF WOUNDED WAS FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND
THIRTYNINE OF BOTH THESE THE 1ST BATTALION BY VIRTUE OF THIRTEEN
MONTHS LONGER IN THE FIELD COULD RECKON MORE THAN A GENEROUS HALF

THEY WERE TOO NEAR AND TOO DEEPLY STEEPED IN THE WAR THAT YEARS END
TO REALIZE THEIR LOSSES THEIR EARLY DEAD AS MEN TALKED OVER THE
PAST IN COLOGNE SEEMED TO BELONG TO IMMENSELY REMOTE AGES EVEN
THOSE OF THAT VERY SPRING OF WHOM FRIENDS COULD STILL SAY IF
SOANDSO HAD ONLY LIVED TO SEE THIS STOOD AS FAR REMOVED AS THE
SHADOWY GREAT ONES OF THE PREBOMB PREDUCKBOARD TWILIGHT AND IN
SOME INEXPRESSIBLE FASHION THEY THEMSELVES APPEARED TO THEMSELVES
THE ONLY LIVING PEOPLE IN AN UNCARING WORLD YET COLOGNE WAS ALIVE
WITH SOLDIERY ROADS WERE ROARING FULL AS COMMUNICATIONS WERE
RESTORED MEN STOOD GUARD OVER VISIBLE GUN AND AMMUNITIONDUMPS
THE BATTALION JOINED IN MARCHES TO THE BRIDGEHEADS ATTENDED
FOOTBALL MATCHES SAW HOSTS OF NEW FACES BELONGING TO NEW TROOPS OF
ALL BREEDS AND WATCHED ABOUT THEM IN THE WET GREY WEATHER THE
MUDDYFACED HUNFOLK METHODICALLY AS USUAL TRYING TO FIND OUT JUST
HOW FAR IT WAS EXPEDIENT TO GO WITH THE HERALDS OF THE ALLEGED NEW
ORDER

BUT YELL UNDERSTAND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SAID AND DONE THERE
WAS NOTHING REAL TO IT AT ALL EXCEPT WHEN WE GOT TO TALKING AND
PASSING ROUND THE NAMES OF THEM WE WISHED WAS WITH US WE WAS LONELY
IN THOSE DAYS THE HALF OF US WAS CHURCH OF ENGLAND BY THEN TOO BUT
WE WERE LONELY YELL UNDERSTAND AS UNITS AND OUR BILLETS MIND YE
MAAGNIFICENT WITH WALLS AND LOCKERS AND DOORS AND ALL THE SAME FOR
THE OFFICERS AND THERE WAS MR  THAT ID KNOWN WELL ANY TIME
THESE LAST TWO WINTERS FREEZING AND SWEARING ALONGSIDE OF ME IN ANY
SHELLHOLE WE COULD FIND AND GLAD TO BE OUT OF THE WINDAND NOW
HIM CURSIN IN HIS QUARTERS BECAUSE HE HAD NOT THE JERRYTALK FOR THE
GERMAN FOR TURN OFF THAT DAM STEAMHEAT AND THATS WAR ALSO

BUT YE MIGHT TELL THAT WE WAS LONELY MOST OF ALL BEFORE GOD WE
MICKS WAS LONELY

FOOTNOTES

1 ABOUT THIS TIME ON A DISTANT FLANK OF THE WAR THERE WAS A VERY
YOUNG FRENCH LIEUTENANT OF ARTILLERY WHO IN HIS FIRST ACTION WHEN
EVENING CAME TELEPHONED TO HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER AS TO DISPOSITIONS
FOR THE NIGHT IN THE SINCERE BELIEF THAT FOLLOWING THE CUSTOM OF
ALL WARS UP TO DATE THE GUNS WOULD STOP AS THE DARKNESS CLOSED HIS
ANSWER WAS THIS WILL BE A WAR IN WHICH NO ONE EVER GOES TO BED

2   AND THE NEXT TIME I SAW ZILLEBEKE IT WAS A DESERTED RUIN
AND THE SMALL HOUSE WHOSE INMATES HAD BEEN SO KIND TO MY SUBALTERNS
AND ME WAS A HEAP OF DEBRISEXTRACT FROM A COMPANY COMMANDERS
DIARY

3 AT THE CROSSROADS NEAR KLEIN ZILLEBEKE WE HALTED LYING DOWN
ON EACH SIDE THE ROAD AS SHELLS WERE COMING OVER IN THE CENTRE OF
THE ROAD LAY A DEAD TROOPER OF SOME BRITISH CAVALRY REGIMENT HIS
HORSE ALSO HALF DEAD ACROSS HIM A WOMAN PASSED BY SHE HAD ALL
HER HOUSEHOLD TREASURES STRAPPED ON HER BACK AND HELD THE HANDS OF
TWO VERY SMALL CHILDREN SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF ANY ONE BUT I SAW THE
TWO LITTLE CHILDREN SHY AWAY FROM THE DEAD MANDIARY OF A COMPANY
OFFICER

4 THEIR BRIGADIER LORD CAVAN WROTE ON THE 20TH NOVEMBER TO
CAPTAIN N ORREWING COMMANDING THE BATTALION I WANT YOU TO CONVEY
TO EVERY MAN IN YOUR BATTALION THAT I CONSIDER THAT THE SAFETY OF
THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE BRITISH SECTION DEPENDED ENTIRELY UPON THEIR
STAUNCHNESS AFTER THE DISASTROUS DAY NOV 1 THOSE OF THEM THAT WERE
LEFT MADE HISTORY AND I CAN NEVER THANK THEM ENOUGH FOR THE WAY IN
WHICH THEY RECOVERED THEMSELVES AND SHOWED THE ENEMY THAT THE IRISH
GUARDS MUST BE RECKONED WITH HOWEVER HARD HIT

5 BRIGADE RESERVE MEANS IN READINESS TO MOVE AT SHORT NOTICE IN
ANY DIRECTION TO SUPPORT ALL WAGONS STANDING PACKED DAY AND NIGHT
EXCEPT THAT THE BLANKETS MAY BE USED BY THE MEN CORPS RESERVE TAKES
A BATTALION DEFINITELY OUT OF THE LINE FOR THE TIME BEING AND OUT OF
REACH OF ALL EXCEPT AIRBOMBING

6 I SAW HIM SLIP BACK OVER THE PARAPET IN THE MORNIN MIST THE
WAY HE ALWAYS DID JUST BEHIND THE OFFICER GOING THE ROUNDS AN HIS
POCKETS WAS BULGIN I HAD BEEN LAYIN FOR HIM A LONG WHILE BECAUSE
I KNEW HE HAD SOMETHING I WANTED SO I WENT UP BEHIND HIM AND I SAID
QUITE QUIET C ILL TAKE YOUR NIGHTS PICKINS IF ITS THE SAME
TO YOU HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE AN TO DO HIM JUSTICE HE BORE IT WELL
WELL ANYWAY SERGEANT SAYS HE TIS WORTH FIVE FRANCS TO YOU IS
IT NOT YES SAYS I AND I GAVE HIM THE FIVE FRANCS THEN AN THERE
AN HE EMPTIED HIS POCKETS INTO MY HANDS TWAS WORTH ALL OF FIVE
FRANCS TO ME CS WORK THAT NIGHT AN HE NEVER BORE ME MALICE
THEREAFTERA SERGEANTS TALE

7 HE WAS SUCCEEDED BY MAJORGENERAL FEILDING IN COMMAND OF THE
GUARDS DIVISION BRIGADIERGENERAL PEREIRA COMMANDING THE 1ST GUARDS
BRIGADE

8 THESE WERE VAST CELLARS REACHED BY A HUNDRED STEPS AND AT THE
BOTTOM OF THEM RESIDED A VERY OLD SOLDIER WHO DID LITTLE MORE THAN
BOIL THE HOT WATER FOR THE OFFICERS BATHS AND LOOK AFTER A CERTAIN
MASCOTGOAT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM BY A FRENCH CORPS WHEN THE
ORDER TO MOVE AT ONCE CAME THE PARTING WORDS OF THE OFFICER IN
CHARGE OF THE GOAT TO THE AGED MAN WERE NOW YOU LOOK AFTER THE GOAT
AND OUR BLANKETS AND DONT WALK ABOUT UPSTAIRS YOU NEEDNT
WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF IF YOURE TAKEN PRISONER WELL SEND YOU LOTS OF
PARCELS LOOK AFTER THE GOAT AND HANG ON TO OUR BLANKETS HE DID

9 THIS BE IT REMEMBERED GIVES ROUGHLY THE IDEA AT THE CLOSE OF
1918
