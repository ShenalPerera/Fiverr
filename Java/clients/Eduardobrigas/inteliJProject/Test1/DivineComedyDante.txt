THE DIVINE COMEDY
THE VISION OF HELL PURGATORY AND PARADISE

BY

DANTE ALIGHIERI


PARADISE

CANTO I

HIS GLORY BY WHOSE MIGHT ALL THINGS ARE MOVD
PIERCES THE UNIVERSE AND IN ONE PART
SHEDS MORE RESPLENDENCE ELSEWHERE LESS  IN HEAVN
THAT LARGELIEST OF HIS LIGHT PARTAKES WAS I
WITNESS OF THINGS WHICH TO RELATE AGAIN
SURPASSETH POWER OF HIM WHO COMES FROM THENCE
FOR THAT SO NEAR APPROACHING ITS DESIRE
OUR INTELLECT IS TO SUCH DEPTH ABSORBD
THAT MEMORY CANNOT FOLLOW  NATHLESS ALL
THAT IN MY THOUGHTS I OF THAT SACRED REALM
COULD STORE SHALL NOW BE MATTER OF MY SONG

BENIGN APOLLO THIS LAST LABOUR AID
AND MAKE ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY WORTH
AS THY OWN LAUREL CLAIMS OF ME BELOVD
THUS FAR HATH ONE OF STEEP PARNASSUS BROWS
SUFFICD ME HENCEFORTH THERE IS NEED OF BOTH
FOR MY REMAINING ENTERPRISE DO THOU
ENTER INTO MY BOSOM AND THERE BREATHE
SO AS WHEN MARSYAS BY THY HAND WAS DRAGGD
FORTH FROM HIS LIMBS UNSHEATHD  O POWER DIVINE
IF THOU TO ME OF SHINE IMPART SO MUCH
THAT OF THAT HAPPY REALM THE SHADOWD FORM
TRACD IN MY THOUGHTS I MAY SET FORTH TO VIEW
THOU SHALT BEHOLD ME OF THY FAVOURD TREE
COME TO THE FOOT AND CROWN MYSELF WITH LEAVES
FOR TO THAT HONOUR THOU AND MY HIGH THEME
WILL FIT ME  IF BUT SELDOM MIGHTY SIRE
TO GRACE HIS TRIUMPH GATHERS THENCE A WREATH
CAESAR OR BARD MORE SHAME FOR HUMAN WILLS
DEPRAVD JOY TO THE DELPHIC GOD MUST SPRING
FROM THE PIERIAN FOLIAGE WHEN ONE BREAST
IS WITH SUCH THIRST INSPIRD  FROM A SMALL SPARK
GREAT FLAME HATH RISEN AFTER ME PERCHANCE
OTHERS WITH BETTER VOICE MAY PRAY AND GAIN
FROM THE CIRRHAEAN CITY ANSWER KIND

THROUGH DIVER PASSAGES THE WORLDS BRIGHT LAMP
RISES TO MORTALS BUT THROUGH THAT WHICH JOINS
FOUR CIRCLES WITH THE THREEFOLD CROSS IN BEST
COURSE AND IN HAPPIEST CONSTELLATION SET
HE COMES AND TO THE WORLDLY WAX BEST GIVES
ITS TEMPER AND IMPRESSION  MORNING THERE
HERE EVE WAS BY ALMOST SUCH PASSAGE MADE
AND WHITENESS HAD OERSPREAD THAT HEMISPHERE
BLACKNESS THE OTHER PART WHEN TO THE LEFT
I SAW BEATRICE TURND AND ON THE SUN
GAZING AS NEVER EAGLE FIXD HIS KEN
AS FROM THE FIRST A SECOND BEAM IS WONT
TO ISSUE AND REFLECTED UPWARDS RISE
EEN AS A PILGRIM BENT ON HIS RETURN
SO OF HER ACT THAT THROUGH THE EYESIGHT PASSD
INTO MY FANCY MINE WAS FORMD AND STRAIGHT
BEYOND OUR MORTAL WONT I FIXD MINE EYES
UPON THE SUN  MUCH IS ALLOWED US THERE
THAT HERE EXCEEDS OUR POWR THANKS TO THE PLACE
MADE FOR THE DWELLING OF THE HUMAN KIND

I SUFFERD IT NOT LONG AND YET SO LONG
THAT I BEHELD IT BICKRING SPARKS AROUND
AS IRON THAT COMES BOILING FROM THE FIRE
AND SUDDENLY UPON THE DAY APPEARD
A DAY NEWRISN AS HE WHO HATH THE POWER
HAD WITH ANOTHER SUN BEDECKD THE SKY

HER EYES FAST FIXD ON THE ETERNAL WHEELS
BEATRICE STOOD UNMOVD AND I WITH KEN
FIXD UPON HER FROM UPWARD GAZE REMOVD
AT HER ASPECT SUCH INWARDLY BECAME
AS GLAUCUS WHEN HE TASTED OF THE HERB
THAT MADE HIM PEER AMONG THE OCEAN GODS
WORDS MAY NOT TELL OF THAT TRANSHUMAN CHANGE
AND THEREFORE LET THE EXAMPLE SERVE THOUGH WEAK
FOR THOSE WHOM GRACE HATH BETTER PROOF IN STORE

IF I WERE ONLY WHAT THOU DIDST CREATE
THEN NEWLY LOVE BY WHOM THE HEAVN IS RULD
THOU KNOWST WHO BY THY LIGHT DIDST BEAR ME UP
WHENAS THE WHEEL WHICH THOU DOST EVER GUIDE
DESIRED SPIRIT WITH ITS HARMONY
TEMPERD OF THEE AND MEASURD CHARMD MINE EAR
THEN SEEMD TO ME SO MUCH OF HEAVN TO BLAZE
WITH THE SUNS FLAME THAT RAIN OR FLOOD NEER MADE
A LAKE SO BROAD  THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND
AND THAT GREAT LIGHT INFLAMD ME WITH DESIRE
KEENER THAN EER WAS FELT TO KNOW THEIR CAUSE

WHENCE SHE WHO SAW ME CLEARLY AS MYSELF
TO CALM MY TROUBLED MIND BEFORE I ASKD
OPEND HER LIPS AND GRACIOUS THUS BEGAN
WITH FALSE IMAGINATION THOU THYSELF
MAKST DULL SO THAT THOU SEEST NOT THE THING
WHICH THOU HADST SEEN HAD THAT BEEN SHAKEN OFF
THOU ART NOT ON THE EARTH AS THOU BELIEVST
FOR LIGHTNING SCAPD FROM ITS OWN PROPER PLACE
NEER RAN AS THOU HAST HITHER NOW RETURND

ALTHOUGH DIVESTED OF MY FIRSTRAISD DOUBT
BY THOSE BRIEF WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH SMILES
YET IN NEW DOUBT WAS I ENTANGLED MORE
AND SAID ALREADY SATISFIED I REST
FROM ADMIRATION DEEP BUT NOW ADMIRE
HOW I ABOVE THOSE LIGHTER BODIES RISE

WHENCE AFTER UTTRANCE OF A PITEOUS SIGH
SHE TOWRDS ME BENT HER EYES WITH SUCH A LOOK
AS ON HER FRENZIED CHILD A MOTHER CASTS
THEN THUS BEGAN AMONG THEMSELVES ALL THINGS
HAVE ORDER AND FROM HENCE THE FORM WHICH MAKES
THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLE GOD  IN THIS
THE HIGHER CREATURES SEE THE PRINTED STEPS
OF THAT ETERNAL WORTH WHICH IS THE END
WHITHER THE LINE IS DRAWN  ALL NATURES LEAN
IN THIS THEIR ORDER DIVERSELY SOME MORE
SOME LESS APPROACHING TO THEIR PRIMAL SOURCE
THUS THEY TO DIFFERENT HAVENS ARE MOVD ON
THROUGH THE VAST SEA OF BEING AND EACH ONE
WITH INSTINCT GIVN THAT BEARS IT IN ITS COURSE
THIS TO THE LUNAR SPHERE DIRECTS THE FIRE
THIS PROMPTS THE HEARTS OF MORTAL ANIMALS
THIS THE BRUTE EARTH TOGETHER KNITS AND BINDS
NOR ONLY CREATURES VOID OF INTELLECT
ARE AIMD AT BY THIS BOW BUT EVEN THOSE
THAT HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND LOVE ARE PIERCD
THAT PROVIDENCE WHO SO WELL ORDERS ALL
WITH HER OWN LIGHT MAKES EVER CALM THE HEAVEN
IN WHICH THE SUBSTANCE THAT HATH GREATEST SPEED
IS TURND AND THITHER NOW AS TO OUR SEAT
PREDESTIND WE ARE CARRIED BY THE FORCE
OF THAT STRONG CORD THAT NEVER LOOSES DART
BUT AT FAIR AIM AND GLAD  YET IS IT TRUE
THAT AS OFTTIMES BUT ILL ACCORDS THE FORM
TO THE DESIGN OF ART THROUGH SLUGGISHNESS
OF UNREPLYING MATTER SO THIS COURSE
IS SOMETIMES QUITTED BY THE CREATURE WHO
HATH POWER DIRECTED THUS TO BEND ELSEWHERE
AS FROM A CLOUD THE FIRE IS SEEN TO FALL
FROM ITS ORIGINAL IMPULSE WARPD TO EARTH
BY VICIOUS FONDNESS  THOU NO MORE ADMIRE
THY SOARING IF I RIGHTLY DEEM THAN LAPSE
OF TORRENT DOWNWARDS FROM A MOUNTAINS HEIGHT
THERE WOULD IN THEE FOR WONDER BE MORE CAUSE
IF FREE OF HINDRANCE THOU HADST FIXD THYSELF
BELOW LIKE FIRE UNMOVING ON THE EARTH

SO SAID SHE TURND TOWARD THE HEAVN HER FACE




CANTO II

ALL YE WHO IN SMALL BARK HAVE FOLLOWING SAILD
EAGER TO LISTEN ON THE ADVENTROUS TRACK
OF MY PROUD KEEL THAT SINGING CUTS ITS WAY
BACKWARD RETURN WITH SPEED AND YOUR OWN SHORES
REVISIT NOR PUT OUT TO OPEN SEA
WHERE LOSING ME PERCHANCE YE MAY REMAIN
BEWILDERD IN DEEP MAZE  THE WAY I PASS
NEER YET WAS RUN MINERVA BREATHES THE GALE
APOLLO GUIDES ME AND ANOTHER NINE
TO MY RAPT SIGHT THE ARCTIC BEAMS REVEAL
YE OTHER FEW WHO HAVE OUTSTRETCHD THE NECK
TIMELY FOR FOOD OF ANGELS ON WHICH HERE
THEY LIVE YET NEVER KNOW SATIETY
THROUGH THE DEEP BRINE YE FEARLESS MAY PUT OUT
YOUR VESSEL MARKING WELL THE FURROW BROAD
BEFORE YOU IN THE WAVE THAT ON BOTH SIDES
EQUAL RETURNS  THOSE GLORIOUS WHO PASSD OER
TO COLCHOS WONDERD NOT AS YE WILL DO
WHEN THEY SAW JASON FOLLOWING THE PLOUGH

THE INCREATE PERPETUAL THIRST THAT DRAWS
TOWARD THE REALM OF GODS OWN FORM BORE US
SWIFT ALMOST AS THE HEAVEN YE BEHOLD

BEATRICE UPWARD GAZD AND I ON HER
AND IN SUCH SPACE AS ON THE NOTCH A DART
IS PLACD THEN LOOSEND FLIES I SAW MYSELF
ARRIVD WHERE WONDROUS THING ENGAGD MY SIGHT
WHENCE SHE TO WHOM NO WORK OF MINE WAS HID
TURNING TO ME WITH ASPECT GLAD AS FAIR
BESPAKE ME GRATEFULLY DIRECT THY MIND
TO GOD THROUGH WHOM TO THIS FIRST STAR WE COME

ME SEEMD AS IF A CLOUD HAD COVERD US
TRANSLUCENT SOLID FIRM AND POLISHD BRIGHT
LIKE ADAMANT WHICH THE SUNS BEAM HAD SMIT
WITHIN ITSELF THE EVERDURING PEARL
RECEIVD US AS THE WAVE A RAY OF LIGHT
RECEIVES AND RESTS UNBROKEN  IF I THEN
WAS OF CORPOREAL FRAME AND IT TRANSCEND
OUR WEAKER THOUGHT HOW ONE DIMENSION THUS
ANOTHER COULD ENDURE WHICH NEEDS MUST BE
IF BODY ENTER BODY HOW MUCH MORE
MUST THE DESIRE INFLAME US TO BEHOLD
THAT ESSENCE WHICH DISCOVERS BY WHAT MEANS
GOD AND OUR NATURE JOIND  THERE WILL BE SEEN
THAT WHICH WE HOLD THROUGH FAITH NOT SHOWN BY PROOF
BUT IN ITSELF INTELLIGIBLY PLAIN
EEN AS THE TRUTH THAT MAN AT FIRST BELIEVES

I ANSWERED LADY I WITH THOUGHTS DEVOUT
SUCH AS I BEST CAN FRAME GIVE THANKS TO HIM
WHO HATH REMOVD ME FROM THE MORTAL WORLD
BUT TELL I PRAY THEE WHENCE THE GLOOMY SPOTS
UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH
GIVE RISE TO TALK OF CAIN IN FABLING QUAINT

SHE SOMEWHAT SMILD THEN SPAKE IF MORTALS ERR
IN THEIR OPINION WHEN THE KEY OF SENSE
UNLOCKS NOT SURELY WONDERS WEAPON KEEN
OUGHT NOT TO PIERCE THEE SINCE THOU FINDST THE WINGS
OF REASON TO PURSUE THE SENSES FLIGHT
ARE SHORT  BUT WHAT THY OWN THOUGHT IS DECLARE

THEN I WHAT VARIOUS HERE ABOVE APPEARS
IS CAUSD I DEEM BY BODIES DENSE OR RARE

SHE THEN RESUMD THOU CERTAINLY WILT SEE
IN FALSEHOOD THY BELIEF OERWHELMD IF WELL
THOU LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENTS WHICH I
SHALL BRING TO FACE IT  THE EIGHTH SPHERE DISPLAYS
NUMBERLESS LIGHTS THE WHICH IN KIND AND SIZE
MAY BE REMARKD OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS
IF RARE OR DENSE OF THAT WERE CAUSE ALONE
ONE SINGLE VIRTUE THEN WOULD BE IN ALL
ALIKE DISTRIBUTED OR MORE OR LESS
DIFFERENT VIRTUES NEEDS MUST BE THE FRUITS
OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE
WILL BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYD  BESIDE
IF RARITY WERE OF THAT DUSK THE CAUSE
WHICH THOU INQUIREST EITHER IN SOME PART
THAT PLANET MUST THROUGHOUT BE VOID NOR FED
WITH ITS OWN MATTER OR AS BODIES SHARE
THEIR FAT AND LEANNESS IN LIKE MANNER THIS
MUST IN ITS VOLUME CHANGE THE LEAVES  THE FIRST
IF IT WERE TRUE HAD THROUGH THE SUNS ECLIPSE
BEEN MANIFESTED BY TRANSPARENCY
OF LIGHT AS THROUGH AUGHT RARE BESIDE EFFUSD
BUT THIS IS NOT  THEREFORE REMAINS TO SEE
THE OTHER CAUSE AND IF THE OTHER FALL
ERRONEOUS SO MUST PROVE WHAT SEEMD TO THEE
IF NOT FROM SIDE TO SIDE THIS RARITY
PASS THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT WHENCE
ITS CONTRARY NO FURTHER LETS IT PASS
AND HENCE THE BEAM THAT FROM WITHOUT PROCEEDS
MUST BE POURD BACK AS COLOUR COMES THROUGH GLASS
REFLECTED WHICH BEHIND IT LEAD CONCEALS
NOW WILT THOU SAY THAT THERE OF MURKIER HUE
THAN IN THE OTHER PART THE RAY IS SHOWN
BY BEING THENCE REFRACTED FARTHER BACK
FROM THIS PERPLEXITY WILL FREE THEE SOON
EXPERIENCE IF THEREOF THOU TRIAL MAKE
THE FOUNTAIN WHENCE YOUR ARTS DERIVE THEIR STREAME
THREE MIRRORS SHALT THOU TAKE AND TWO REMOVE
FROM THEE ALIKE AND MORE REMOTE THE THIRD
BETWIXT THE FORMER PAIR SHALL MEET THINE EYES
THEN TURND TOWARD THEM CAUSE BEHIND THY BACK
A LIGHT TO STAND THAT ON THE THREE SHALL SHINE
AND THUS REFLECTED COME TO THEE FROM ALL
THOUGH THAT BEHELD MOST DISTANT DO NOT STRETCH
A SPACE SO AMPLE YET IN BRIGHTNESS THOU
WILL OWN IT EQUALING THE REST  BUT NOW
AS UNDER SNOW THE GROUND IF THE WARM RAY
SMITES IT REMAINS DISMANTLED OF THE HUE
AND COLD THAT COVERD IT BEFORE SO THEE
DISMANTLED IN THY MIND I WILL INFORM
WITH LIGHT SO LIVELY THAT THE TREMULOUS BEAM
SHALL QUIVER WHERE IT FALLS  WITHIN THE HEAVEN
WHERE PEACE DIVINE INHABITS CIRCLES ROUND
A BODY IN WHOSE VIRTUE DIES THE BEING
OF ALL THAT IT CONTAINS  THE FOLLOWING HEAVEN
THAT HATH SO MANY LIGHTS THIS BEING DIVIDES
THROUGH  DIFFERENT ESSENCES FROM IT DISTINCT
AND YET CONTAIND WITHIN IT  THE OTHER ORBS
THEIR SEPARATE DISTINCTIONS VARIOUSLY
DISPOSE FOR THEIR OWN SEED AND PRODUCE APT
THUS DO THESE ORGANS OF THE WORLD PROCEED
AS THOU BEHOLDEST NOW FROM STEP TO STEP
THEIR INFLUENCES FROM ABOVE DERIVING
AND THENCE TRANSMITTING DOWNWARDS  MARK ME WELL
HOW THROUGH THIS PASSAGE TO THE TRUTH I FORD
THE TRUTH THOU LOVST THAT THOU HENCEFORTH ALONE
MAYST KNOW TO KEEP THE SHALLOWS SAFE UNTOLD

THE VIRTUE AND MOTION OF THE SACRED ORBS
AS MALLET BY THE WORKMANS HAND MUST NEEDS
BY BLESSED MOVERS BE INSPIRD  THIS HEAVEN
MADE BEAUTEOUS BY SO MANY LUMINARIES
FROM THE DEEP SPIRIT THAT MOVES ITS CIRCLING SPHERE
ITS IMAGE TAKES AN IMPRESS AS A SEAL
AND AS THE SOUL THAT DWELLS WITHIN YOUR DUST
THROUGH MEMBERS DIFFERENT YET TOGETHER FORMD
IN DIFFERENT POWRS RESOLVES ITSELF EEN SO
THE INTELLECTUAL EFFICACY UNFOLDS
ITS GOODNESS MULTIPLIED THROUGHOUT THE STARS
ON ITS OWN UNITY REVOLVING STILL
DIFFERENT VIRTUE COMPACT DIFFERENT
MAKES WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY IT ENLIVENS
WITH WHICH IT KNITS AS LIFE IN YOU IS KNIT
FROM ITS ORIGINAL NATURE FULL OF JOY
THE VIRTUE MINGLED THROUGH THE BODY SHINES
AS JOY THROUGH PUPIL OF THE LIVING EYE
FROM HENCE PROCEEDS THAT WHICH FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
SEEMS DIFFERENT AND NOT FROM DENSE OR RARE
THIS IS THE FORMAL CAUSE THAT GENERATES
PROPORTIOND TO ITS POWER THE DUSK OR CLEAR




CANTO III

THAT SUN WHICH ERST WITH LOVE MY BOSOM WARMD
HAD OF FAIR TRUTH UNVEILD THE SWEET ASPECT
BY PROOF OF RIGHT AND OF THE FALSE REPROOF
AND I TO OWN MYSELF CONVINCD AND FREE
OF DOUBT AS MUCH AS NEEDED RAISD MY HEAD
ERECT FOR SPEECH  BUT SOON A SIGHT APPEARD
WHICH SO INTENT TO MARK IT HELD ME FIXD
THAT OF CONFESSION I NO LONGER THOUGHT

AS THROUGH TRANSLUCENT AND SMOOTH GLASS OR WAVE
CLEAR AND UNMOVD AND FLOWING NOT SO DEEP
AS THAT ITS BED IS DARK THE SHAPE RETURNS
SO FAINT OF OUR IMPICTURD LINEAMENTS
THAT ON WHITE FOREHEAD SET A PEARL AS STRONG
COMES TO THE EYE SUCH SAW I MANY A FACE
ALL STRETCHD TO SPEAK FROM WHENCE I STRAIGHT CONCEIVD
DELUSION OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH RAISD
BETWEEN THE MAN AND FOUNTAIN AMOROUS FLAME

SUDDEN AS I PERCEIVD THEM DEEMING THESE
REFLECTED SEMBLANCES TO SEE OF WHOM
THEY WERE I TURND MINE EYES AND NOTHING SAW
THEN TURND THEM BACK DIRECTED ON THE LIGHT
OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING SHOT FORTH BEAMS
FROM HER CELESTIAL EYES  WONDER NOT THOU
SHE CRYD AT THIS MY SMILING WHEN I SEE
THY CHILDISH JUDGMENT SINCE NOT YET ON TRUTH
IT RESTS THE FOOT BUT AS IT STILL IS WONT
MAKES THEE FALL BACK IN UNSOUND VACANCY
TRUE SUBSTANCES ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLDST
HITHER THROUGH FAILURE OF THEIR VOW EXILD
BUT SPEAK THOU WITH THEM LISTEN AND BELIEVE
THAT THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH FILLS THEM WITH DESIRE
PERMITS NOT FROM ITS BEAMS THEIR FEET TO STRAY

STRAIGHT TO THE SHADOW WHICH FOR CONVERSE SEEMD
MOST EARNEST I ADDRESSED ME AND BEGAN
AS ONE BY OVEREAGERNESS PERPLEXD
O SPIRIT BORN FOR JOY WHO IN THE RAYS
OF LIFE ETERNAL OF THAT SWEETNESS KNOWST
THE FLAVOUR WHICH NOT TASTED PASSES FAR
ALL APPREHENSION ME IT WELL WOULD PLEASE
IF THOU WOULDST TELL ME OF THY NAME AND THIS
YOUR STATION HERE WHENCE SHE WITH KINDNESS PROMPT
AND EYES GLISTNING WITH SMILES OUR CHARITY
TO ANY WISH BY JUSTICE INTRODUCD
BARS NOT THE DOOR NO MORE THAN SHE ABOVE
WHO WOULD HAVE ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
I WAS A VIRGIN SISTER IN THE EARTH
AND IF THY MIND OBSERVE ME WELL THIS FORM
WITH SUCH ADDITION GRACD OF LOVELINESS
WILL NOT CONCEAL ME LONG BUT THOU WILT KNOW
PICCARDA IN THE TARDIEST SPHERE THUS PLACD
HERE MID THESE OTHER BLESSED ALSO BLEST
OUR HEARTS WHOSE HIGH AFFECTIONS BURN ALONE
WITH PLEASURE FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT CONCEIVD
ADMITTED TO HIS ORDER DWELL IN JOY
AND THIS CONDITION WHICH APPEARS SO LOW
IS FOR THIS CAUSE ASSIGND US THAT OUR VOWS
WERE IN SOME PART NEGLECTED AND MADE VOID

WHENCE I TO HER REPLIED SOMETHING DIVINE
BEAMS IN YOUR COUNTENANCE WONDROUS FAIR
FROM FORMER KNOWLEDGE QUITE TRANSMUTING YOU
THEREFORE TO RECOLLECT WAS I SO SLOW
BUT WHAT THOU SAYST HATH TO MY MEMORY
GIVEN NOW SUCH AID THAT TO RETRACE YOUR FORMS
IS EASIER  YET INFORM ME YE WHO HERE
ARE HAPPY LONG YE FOR A HIGHER PLACE
MORE TO BEHOLD AND MORE IN LOVE TO DWELL

SHE WITH THOSE OTHER SPIRITS GENTLY SMILD
THEN ANSWERD WITH SUCH GLADNESS THAT SHE SEEMD
WITH LOVES FIRST FLAME TO GLOW BROTHER OUR WILL
IS IN COMPOSURE SETTLED BY THE POWER
OF CHARITY WHO MAKES US WILL ALONE
WHAT WE POSSESS AND NOUGHT BEYOND DESIRE
IF WE SHOULD WISH TO BE EXALTED MORE
THEN MUST OUR WISHES JAR WITH THE HIGH WILL
OF HIM WHO SETS US HERE WHICH IN THESE ORBS
THOU WILT CONFESS NOT POSSIBLE IF HERE
TO BE IN CHARITY MUST NEEDS BEFALL
AND IF HER NATURE WELL THOU CONTEMPLATE
RATHER IT IS INHERENT IN THIS STATE
OF BLESSEDNESS TO KEEP OURSELVES WITHIN
THE DIVINE WILL BY WHICH OUR WILLS WITH HIS
ARE ONE  SO THAT AS WE FROM STEP TO STEP
ARE PLACD THROUGHOUT THIS KINGDOM PLEASES ALL
EEN AS OUR KING WHO IN US PLANTS HIS WILL
AND IN HIS WILL IS OUR TRANQUILLITY
IT IS THE MIGHTY OCEAN WHITHER TENDS
WHATEVER IT CREATES AND NATURE MAKES

THEN SAW I CLEARLY HOW EACH SPOT IN HEAVN
IS PARADISE THOUGH WITH LIKE GRACIOUS DEW
THE SUPREME VIRTUE SHOWR NOT OVER ALL

BUT AS IT CHANCES IF ONE SORT OF FOOD
HATH SATIATED AND OF ANOTHER STILL
THE APPETITE REMAINS THAT THIS IS ASKD
AND THANKS FOR THAT RETURND EEN SO DID I
IN WORD AND MOTION BENT FROM HER TO LEARN
WHAT WEB IT WAS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD NOT DRAWN
THE SHUTTLE TO ITS POINT  SHE THUS BEGAN
EXALTED WORTH AND PERFECTNESS OF LIFE
THE LADY HIGHER UP ENSHRINE IN HEAVEN
BY WHOSE PURE LAWS UPON YOUR NETHER EARTH
THE ROBE AND VEIL THEY WEAR TO THAT INTENT
THAT EEN TILL DEATH THEY MAY KEEP WATCH OR SLEEP
WITH THEIR GREAT BRIDEGROOM WHO ACCEPTS EACH VOW
WHICH TO HIS GRACIOUS PLEASURE LOVE CONFORMS
FROM THE WORLD TO FOLLOW HER WHEN YOUNG
ESCAPD AND IN HER VESTURE MANTLING ME
MADE PROMISE OF THE WAY HER SECT ENJOINS
THEREAFTER MEN FOR ILL THAN GOOD MORE APT
FORTH SNATCHD ME FROM THE PLEASANT CLOISTERS PALE
GOD KNOWS HOW AFTER THAT MY LIFE WAS FRAMD
THIS OTHER SPLENDID SHAPE WHICH THOU BEHOLDST
AT MY RIGHT SIDE BURNING WITH ALL THE LIGHT
OF THIS OUR ORB WHAT OF MYSELF I TELL
MAY TO HERSELF APPLY  FROM HER LIKE ME
A SISTER WITH LIKE VIOLENCE WERE TORN
THE SAINTLY FOLDS THAT SHADED HER FAIR BROWS
EEN WHEN SHE TO THE WORLD AGAIN WAS BROUGHT
IN SPITE OF HER OWN WILL AND BETTER WONT
YET NOT FOR THAT THE BOSOMS INWARD VEIL
DID SHE RENOUNCE  THIS IS THE LUMINARY
OF MIGHTY CONSTANCE WHO FROM THAT LOUD BLAST
WHICH BLEW THE SECOND OVER SUABIAS REALM
THAT POWER PRODUCD WHICH WAS THE THIRD AND LAST

SHE CEASD FROM FURTHER TALK AND THEN BEGAN
AVE MARIA SINGING AND WITH THAT SONG
VANISHD AS HEAVY SUBSTANCE THROUGH DEEP WAVE

MINE EYE THAT FAR AS IT WAS CAPABLE
PURSUED HER WHEN IN DIMNESS SHE WAS LOST
TURND TO THE MARK WHERE GREATER WANT IMPELLD
AND BENT ON BEATRICE ALL ITS GAZE
BUT SHE AS LIGHTNING BEAMD UPON MY LOOKS
SO THAT THE SIGHT SUSTAIND IT NOT AT FIRST
WHENCE I TO QUESTION HER BECAME LESS PROMPT




CANTO IV

BETWEEN TWO KINDS OF FOOD BOTH EQUALLY
REMOTE AND TEMPTING FIRST A MAN MIGHT DIE
OF HUNGER ERE HE ONE COULD FREELY CHOOSE
EEN SO WOULD STAND A LAMB BETWEEN THE MAW
OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES IN DREAD OF BOTH ALIKE
EEN SO BETWEEN TWO DEER A DOG WOULD STAND
WHEREFORE IF I WAS SILENT FAULT NOR PRAISE
I TO MYSELF IMPUTE BY EQUAL DOUBTS
HELD IN SUSPENSE SINCE OF NECESSITY
IT HAPPEND  SILENT WAS I YET DESIRE
WAS PAINTED IN MY LOOKS AND THUS I SPAKE
MY WISH MORE EARNESTLY THAN LANGUAGE COULD

AS DANIEL WHEN THE HAUGHTY KING HE FREED
FROM IRE THAT SPURRD HIM ON TO DEEDS UNJUST
AND VIOLENT SO LOOKD BEATRICE THEN

WELL I DISCERN SHE THUS HER WORDS ADDRESSD
HOW CONTRARY DESIRES EACH WAY CONSTRAIN THEE
SO THAT THY ANXIOUS THOUGHT IS IN ITSELF
BOUND UP AND STIFLED NOR BREATHES FREELY FORTH
THOU ARGUEST IF THE GOOD INTENT REMAIN
WHAT REASON THAT ANOTHERS VIOLENCE
SHOULD STINT THE MEASURE OF MY FAIR DESERT

CAUSE TOO THOU FINDST FOR DOUBT IN THAT IT SEEMS
THAT SPIRITS TO THE STARS AS PLATO DEEMD
RETURN  THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH THY WILL
URGE EQUALLY AND THEREFORE I THE FIRST
OF THAT WILL TREAT WHICH HATH THE MORE OF GALL
OF SERAPHIM HE WHO IS MOST ENSKYD
MOSES AND SAMUEL AND EITHER JOHN
CHOOSE WHICH THOU WILT NOR EVEN MARYS SELF
HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVN THEIR SEATS
THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS WHICH SO LATE THOU SAWST
NOR MORE OR FEWER YEARS EXIST BUT ALL
MAKE THE FIRST CIRCLE BEAUTEOUS DIVERSELY
PARTAKING OF SWEET LIFE AS MORE OR LESS
AFFLATION OF ETERNAL BLISS PERVADES THEM
HERE WERE THEY SHOWN THEE NOT THAT FATE ASSIGNS
THIS FOR THEIR SPHERE BUT FOR A SIGN TO THEE
OF THAT CELESTIAL FURTHEST FROM THE HEIGHT
THUS NEEDS THAT YE MAY APPREHEND WE SPEAK
SINCE FROM THINGS SENSIBLE ALONE YE LEARN
THAT WHICH DIGESTED RIGHTLY AFTER TURNS
TO INTELLECTUAL  FOR NO OTHER CAUSE
THE SCRIPTURE CONDESCENDING GRACIOUSLY
TO YOUR PERCEPTION HANDS AND FEET TO GOD
ATTRIBUTES NOR SO MEANS AND HOLY CHURCH
DOTH REPRESENT WITH HUMAN COUNTENANCE
GABRIEL AND MICHAEL AND HIM WHO MADE
TOBIAS WHOLE  UNLIKE WHAT HERE THOU SEEST
THE JUDGMENT OF TIMAEUS WHO AFFIRMS
EACH SOUL RESTORD TO ITS PARTICULAR STAR
BELIEVING IT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN THENCE
WHEN NATURE GAVE IT TO INFORM HER MOLD
SINCE TO APPEARANCE HIS INTENTION IS
EEN WHAT HIS WORDS DECLARE OR ELSE TO SHUN
DERISION HAPLY THUS HE HATH DISGUISD
HIS TRUE OPINION  IF HIS MEANING BE
THAT TO THE INFLUENCING OF THESE ORBS REVERT
THE HONOUR AND THE BLAME IN HUMAN ACTS
PERCHANCE HE DOTH NOT WHOLLY MISS THE TRUTH
THIS PRINCIPLE NOT UNDERSTOOD ARIGHT
EREWHILE PERVERTED WELL NIGH ALL THE WORLD
SO THAT IT FELL TO FABLED NAMES OF JOVE
AND MERCURY AND MARS  THAT OTHER DOUBT
WHICH MOVES THEE IS LESS HARMFUL FOR IT BRINGS
NO PERIL OF REMOVING THEE FROM ME

THAT TO THE EYE OF MAN OUR JUSTICE SEEMS
UNJUST IS ARGUMENT FOR FAITH AND NOT
FOR HERETIC DECLENSION  TO THE END
THIS TRUTH MAY STAND MORE CLEARLY IN YOUR VIEW
I WILL CONTENT THEE EVEN TO THY WISH

IF VIOLENCE BE WHEN THAT WHICH SUFFERS NOUGHT
CONSENTS TO THAT WHICH FORCETH NOT FOR THIS
THESE SPIRITS STOOD EXCULPATE  FOR THE WILL
THAT WILL NOT STILL SURVIVES UNQUENCHD AND DOTH
AS NATURE DOTH IN FIRE THO VIOLENCE
WREST IT A THOUSAND TIMES FOR IF IT YIELD
OR MORE OR LESS SO FAR IT FOLLOWS FORCE
AND THUS DID THESE WHOM THEY HAD POWER TO SEEK
THE HALLOWD PLACE AGAIN  IN THEM HAD WILL
BEEN PERFECT SUCH AS ONCE UPON THE BARS
HELD LAURENCE FIRM OR WROUGHT IN SCAEVOLA
TO HIS OWN HAND REMORSELESS TO THE PATH
WHENCE THEY WERE DRAWN THEIR STEPS HAD HASTEND BACK
WHEN LIBERTY RETURND BUT IN TOO FEW
RESOLVE SO STEADFAST DWELLS  AND BY THESE WORDS
IF DULY WEIGHD THAT ARGUMENT IS VOID
WHICH OFT MIGHT HAVE PERPLEXD THEE STILL  BUT NOW
ANOTHER QUESTION THWARTS THEE WHICH TO SOLVE
MIGHT TRY THY PATIENCE WITHOUT BETTER AID
I HAVE NO DOUBT INSTILLD INTO THY MIND
THAT BLESSED SPIRIT MAY NOT LIE SINCE NEAR
THE SOURCE OF PRIMAL TRUTH IT DWELLS FOR AYE
AND THOU MIGHTST AFTER OF PICCARDA LEARN
THAT CONSTANCE HELD AFFECTION TO THE VEIL
SO THAT SHE SEEMS TO CONTRADICT ME HERE
NOT SELDOM BROTHER IT HATH CHANCD FOR MEN
TO DO WHAT THEY HAD GLADLY LEFT UNDONE
YET TO SHUN PERIL THEY HAVE DONE AMISS
EEN AS ALCMAEON AT HIS FATHERS SUIT
SLEW HIS OWN MOTHER SO MADE PITILESS
NOT TO LOSE PITY  ON THIS POINT BETHINK THEE
THAT FORCE AND WILL ARE BLENDED IN SUCH WISE
AS NOT TO MAKE THE OFFENCE EXCUSABLE
ABSOLUTE WILL AGREES NOT TO THE WRONG
THAT INASMUCH AS THERE IS FEAR OF WOE
FROM NONCOMPLIANCE IT AGREES  OF WILL
THUS ABSOLUTE PICCARDA SPAKE AND I
OF TH OTHER SO THAT BOTH HAVE TRULY SAID

SUCH WAS THE FLOW OF THAT PURE RILL THAT WELLD
FROM FORTH THE FOUNTAIN OF ALL TRUTH AND SUCH
THE REST THAT TO MY WONDRING THOUGHTS I FOUND

O THOU OF PRIMAL LOVE THE PRIME DELIGHT
GODDESS  I STRAIGHT REPLYD WHOSE LIVELY WORDS
STILL SHED NEW HEAT AND VIGOUR THROUGH MY SOUL
AFFECTION FAILS ME TO REQUITE THY GRACE
WITH EQUAL SUM OF GRATITUDE BE HIS
TO RECOMPENSE WHO SEES AND CAN REWARD THEE
WELL I DISCERN THAT BY THAT TRUTH ALONE
ENLIGHTEND BEYOND WHICH NO TRUTH MAY ROAM
OUR MIND CAN SATISFY HER THIRST TO KNOW
THEREIN SHE RESTETH EEN AS IN HIS LAIR
THE WILD BEAST SOON AS SHE HATH REACHD THAT BOUND
AND SHE HATH POWER TO REACH IT ELSE DESIRE
WERE GIVEN TO NO END  AND THENCE DOTH DOUBT
SPRING LIKE A SHOOT AROUND THE STOCK OF TRUTH
AND IT IS NATURE WHICH FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT
ON TO THE SUMMIT PROMPTS US  THIS INVITES
THIS DOTH ASSURE ME LADY REVRENTLY
TO ASK THEE OF OTHER TRUTH THAT YET
IS DARK TO ME  I FAIN WOULD KNOW IF MAN
BY OTHER WORKS WELL DONE MAY SO SUPPLY
THE FAILURE OF HIS VOWS THAT IN YOUR SCALE
THEY LACK NOT WEIGHT  I SPAKE AND ON ME STRAIGHT
BEATRICE LOOKD WITH EYES THAT SHOT FORTH SPARKS
OF LOVE CELESTIAL IN SUCH COPIOUS STREAM
THAT VIRTUE SINKING IN ME OVERPOWERD
I TURND AND DOWNWARD BENT CONFUSD MY SIGHT




CANTO V

IF BEYOND EARTHLY WONT THE FLAME OF LOVE
ILLUME ME SO THAT I OERCOME THY POWER
OF VISION MARVEL NOT BUT LEARN THE CAUSE
IN THAT PERFECTION OF THE SIGHT WHICH SOON
AS APPREHENDING HASTENETH ON TO REACH
THE GOOD IT APPREHENDS  I WELL DISCERN
HOW IN THINE INTELLECT ALREADY SHINES
THE LIGHT ETERNAL WHICH TO VIEW ALONE
NEER FAILS TO KINDLE LOVE AND IF AUGHT ELSE
YOUR LOVE SEDUCES T IS BUT THAT IT SHOWS
SOME ILLMARKD VESTIGE OF THAT PRIMAL BEAM

THIS WOULDST THOU KNOW IF FAILURE OF THE VOW
BY OTHER SERVICE MAY BE SO SUPPLIED
AS FROM SELFQUESTION TO ASSURE THE SOUL

THUS SHE HER WORDS NOT HEEDLESS OF MY WISH
BEGAN AND THUS AS ONE WHO BREAKS NOT OFF
DISCOURSE CONTINUED IN HER SAINTLY STRAIN
SUPREME OF GIFTS WHICH GOD CREATING GAVE
OF HIS FREE BOUNTY SIGN MOST EVIDENT
OF GOODNESS AND IN HIS ACCOUNT MOST PRIZD
WAS LIBERTY OF WILL THE BOON WHEREWITH
ALL INTELLECTUAL CREATURES AND THEM SOLE
HE HATH ENDOWD  HENCE NOW THOU MAYST INFER
OF WHAT HIGH WORTH THE VOW WHICH SO IS FRAMD
THAT WHEN MAN OFFERS GOD WELLPLEASD ACCEPTS
FOR IN THE COMPACT BETWEEN GOD AND HIM
THIS TREASURE SUCH AS I DESCRIBE IT TO THEE
HE MAKES THE VICTIM AND OF HIS OWN ACT
WHAT COMPENSATION THEREFORE MAY HE FIND
IF THAT WHEREOF THOU HAST OBLATION MADE
BY USING WELL THOU THINKST TO CONSECRATE
THOU WOULDST OF THEFT DO CHARITABLE DEED
THUS I RESOLVE THEE OF THE GREATER POINT

BUT FORASMUCH AS HOLY CHURCH HEREIN
DISPENSING SEEMS TO CONTRADICT THE TRUTH
I HAVE DISCOVERD TO THEE YET BEHOOVES
THOU REST A LITTLE LONGER AT THE BOARD
ERE THE CRUDE ALIMENT WHICH THOU HAST TAKEN
DIGESTED FITLY TO NUTRITION TURN
OPEN THY MIND TO WHAT I NOW UNFOLD
AND GIVE IT INWARD KEEPING  KNOWLEDGE COMES
OF LEARNING WELL RETAIND UNFRUITFUL ELSE

THIS SACRIFICE IN ESSENCE OF TWO THINGS
CONSISTETH ONE IS THAT WHEREOF T IS MADE
THE COVENANT THE OTHER  FOR THE LAST
IT NEER IS CANCELLD IF NOT KEPT AND HENCE
I SPAKE EREWHILE SO STRICTLY OF ITS FORCE
FOR THIS IT WAS ENJOIND THE ISRAELITES
THOUGH LEAVE WERE GIVN THEM AS THOU KNOWST TO CHANGE
THE OFFERING STILL TO OFFER  TH OTHER PART
THE MATTER AND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE VOW
MAY WELL BE SUCH TO THAT WITHOUT OFFENCE
IT MAY FOR OTHER SUBSTANCE BE EXCHANGD
BUT AT HIS OWN DISCRETION NONE MAY SHIFT
THE BURDEN ON HIS SHOULDERS UNRELEASD
BY EITHER KEY THE YELLOW AND THE WHITE
NOR DEEM OF ANY CHANGE AS LESS THAN VAIN
IF THE LAST BOND BE NOT WITHIN THE NEW
INCLUDED AS THE QUATRE IN THE SIX
NO SATISFACTION THEREFORE CAN BE PAID
FOR WHAT SO PRECIOUS IN THE BALANCE WEIGHS
THAT ALL IN COUNTERPOISE MUST KICK THE BEAM
TAKE THEN NO VOW AT RANDOM TAEN WITH FAITH
PRESERVE IT YET NOT BENT AS JEPHTHAH ONCE
BLINDLY TO EXECUTE A RASH RESOLVE
WHOM BETTER IT HAD SUITED TO EXCLAIM
I HAVE DONE ILL THAN TO REDEEM HIS PLEDGE
BY DOING WORSE OR NOT UNLIKE TO HIM
IN FOLLY THAT GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS
WHENCE ON THE ALTER IPHIGENIA MOURND
HER VIRGIN BEAUTY AND HATH SINCE MADE MOURN
BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE EVEN ALL WHO HEAR
OF SO FELL SACRIFICE  BE YE MORE STAID
O CHRISTIANS NOT LIKE FEATHER BY EACH WIND
REMOVABLE NOR THINK TO CLEANSE OURSELVES
IN EVERY WATER  EITHER TESTAMENT
THE OLD AND NEW IS YOURS AND FOR YOUR GUIDE
THE SHEPHERD OF THE CHURCH LET THIS SUFFICE
TO SAVE YOU  WHEN BY EVIL LUST ENTICD
REMEMBER YE BE MEN NOT SENSELESS BEASTS
NOR LET THE JEW WHO DWELLETH IN YOUR STREETS
HOLD YOU IN MOCKRY  BE NOT AS THE LAMB
THAT FICKLE WANTON LEAVES ITS MOTHERS MILK
TO DALLY WITH ITSELF IN IDLE PLAY

SUCH WERE THE WORDS THAT BEATRICE SPAKE
THESE ENDED TO THAT REGION WHERE THE WORLD
IS LIVELIEST FULL OF FOND DESIRE SHE TURND

THOUGH MAINLY PROMPT NEW QUESTION TO PROPOSE
HER SILENCE AND CHANGD LOOK DID KEEP ME DUMB
AND AS THE ARROW ERE THE CORD IS STILL
LEAPETH UNTO ITS MARK SO ON WE SPED
INTO THE SECOND REALM  THERE I BEHELD
THE DAME SO JOYOUS ENTER THAT THE ORB
GREW BRIGHTER AT HER SMILES AND IF THE STAR
WERE MOVD TO GLADNESS WHAT THEN WAS MY CHEER
WHOM NATURE HATH MADE APT FOR EVERY CHANGE

AS IN A QUIET AND CLEAR LAKE THE FISH
IF AUGHT APPROACH THEM FROM WITHOUT DO DRAW
TOWARDS IT DEEMING IT THEIR FOOD SO DREW
FULL MORE THAN THOUSAND SPLENDOURS TOWARDS US
AND IN EACH ONE WAS HEARD LO ONE ARRIVD
TO MULTIPLY OUR LOVES AND AS EACH CAME
THE SHADOW STREAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE NEW
WITNESSD AUGMENTED JOY  HERE READER THINK
IF THOU DIDST MISS THE SEQUEL OF MY TALE
TO KNOW THE REST HOW SORELY THOU WOULDST CRAVE
AND THOU SHALT SEE WHAT VEHEMENT DESIRE
POSSESSD ME AS SOON AS THESE HAD MET MY VIEW
TO KNOW THEIR STATE  O BORN IN HAPPY HOUR
THOU TO WHOM GRACE VOUCHSAFES OR ERE THY CLOSE
OF FLESHLY WARFARE TO BEHOLD THE THRONES
OF THAT ETERNAL TRIUMPH KNOW TO US
THE LIGHT COMMUNICATED WHICH THROUGH HEAVEN
EXPATIATES WITHOUT BOUND  THEREFORE IF AUGHT
THOU OF OUR BEAMS WOULDST BORROW FOR THINE AID
SPARE NOT AND OF OUR RADIANCE TAKE THY FILL

THUS OF THOSE PITEOUS SPIRITS ONE BESPAKE ME
AND BEATRICE NEXT SAY ON AND TRUST
AS UNTO GODSHOW IN THE LIGHT SUPREME
THOU HARBOURST AND FROM THENCE THE VIRTUE BRINGST
THAT SPARKLING IN THINE EYES DENOTES THY JOY
I MARK BUT WHO THOU ART AM STILL TO SEEK
OR WHEREFORE WORTHY SPIRIT FOR THY LOT
THIS SPHERE ASSIGND THAT OFT FROM MORTAL KEN
IS VEILD BY OTHERS BEAMS  I SAID AND TURND
TOWARD THE LUSTRE THAT WITH GREETING KIND
EREWHILE HAD HAILD ME  FORTHWITH BRIGHTER FAR
THAN ERST IT WAXD AND AS HIMSELF THE SUN
HIDES THROUGH EXCESS OF LIGHT WHEN HIS WARM GAZE
HATH ON THE MANTLE OF THICK VAPOURS PREYD
WITHIN ITS PROPER RAY THE SAINTLY SHAPE
WAS THROUGH INCREASE OF GLADNESS THUS CONCEALD
AND SHROUDED SO IN SPLENDOUR ANSWERD ME
EEN AS THE TENOUR OF MY SONG DECLARES




CANTO VI

AFTER THAT CONSTANTINE THE EAGLE TURND
AGAINST THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVN THAT ROLLD
CONSENTING WITH ITS COURSE WHEN HE OF YORE
LAVINIAS SPOUSE WAS LEADER OF THE FLIGHT
A HUNDRED YEARS TWICE TOLD AND MORE HIS SEAT
AT EUROPES EXTREME POINT THE BIRD OF JOVE
HELD NEAR THE MOUNTAINS WHENCE HE ISSUED FIRST
THERE UNDER SHADOW OF HIS SACRED PLUMES
SWAYING THE WORLD TILL THROUGH SUCCESSIVE HANDS
TO MINE HE CAME DEVOLVD  CAESAR I WAS
AND AM JUSTINIAN DESTIND BY THE WILL
OF THAT PRIME LOVE WHOSE INFLUENCE I FEEL
FROM VAIN EXCESS TO CLEAR TH ENCUMBERD LAWS
OR ERE THAT WORK ENGAGD ME I DID HOLD
CHRISTS NATURE MERELY HUMAN WITH SUCH FAITH
CONTENTED  BUT THE BLESSED AGAPETE
WHO WAS CHIEF SHEPHERD HE WITH WARNING VOICE
TO THE TRUE FAITH RECALLD ME  I BELIEVD
HIS WORDS AND WHAT HE TAUGHT NOW PLAINLY SEE
AS THOU IN EVERY CONTRADICTION SEEST
THE TRUE AND FALSE OPPOSD  SOON AS MY FEET
WERE TO THE CHURCH RECLAIMD TO MY GREAT TASK
BY INSPIRATION OF GODS GRACE IMPELLD
I GAVE ME WHOLLY AND CONSIGND MINE ARMS
TO BELISARIUS WITH WHOM HEAVENS RIGHT HAND
WAS LINKD IN SUCH CONJOINTMENT T WAS A SIGN
THAT I SHOULD REST  TO THY FIRST QUESTION THUS
I SHAPE MINE ANSWER WHICH WERE ENDED HERE
BUT THAT ITS TENDENCY DOTH PROMPT PERFORCE
TO SOME ADDITION THAT THOU WELL MAYST MARK
WHAT REASON ON EACH SIDE THEY HAVE TO PLEAD
BY WHOM THAT HOLIEST BANNER IS WITHSTOOD
BOTH WHO PRETEND ITS POWER AND WHO OPPOSE

BEGINNING FROM THAT HOUR WHEN PALLAS DIED
TO GIVE IT RULE BEHOLD THE VALOROUS DEEDS
HAVE MADE IT WORTHY REVERENCE  NOT UNKNOWN
TO THEE HOW FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE
IT DWELT IN ALBA UP TO THOSE FELL LISTS
WHERE FOR ITS SAKE WERE MET THE RIVAL THREE
NOR AUGHT UNKNOWN TO THEE WHICH IT ACHIEVD
DOWN TO THE SABINES WRONG TO LUCRECE WOE
WITH ITS SEVN KINGS CONQURING THE NATION ROUND
NOR ALL IT WROUGHT BY ROMAN WORTHIES HOME
GAINST BRENNUS AND TH EPIROT PRINCE AND HOSTS
OF SINGLE CHIEFS OR STATES IN LEAGUE COMBIND
OF SOCIAL WARFARE HENCE TORQUATUS STERN
AND QUINTIUS NAMD OF HIS NEGLECTED LOCKS
THE DECII AND THE FABII HENCE ACQUIRD
THEIR FAME WHICH I WITH DUTEOUS ZEAL EMBALM
BY IT THE PRIDE OF ARAB HORDES WAS QUELLD
WHEN THEY LED ON BY HANNIBAL OERPASSD
THE ALPINE ROCKS WHENCE GLIDE THY CURRENTS PO
BENEATH ITS GUIDANCE IN THEIR PRIME OF DAYS
SCIPIO AND POMPEY TRIUMPHD AND THAT HILL
UNDER WHOSE SUMMIT THOU DIDST SEE THE LIGHT
RUED ITS STERN BEARING  AFTER NEAR THE HOUR
WHEN HEAVN WAS MINDED THAT OER ALL THE WORLD
HIS OWN DEEP CALM SHOULD BROOD TO CAESARS HAND
DID ROME CONSIGN IT AND WHAT THEN IT WROUGHT
FROM VAR UNTO THE RHINE SAW ISERES FLOOD
SAW LOIRE AND SEINE AND EVERY VALE THAT FILLS
THE TORRENT RHONE  WHAT AFTER THAT IT WROUGHT
WHEN FROM RAVENNA IT CAME FORTH AND LEAPD
THE RUBICON WAS OF SO BOLD A FLIGHT
THAT TONGUE NOR PEN MAY FOLLOW IT  TOWRDS SPAIN
IT WHEELD ITS BANDS THEN TOWRD DYRRACHIUM SMOTE
AND ON PHARSALIA WITH SO FIERCE A PLUNGE
EEN THE WARM NILE WAS CONSCIOUS TO THE PANG
ITS NATIVE SHORES ANTANDROS AND THE STREAMS
OF SIMOIS REVISITED AND THERE
WHERE HECTOR LIES THEN ILL FOR PTOLEMY
HIS PENNONS SHOOK AGAIN LIGHTNING THENCE FELL
ON JUBA AND THE NEXT UPON YOUR WEST
AT SOUND OF THE POMPEIAN TRUMP RETURND

WHAT FOLLOWING AND IN ITS NEXT BEARERS GRIPE
IT WROUGHT IS NOW BY CASSIUS AND BRUTUS
BARKD OFF IN HELL AND BY PERUGIAS SONS
AND MODENAS WAS MOURND  HENCE WEEPETH STILL
SAD CLEOPATRA WHO PURSUED BY IT
TOOK FROM THE ADDER BLACK AND SUDDEN DEATH
WITH HIM IT RAN EEN TO THE RED SEA COAST
WITH HIM COMPOSD THE WORLD TO SUCH A PEACE
THAT OF HIS TEMPLE JANUS BARRD THE DOOR

BUT ALL THE MIGHTY STANDARD YET HAD WROUGHT
AND WAS APPOINTED TO PERFORM THEREAFTER
THROUGHOUT THE MORTAL KINGDOM WHICH IT SWAYD
FALLS IN APPEARANCE DWINDLED AND OBSCURD
IF ONE WITH STEADY EYE AND PERFECT THOUGHT
ON THE THIRD CAESAR LOOK FOR TO HIS HANDS
THE LIVING JUSTICE IN WHOSE BREATH I MOVE
COMMITTED GLORY EEN INTO HIS HANDS
TO EXECUTE THE VENGEANCE OF ITS WRATH

HEAR NOW AND WONDER AT WHAT NEXT I TELL
AFTER WITH TITUS IT WAS SENT TO WREAK
VENGEANCE FOR VENGEANCE OF THE ANCIENT SIN
AND WHEN THE LOMBARD TOOTH WITH FANGS IMPURE
DID GORE THE BOSOM OF THE HOLY CHURCH
UNDER ITS WINGS VICTORIOUS CHARLEMAGNE
SPED TO HER RESCUE  JUDGE THEN FOR THYSELF
OF THOSE WHOM I EREWHILE ACCUSD TO THEE
WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW GRIEVOUS THEIR OFFENDING
WHO ARE THE CAUSE OF ALL YOUR ILLS  THE ONE
AGAINST THE UNIVERSAL ENSIGN REARS
THE YELLOW LILIES AND WITH PARTIAL AIM
THAT TO HIMSELF THE OTHER ARROGATES
SO THAT T IS HARD TO SEE WHICH MORE OFFENDS
BE YOURS YE GHIBELLINES TO VEIL YOUR ARTS
BENEATH ANOTHER STANDARD ILL IS THIS
FOLLOWD OF HIM WHO SEVERS IT AND JUSTICE
AND LET NOT WITH HIS GUELPHS THE NEWCROWND CHARLES
ASSAIL IT BUT THOSE TALONS HOLD IN DREAD
WHICH FROM A LION OF MORE LOFTY PORT
HAVE RENT THE EASING  MANY A TIME ERE NOW
THE SONS HAVE FOR THE SIRES TRANSGRESSION WAILD
NOR LET HIM TRUST THE FOND BELIEF THAT HEAVN
WILL TRUCK ITS ARMOUR FOR HIS LILIED SHIELD

THIS LITTLE STAR IS FURNISHD WITH GOOD SPIRITS
WHOSE MORTAL LIVES WERE BUSIED TO THAT END
THAT HONOUR AND RENOWN MIGHT WAIT ON THEM
AND WHEN DESIRES THUS ERR IN THEIR INTENTION
TRUE LOVE MUST NEEDS ASCEND WITH SLACKER BEAM
BUT IT IS PART OF OUR DELIGHT TO MEASURE
OUR WAGES WITH THE MERIT AND ADMIRE
THE CLOSE PROPORTION  HENCE DOTH HEAVNLY JUSTICE
TEMPER SO EVENLY AFFECTION IN US
IT NEER CAN WARP TO ANY WRONGFULNESS
OF DIVERSE VOICES IS SWEET MUSIC MADE
SO IN OUR LIFE THE DIFFERENT DEGREES
RENDER SWEET HARMONY AMONG THESE WHEELS

WITHIN THE PEARL THAT NOW ENCLOSETH US
SHINES ROMEOS LIGHT WHOSE GOODLY DEED AND FAIR
MET ILL ACCEPTANCE  BUT THE PROVENCALS
THAT WERE HIS FOES HAVE LITTLE CAUSE FOR MIRTH
ILL SHAPES THAT MAN HIS COURSE WHO MAKES HIS WRONG
OF OTHERS WORTH  FOUR DAUGHTERS WERE THERE BORN
TO RAYMOND BERENGER AND EVERY ONE
BECAME A QUEEN AND THIS FOR HIM DID ROMEO
THOUGH OF MEAN STATE AND FROM A FOREIGN LAND
YET ENVIOUS TONGUES INCITED HIM TO ASK
A RECKONING OF THAT JUST ONE WHO RETURND
TWELVE FOLD TO HIM FOR TEN  AGED AND POOR
HE PARTED THENCE AND IF THE WORLD DID KNOW
THE HEART HE HAD BEGGING HIS LIFE BY MORSELS
T WOULD DEEM THE PRAISE IT YIELDS HIM SCANTLY DEALT




CANTO VII

HOSANNA SANCTUS DEUS SABAOTH
SUPERILLUSTRANS CLARITATE TUA
FELICES IGNES HORUM MALAHOTH
THUS CHANTING SAW I TURN THAT SUBSTANCE BRIGHT
WITH FOURFOLD LUSTRE TO ITS ORB AGAIN
REVOLVING AND THE REST UNTO THEIR DANCE
WITH IT MOVD ALSO AND LIKE SWIFTEST SPARKS
IN SUDDEN DISTANCE FROM MY SIGHT WERE VEILD

ME DOUBT POSSESSD AND SPEAK IT WHISPERD ME
SPEAK SPEAK UNTO THY LADY THAT SHE QUENCH
THY THIRST WITH DROPS OF SWEETNESS  YET BLANK AWE
WHICH LORDS IT OER ME EVEN AT THE SOUND
OF BEATRICES NAME DID BOW ME DOWN
AS ONE IN SLUMBER HELD  NOT LONG THAT MOOD
BEATRICE SUFFERD SHE WITH SUCH A SMILE
AS MIGHT HAVE MADE ONE BLEST AMID THE FLAMES
BEAMING UPON ME THUS HER WORDS BEGAN
THOU IN THY THOUGHT ART PONDRING AS I DEEM
AND WHAT I DEEM IS TRUTH HOW JUST REVENGE
COULD BE WITH JUSTICE PUNISHD FROM WHICH DOUBT
I SOON WILL FREE THEE SO THOU MARK MY WORDS
FOR THEY OF WEIGHTY MATTER SHALL POSSESS THEE

THAT MAN WHO WAS UNBORN HIMSELF CONDEMND
AND IN HIMSELF ALL WHO SINCE HIM HAVE LIVD
HIS OFFSPRING WHENCE BELOW THE HUMAN KIND
LAY SICK IN GRIEVOUS ERROR MANY AN AGE
UNTIL IT PLEASD THE WORD OF GOD TO COME
AMONGST THEM DOWN TO HIS OWN PERSON JOINING
THE NATURE FROM ITS MAKER FAR ESTRANGD
BY THE MERE ACT OF HIS ETERNAL LOVE
CONTEMPLATE HERE THE WONDER I UNFOLD
THE NATURE WITH ITS MAKER THUS CONJOIND
CREATED FIRST WAS BLAMELESS PURE AND GOOD
BUT THROUGH ITSELF ALONE WAS DRIVEN FORTH
FROM PARADISE BECAUSE IT HAD ESCHEWD
THE WAY OF TRUTH AND LIFE TO EVIL TURND
NEER THEN WAS PENALTY SO JUST AS THAT
INFLICTED BY THE CROSS IF THOU REGARD
THE NATURE IN ASSUMPTION DOOMD NEER WRONG
SO GREAT IN REFERENCE TO HIM WHO TOOK
SUCH NATURE ON HIM AND ENDURD THE DOOM
GOD THEREFORE AND THE JEWS ONE SENTENCE PLEASED
SO DIFFERENT EFFECTS FLOWD FROM ONE ACT
AND HEAVN WAS OPEND THOUGH THE EARTH DID QUAKE
COUNT IT NOT HARD HENCEFORTH WHEN THOU DOST HEAR
THAT A JUST VENGEANCE WAS BY RIGHTEOUS COURT
JUSTLY REVENGD  BUT YET I SEE THY MIND
BY THOUGHT ON THOUGHT ARISING SORE PERPLEXD
AND WITH HOW VEHEMENT DESIRE IT ASKS
SOLUTION OF THE MAZE  WHAT I HAVE HEARD
IS PLAIN THOU SAYST BUT WHEREFORE GOD THIS WAY
FOR OUR REDEMPTION CHOSE ELUDES MY SEARCH

BROTHER NO EYE OF MAN NOT PERFECTED
NOR FULLY RIPEND IN THE FLAME OF LOVE
MAY FATHOM THIS DECREE  IT IS A MARK
IN SOOTH MUCH AIMD AT AND BUT LITTLE KENND
AND I WILL THEREFORE SHOW THEE WHY SUCH WAY
WAS WORTHIEST  THE CELESTIAL LOVE THAT SPUME
ALL ENVYING IN ITS BOUNTY IN ITSELF
WITH SUCH EFFULGENCE BLAZETH AS SENDS FORTH
ALL BEAUTEOUS THINGS ETERNAL  WHAT DISTILS
IMMEDIATE THENCE NO END OF BEING KNOWS
BEARING ITS SEAL IMMUTABLY IMPRESSD
WHATEVER THENCE IMMEDIATE FALLS IS FREE
FREE WHOLLY UNCONTROLLABLE BY POWER
OF EACH THING NEW BY SUCH CONFORMITY
MORE GRATEFUL TO ITS AUTHOR WHOSE BRIGHT BEAMS
THOUGH ALL PARTAKE THEIR SHINING YET IN THOSE
ARE LIVELIEST WHICH RESEMBLE HIM THE MOST
THESE TOKENS OF PREEMINENCE ON MAN
LARGELY BESTOWD IF ANY OF THEM FAIL
HE NEEDS MUST FORFEIT HIS NOBILITY
NO LONGER STAINLESS  SIN ALONE IS THAT
WHICH DOTH DISFRANCHISE HIM AND MAKE UNLIKE
TO THE CHIEF GOOD FOR THAT ITS LIGHT IN HIM
IS DARKEND  AND TO DIGNITY THUS LOST
IS NO RETURN UNLESS WHERE GUILT MAKES VOID
HE FOR ILL PLEASURE PAY WITH EQUAL PAIN
YOUR NATURE WHICH ENTIRELY IN ITS SEED
TRANGRESSD FROM THESE DISTINCTIONS FELL NO LESS
THAN FROM ITS STATE IN PARADISE NOR MEANS
FOUND OF RECOVERY SEARCH ALL METHODS OUT
AS STRICKLY AS THOU MAY SAVE ONE OF THESE
THE ONLY FORDS WERE LEFT THROUGH WHICH TO WADE
EITHER THAT GOD HAD OF HIS COURTESY
RELEASD HIM MERELY OR ELSE MAN HIMSELF
FOR HIS OWN FOLLY BY HIMSELF ATOND

FIX NOW THINE EYE INTENTLY AS THOU CANST
ON TH EVERLASTING COUNSEL AND EXPLORE
INSTRUCTED BY MY WORDS THE DREAD ABYSS

MAN IN HIMSELF HAD EVER LACKD THE MEANS
OF SATISFACTION FOR HE COULD NOT STOOP
OBEYING IN HUMILITY SO LOW
AS HIGH HE DISOBEYING THOUGHT TO SOAR
AND FOR THIS REASON HE HAD VAINLY TRIED
OUT OF HIS OWN SUFFICIENCY TO PAY
THE RIGID SATISFACTION  THEN BEHOOVED
THAT GOD SHOULD BY HIS OWN WAYS LEAD HIM BACK
UNTO THE LIFE FROM WHENCE HE FELL RESTORD
BY BOTH HIS WAYS I MEAN OR ONE ALONE
BUT SINCE THE DEED IS EVER PRIZD THE MORE
THE MORE THE DOERS GOOD INTENT APPEARS
GOODNESS CELESTIAL WHOSE BROAD SIGNATURE
IS ON THE UNIVERSE OF ALL ITS WAYS
TO RAISE YE UP WAS FAIN TO LEAVE OUT NONE
NOR AUGHT SO VAST OR SO MAGNIFICENT
EITHER FOR HIM WHO GAVE OR WHO RECEIVD
BETWEEN THE LAST NIGHT AND THE PRIMAL DAY
WAS OR CAN BE  FOR GOD MORE BOUNTY SHOWD
GIVING HIMSELF TO MAKE MAN CAPABLE
OF HIS RETURN TO LIFE THAN HAD THE TERMS
BEEN MERE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE
AND FOR HIS JUSTICE EVERY METHOD ELSE
WERE ALL TOO SCANT HAD NOT THE SON OF GOD
HUMBLED HIMSELF TO PUT ON MORTAL FLESH

NOW TO FULFIL EACH WISH OF THINE REMAINS
I SOMEWHAT FURTHER TO THY VIEW UNFOLD
THAT THOU MAYST SEE AS CLEARLY AS MYSELF

I SEE THOU SAYST THE AIR THE FIRE I SEE
THE EARTH AND WATER AND ALL THINGS OF THEM
COMPOUNDED TO CORRUPTION TURN AND SOON
DISSOLVE  YET THESE WERE ALSO THINGS CREATE
BECAUSE IF WHAT WERE TOLD ME HAD BEEN TRUE
THEY FROM CORRUPTION HAD BEEN THEREFORE FREE

THE ANGELS O MY BROTHER AND THIS CLIME
WHEREIN THOU ART IMPASSIBLE AND PURE
I CALL CREATED AS INDEED THEY ARE
IN THEIR WHOLE BEING  BUT THE ELEMENTS
WHICH THOU HAST NAMD AND WHAT OF THEM IS MADE
ARE BY CREATED VIRTUE INFORMD CREATE
THEIR SUBSTANCE AND CREATE THE INFORMING VIRTUE
IN THESE BRIGHT STARS THAT ROUND THEM CIRCLING MOVE
THE SOUL OF EVERY BRUTE AND OF EACH PLANT
THE RAY AND MOTION OF THE SACRED LIGHTS
WITH COMPLEX POTENCY ATTRACT AND TURN
BUT THIS OUR LIFE THE ETERNAL GOOD INSPIRES
IMMEDIATE AND ENAMOURS OF ITSELF
SO THAT OUR WISHES REST FOR EVER HERE

AND HENCE THOU MAYST BY INFERENCE CONCLUDE
OUR RESURRECTION CERTAIN IF THY MIND
CONSIDER HOW THE HUMAN FLESH WAS FRAMD
WHEN BOTH OUR PARENTS AT THE FIRST WERE MADE




CANTO VIII

THE WORLD WAS IN ITS DAY OF PERIL DARK
WONT TO BELIEVE THE DOTAGE OF FOND LOVE
FROM THE FAIR CYPRIAN DEITY WHO ROLLS
IN HER THIRD EPICYCLE SHED ON MEN
BY STREAM OF POTENT RADIANCE THEREFORE THEY

I WAS NOT WARE THAT I WAS WAFTED UP
INTO  ITS ORB BUT THE NEW LOVELINESS
THAT GRACD MY LADY GAVE ME AMPLE PROOF
THAT WE HAD ENTERED THERE  AND AS IN FLAME
A SPARKLE IS DISTINCT OR VOICE IN VOICE
DISCERND WHEN ONE ITS EVEN TENOUR KEEPS
THE OTHER COMES AND GOES SO IN THAT LIGHT
I OTHER LUMINARIES SAW THAT COURSD
IN CIRCLING MOTION RAPID MORE OR LESS
AS THEIR ETERNAL PHASES EACH IMPELS

NEVER WAS BLAST FROM VAPOUR CHARGED WITH COLD
WHETHER INVISIBLE TO EYE OR NO
DESCENDED WITH SUCH SPEED IT HAD NOT SEEMD
TO LINGER IN DULL TARDINESS COMPARD
TO THOSE CELESTIAL LIGHTS THAT TOWRDS US CAME
LEAVING THE CIRCUIT OF THEIR JOYOUS RING
CONDUCTED BY THE LOFTY SERAPHIM
AND AFTER THEM WHO IN THE VAN APPEARD
SUCH AN HOSANNA SOUNDED AS HATH LEFT
DESIRE NEER SINCE EXTINCT IN ME TO HEAR
RENEWD THE STRAIN  THEN PARTING FROM THE REST
ONE NEAR US DREW AND SOLE BEGAN WE ALL
ARE READY AT THY PLEASURE WELL DISPOSD
TO DO THEE GENTLE SERVICE  WE ARE THEY

O YE WHOSE INTELLECTUAL MINISTRY
MOVES THE THIRD HEAVEN AND IN ONE ORB WE ROLL
ONE MOTION ONE IMPULSE WITH THOSE WHO RULE
PRINCEDOMS IN HEAVEN YET ARE OF LOVE SO FULL
THAT TO PLEASE THEE T WILL BE AS SWEET TO REST

AFTER MINE EYES HAD WITH MEEK REVERENCE
SOUGHT THE CELESTIAL GUIDE AND WERE BY HER
ASSURD THEY TURND AGAIN UNTO THE LIGHT
WHO HAD SO LARGELY PROMISD AND WITH VOICE
THAT BARE THE LIVELY PRESSURE OF MY ZEAL

AND THUS IT ANSWERD A SHORT DATE BELOW
THE WORLD POSSESSD ME  HAD THE TIME BEEN MORE
MUCH EVIL THAT WILL COME HAD NEVER CHANCD
MY GLADNESS HIDES THEE FROM ME WHICH DOTH SHINE

IN ITS OWN SILK UNSWATHD  THOU LOVDST ME WELL
AND HADST GOOD CAUSE FOR HAD MY SOJOURNING
BEEN LONGER ON THE EARTH THE LOVE I BARE THEE

FROM WHERE THE TRENTO DISEMBOGUES HIS WAVES
WITH VERDE MINGLED TO THE SALT SEAFLOOD
ALREADY ON MY TEMPLES BEAMD THE CROWN
WHICH GAVE ME SOVREIGNTY OVER THE LAND
BY DANUBE WASHD WHENAS HE STRAYS BEYOND
THE LIMITS OF HIS GERMAN SHORES  THE REALM
WHERE ON THE GULF BY STORMY EURUS LASHD
BETWIXT PELORUS AND PACHYNIAN HEIGHTS
THE BEAUTIFUL TRINACRIA LIES IN GLOOM
NOT THROUGH TYPHAEUS BUT THE VAPRY CLOUD
BITUMINOUS UPSTEAMD THAT TOO DID LOOK
TO HAVE ITS SCEPTER WIELDED BY A RACE
OF MONARCHS SPRUNG THROUGH ME FROM CHARLES AND RODOLPH
HAD NOT ILL LORDING WHICH DOTH SPIRIT UP

HE HAD BEEN WARIER THAT THE GREEDY WANT
OF CATALONIA MIGHT NOT WORK HIS BALE
AND TRULY NEED THERE IS THAT HE FORECAST
OR OTHER FOR HIM LEST MORE FREIGHT BE LAID
ON HIS ALREADY OVERLADEN BARK
NATURE IN HIM FROM BOUNTY FALLN TO THRIFT
WOULD ASK THE  GUARD OF BRAVER ARMS THAN SUCH

MY LIEGE IT DOTH ENHANCE THE JOY THY WORDS
INFUSE INTO ME MIGHTY AS IT IS

IF TH INTELLECTUAL POWERS THAT MOVE THESE STARS

YEA ANSWERD I NOR HERE A REASON NEEDS

CONSULT YOUR TEACHER AND HE TELLS YOU NO

THUS DID HE COME DEDUCING TO THIS POINT
AND THEN CONCLUDED FOR THIS CAUSE BEHOOVES
THE ROOTS FROM WHENCE YOUR OPERATIONS COME
MUST DIFFER  THEREFORE ONE IS SOLON BORN
ANOTHER XERXES AND MELCHISIDEC
A THIRD AND HE A FOURTH WHOSE AIRY VOYAGE

THEREFORE YOUR STEPS HAVE WANDERD FROM THE PATHS

SHE ENDED AND APPEARD ON OTHER THOUGHTS
INTENT REENTRING ON THE WHEEL SHE LATE
HAD LEFT  THAT OTHER JOYANCE MEANWHILE WAXD
A THING TO MARVEL AT IN SPLENDOUR GLOWING
LIKE CHOICEST RUBY STRICKEN BY THE SUN
FOR IN THAT UPPER CLIME EFFULGENCE COMES
OF GLADNESS AS HERE LAUGHTER AND BELOW
AS THE MIND SADDENS MURKIER GROWS THE SHADE

GOD SEETH ALL AND IN HIM IS THY SIGHT
SAID I BLEST SPIRIT  THEREFORE WILL OF HIS

HE FORTHWITH ANSWRING THUS HIS WORDS BEGAN
THE VALLEY OF WATERS WIDEST NEXT TO THAT

BETWEEN DISCORDANT SHORES AGAINST THE SUN
INWARD SO FAR IT MAKES MERIDIAN THERE
WHERE WAS BEFORE TH HORIZON  OF THAT VALE
DWELT I UPON THE SHORE TWIXT EBROS STREAM
AND MACRAS THAT DIVIDES WITH PASSAGE BRIEF
GENOAN BOUNDS FROM TUSCAN  EAST AND WEST
ARE NEARLY ONE TO BEGGA AND MY LAND
WHOSE HAVEN ERST WAS WITH ITS OWN BLOOD WARM
WHO KNEW MY NAME WERE WONT TO CALL ME FOLCO
AND I DID BEAR IMPRESSION OF THIS HEAVN
THAT NOW BEARS MINE FOR NOT WITH FIERCER FLAME
GLOWD BELUS DAUGHTER INJURING ALIKE
SICHAEUS AND CREUSA THAN DID I
LONG AS IT SUITED THE UNRIPEND DOWN
THAT FLEDGD MY CHEEK NOR SHE OF RHODOPE
THAT WAS BEGUILED OF DEMOPHOON
NOR JOVES SON WHEN THE CHARMS OF IOLE
WERE SHRIND WITHIN HIS HEART  AND YET THERE HIDES
NO SORROWFUL REPENTANCE HERE BUT MIRTH
NOT FOR THE FAULT THAT DOTH NOT COME TO MIND
BUT FOR THE VIRTUE WHOSE OERRULING SWAY

THE SKILL IS LOOKD INTO THAT FASHIONETH
WITH SUCH EFFECTUAL WORKING AND THE GOOD

OF YOUR SUBLUNAR WORLD WAS TAKEN UP
FIRST IN CHRISTS TRIUMPH OF ALL SOULS REDEEMD
FOR WELL BEHOOVD THAT IN SOME PART OF HEAVN
SHE SHOULD REMAIN A TROPHY TO DECLARE
THE MIGHTY CONTEST WON WITH EITHER PALM
FOR THAT SHE FAVOURD FIRST THE HIGH EXPLOIT
OF JOSHUA ON THE HOLY LAND WHEREOF
THE POPE RECKS LITTLE NOW  THY CITY PLANT
OF HIM THAT ON HIS MAKER TURND THE BACK
AND OF WHOSE ENVYING SO MUCH WOE HATH SPRUNG
ENGENDERS AND EXPANDS THE CURSED FLOWER
THAT HATH MADE WANDER BOTH THE SHEEP AND LAMBS
TURNING THE SHEPHERD TO A WOLF  FOR THIS
THE GOSPEL AND GREAT TEACHERS LAID ASIDE
THE DECRETALS AS THEIR STUFT MARGINS SHOW

INTENT ON THESE NEER JOURNEY BUT IN THOUGHT
TO NAZARETH WHERE GABRIEL OPD HIS WINGS
YET IT MAY CHANCE ERELONG THE VATICAN
AND OTHER MOST SELECTED PARTS OF ROME
THAT WERE THE GRAVE OF PETERS SOLDIERY
SHALL BE DELIVERD FROM THE ADULTROUS BOND

BRANCHETH THE CIRCLE WHERE THE PLANETS ROLL
TO POUR THEIR WISHED INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD
WHOSE PATH NOT BENDING THUS IN HEAVN ABOVE

NOW REST THEE READER ON THY BENCH AND MUSE
ANTICIPATIVE OF THE FEAST TO COME
SO SHALL DELIGHT MAKE THEE NOT FEEL THY TOIL
LO I HAVE SET BEFORE THEE FOR THYSELF
FEED NOW THE MATTER I INDITE HENCEFORTH
DEMANDS ENTIRE MY THOUGHT  JOIND WITH THE PART
WHICH LATE WE TOLD OF THE GREAT MINISTER
OF NATURE THAT UPON THE WORLD IMPRINTS
THE VIRTUE OF THE HEAVEN AND DOLES OUT
TIME FOR US WITH HIS BEAM WENT CIRCLING ON
ALONG THE SPIRES WHERE EACH HOUR SOONER COMES
AND I WAS WITH HIM WEETLESS OF ASCENT
AS ONE WHO TILL ARRIVD WEETS NOT HIS COMING

FOR BEATRICE SHE WHO PASSETH ON
SO SUDDENLY FROM GOOD TO BETTER TIME
COUNTS NOT THE ACT OH THEN HOW GREAT MUST NEEDS
HAVE BEEN HER BRIGHTNESS  WHAT SHE WAS I TH SUN
WHERE I HAD ENTERD NOT THROUGH CHANGE OF HUE
BUT LIGHT TRANSPARENTDID I SUMMON UP
GENIUS ART PRACTICEI MIGHT NOT SO SPEAK
IT SHOULD BE EER IMAGIND YET BELIEVD
IT MAY BE AND THE SIGHT BE JUSTLY CRAVD
AND IF OUR FANTASY FAIL OF SUCH HEIGHT
WHAT MARVEL SINCE NO EYE ABOVE THE SUN
HATH EVER TRAVELD  SUCH ARE THEY DWELL HERE
FOURTH FAMILY OF THE OMNIPOTENT SIRE
WHO OF HIS SPIRIT AND OF HIS OFFSPRING SHOWS
AND HOLDS THEM STILL ENRAPTURD WITH THE VIEW
AND THUS TO ME BEATRICE THANK OH THANK
THE SUN OF ANGELS HIM WHO BY HIS GRACE
TO THIS PERCEPTIBLE HATH LIFTED THEE

NEVER WAS HEART IN SUCH DEVOTION BOUND
AND WITH COMPLACENCY SO ABSOLUTE
DISPOSD TO RENDER UP ITSELF TO GOD
AS MINE WAS AT THOSE WORDS AND SO ENTIRE
THE LOVE FOR HIM THAT HELD ME IT ECLIPSD
BEATRICE IN OBLIVION  NAUGHT DISPLEASD
WAS SHE BUT SMILD THEREAT SO JOYOUSLY
THAT OF HER LAUGHING EYES THE RADIANCE BRAKE
AND SCATTERD MY COLLECTED MIND ABROAD

THEN SAW I A BRIGHT BAND IN LIVELINESS
SURPASSING WHO THEMSELVES DID MAKE THE CROWN
AND US THEIR CENTRE YET MORE SWEET IN VOICE
THAN IN THEIR VISAGE BEAMING  CINCTURD THUS
SOMETIME LATONAS DAUGHTER WE BEHOLD
WHEN THE IMPREGNATE AIR RETAINS THE THREAD
THAT WEAVES HER ZONE  IN THE CELESTIAL COURT
WHENCE I RETURN ARE MANY JEWELS FOUND
SO DEAR AND BEAUTIFUL THEY CANNOT BROOK
TRANSPORTING FROM THAT REALM AND OF THESE LIGHTS
SUCH WAS THE SONG  WHO DOTH NOT PRUNE HIS WING
TO SOAR UP THITHER LET HIM LOOK FROM THENCE
FOR TIDINGS FROM THE DUMB  WHEN SINGING THUS
THOSE BURNING SUNS THAT CIRCLED ROUND US THRICE
AS NEAREST STARS AROUND THE FIXED POLE
THEN SEEMD THEY LIKE TO LADIES FROM THE DANCE
NOT CEASING BUT SUSPENSE IN SILENT PAUSE
LISTNING TILL THEY HAVE CAUGHT THE STRAIN ANEW
SUSPENDED SO THEY STOOD AND FROM WITHIN
THUS HEARD I ONE WHO SPAKE SINCE WITH ITS BEAM
THE GRACE WHENCE TRUE LOVE LIGHTETH FIRST HIS FLAME
THAT AFTER DOTH INCREASE BY LOVING SHINES
SO MULTIPLIED IN THEE IT LEADS THEE UP
ALONG THIS LADDER DOWN WHOSE HALLOWD STEPS
NONE EER DESCEND AND MOUNT THEM NOT AGAIN
WHO FROM HIS PHIAL SHOULD REFUSE THEE WINE
TO SLAKE THY THIRST NO LESS CONSTRAINED WERE
THAN WATER FLOWING NOT UNTO THE SEA
THOU FAIN WOULDST HEAR WHAT PLANTS ARE THESE THAT BLOOM
IN THE BRIGHT GARLAND WHICH ADMIRING GIRDS
THIS FAIR DAME ROUND WHO STRENGTHENS THEE FOR HEAVN
I THEN WAS OF THE LAMBS THAT DOMINIC
LEADS FOR HIS SAINTLY FLOCK ALONG THE WAY
WHERE WELL THEY THRIVE NOT SWORN WITH VANITY
HE NEAREST ON MY RIGHT HAND BROTHER WAS
AND MASTER TO ME ALBERT OF COLOGNE
IS THIS AND OF AQUINUM THOMAS I
IF THOU OF ALL THE REST WOULDST BE ASSURD
LET THINE EYE WAITING ON THE WORDS I SPEAK
IN CIRCUIT JOURNEY ROUND THE BLESSED WREATH
THAT NEXT RESPLENDENCE ISSUES FROM THE SMILE
OF GRATIAN WHO TO EITHER FORUM LENT
SUCH HELP AS FAVOUR WINS IN PARADISE
THE OTHER NEAREST WHO ADORNS OUR QUIRE
WAS PETER HE THAT WITH THE WIDOW GAVE
TO HOLY CHURCH HIS TREASURE  THE FIFTH LIGHT
GOODLIEST OF ALL IS BY SUCH LOVE INSPIRED
THAT ALL YOUR WORLD CRAVES TIDINGS OF ITS DOOM
WITHIN THERE IS THE LOFTY LIGHT ENDOWD
WITH SAPIENCE SO PROFOUND IF TRUTH BE TRUTH
THAT WITH A KEN OF SUCH WIDE AMPLITUDE
NO SECOND HATH ARISEN  NEXT BEHOLD
THAT TAPERS RADIANCE TO WHOSE VIEW WAS SHOWN
CLEARLIEST THE NATURE AND THE MINISTRY
ANGELICAL WHILE YET IN FLESH IT DWELT
IN THE OTHER LITTLE LIGHT SERENELY SMILES
THAT PLEADER FOR THE CHRISTIAN TEMPLES HE
WHO DID PROVIDE AUGUSTIN OF HIS LORE
NOW IF THY MINDS EYE PASS FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
UPON MY PRAISES FOLLOWING OF THE EIGHTH
THY THIRST IS NEXT  THE SAINTLY SOUL THAT SHOWS
THE WORLDS DECEITFULNESS TO ALL WHO HEAR HIM
IS WITH THE SIGHT OF ALL THE GOOD THAT IS
BLEST THERE  THE LIMBS WHENCE IT WAS DRIVEN LIE
DOWN IN CIELDAURO AND FROM MARTYRDOM
AND EXILE CAME IT HERE  LO FURTHER ON
WHERE FLAMES THE ARDUOUS SPIRIT OF ISIDORE
OF BEDE AND RICHARD MORE THAN MAN EREWHILE
IN DEEP DISCERNMENT  LASTLY THIS FROM WHOM
THY LOOK ON ME REVERTETH WAS THE BEAM
OF ONE WHOSE SPIRIT ON HIGH MUSINGS BENT
REBUKD THE LINGRING TARDINESS OF DEATH
IT IS THE ETERNAL LIGHT OF SIGEBERT
WHO SCAPD NOT ENVY WHEN OF TRUTH HE ARGUED
READING IN THE STRAWLITTERD STREET  FORTHWITH
AS CLOCK THAT CALLETH UP THE SPOUSE OF GOD
TO WIN HER BRIDEGROOMS LOVE AT MATINS HOUR
EACH PART OF OTHER FITLY DRAWN AND URGD
SENDS OUT A TINKLING SOUND OF NOTE SO SWEET
AFFECTION SPRINGS IN WELLDISPOSED BREAST
THUS SAW I MOVE THE GLORIOUS WHEEL THUS HEARD
VOICE ANSWRING VOICE SO MUSICAL AND SOFT
IT CAN BE KNOWN BUT WHERE DAY ENDLESS SHINES




CANTO XI

O FOND ANXIETY OF MORTAL MEN
HOW VAIN AND INCONCLUSIVE ARGUMENTS
ARE THOSE WHICH MAKE THEE BEAT THY WINGS BELOW
FOR STATUES ONE AND ONE FOR APHORISMS
WAS HUNTING THIS THE PRIESTHOOD FOLLOWD THAT
BY FORCE OR SOPHISTRY ASPIRD TO RULE
TO ROB ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SOUGHT
BY CIVIL BUSINESS WEALTH ONE MOILING LAY
TANGLED IN NET OF SENSUAL DELIGHT
AND ONE TO WITLESS INDOLENCE RESIGND
WHAT TIME FROM ALL THESE EMPTY THINGS ESCAPD
WITH BEATRICE I THUS GLORIOUSLY
WAS RAISD ALOFT AND MADE THE GUEST OF HEAVN

THEY OF THE CIRCLE TO THAT POINT EACH ONE
WHERE ERST IT WAS HAD TURND AND STEADY GLOWD
AS CANDLE IN HIS SOCKET  THEN WITHIN
THE LUSTRE THAT EREWHILE BESPAKE ME SMILING
WITH MERER GLADNESS HEARD I THUS BEGIN

EEN AS HIS BEAM ILLUMES ME SO I LOOK
INTO THE ETERNAL LIGHT AND CLEARLY MARK
THY THOUGHTS FROM WHENCE THEY RISE  THOU ART IN DOUBT
AND WOULDST THAT I SHOULD BOLT MY WORDS AFRESH
IN SUCH PLAIN OPEN PHRASE AS MAY BE SMOOTH
TO THY PERCEPTION WHERE I TOLD THEE LATE
THAT WELL THEY THRIVE AND THAT NO SECOND SUCH
HATH RISEN WHICH NO SMALL DISTINCTION NEEDS

THE PROVIDENCE THAT GOVERNETH THE WORLD
IN DEPTH OF COUNSEL BY CREATED KEN
UNFATHOMABLE TO THE END THAT SHE
WHO WITH LOUD CRIES WAS SPOUSD IN PRECIOUS BLOOD
MIGHT KEEP HER FOOTING TOWARDS HER WELLBELOVD
SAFE IN HERSELF AND CONSTANT UNTO HIM
HATH TWO ORDAIND WHO SHOULD ON EITHER HAND
IN CHIEF ESCORT HER ONE SERAPHIC ALL
IN FERVENCY FOR WISDOM UPON EARTH
THE OTHER SPLENDOUR OF CHERUBIC LIGHT
I BUT OF ONE WILL TELL HE TELLS OF BOTH
WHO ONE COMMENDETH WHICH OF THEM SOER
BE TAKEN FOR THEIR DEEDS WERE TO ONE END

BETWEEN TUPINO AND THE WAVE THAT FALLS
FROM BLEST UBALDOS CHOSEN HILL THERE HANGS
RICH SLOPE OF MOUNTAIN HIGH WHENCE HEAT AND COLD
ARE WAFTED THROUGH PERUGIAS EASTERN GATE
AND NORCERA WITH GUALDO IN ITS REAR
MOURN FOR THEIR HEAVY YOKE  UPON THAT SIDE
WHERE IT DOTH BREAK ITS STEEPNESS MOST AROSE
A SUN UPON THE WORLD AS DULY THIS
FROM GANGES DOTH THEREFORE LET NONE WHO SPEAK
OF THAT PLACE SAY ASCESI FOR ITS NAME
WERE LAMELY SO DELIVERD BUT THE EAST
TO CALL THINGS RIGHTLY BE IT HENCEFORTH STYLD
HE WAS NOT YET MUCH DISTANT FROM HIS RISING
WHEN HIS GOOD INFLUENCE GAN TO BLESS THE EARTH
A DAME TO WHOM NONE OPENETH PLEASURES GATE
MORE THAN TO DEATH WAS GAINST HIS FATHERS WILL
HIS STRIPLING CHOICE AND HE DID MAKE HER HIS
BEFORE THE SPIRITUAL COURT BY NUPTIAL BONDS
AND IN HIS FATHERS SIGHT FROM DAY TO DAY
THEN LOVD HER MORE DEVOUTLY  SHE BEREAVD
OF HER FIRST HUSBAND SLIGHTED AND OBSCURE
THOUSAND AND HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE REMAIND
WITHOUT A SINGLE SUITOR TILL HE CAME
NOR AUGHT AVAILD THAT WITH AMYCLAS SHE
WAS FOUND UNMOVD AT RUMOUR OF HIS VOICE
WHO SHOOK THE WORLD NOR AUGHT HER CONSTANT BOLDNESS
WHEREBY WITH CHRIST SHE MOUNTED ON THE CROSS
WHEN MARY STAYD BENEATH  BUT NOT TO DEAL
THUS CLOSELY WITH THEE LONGER TAKE AT LARGE
THE ROVERS TITLESPOVERTY AND FRANCIS
THEIR CONCORD AND GLAD LOOKS WONDER AND LOVE
AND SWEET REGARD GAVE BIRTH TO HOLY THOUGHTS
SO MUCH THAT VENERABLE BERNARD FIRST
DID BARE HIS FEET AND IN PURSUIT OF PEACE
SO HEAVENLY RAN YET DEEMD HIS FOOTING SLOW
O HIDDEN RICHES  O PROLIFIC GOOD
EGIDIUS BARES HIM NEXT AND NEXT SYLVESTER
AND FOLLOW BOTH THE BRIDEGROOM SO THE BRIDE
CAN PLEASE THEM  THENCEFORTH GOES HE ON HIS WAY
THE FATHER AND THE MASTER WITH HIS SPOUSE
AND WITH THAT FAMILY WHOM NOW THE CORD
GIRT HUMBLY NOR DID ABJECTNESS OF HEART
WEIGH DOWN HIS EYELIDS FOR THAT HE WAS SON
OF PIETRO BERNARDONE AND BY MEN
IN WONDROUS SORT DESPISD  BUT ROYALLY
HIS HARD INTENTION HE TO INNOCENT
SET FORTH AND FROM HIM FIRST RECEIVD THE SEAL
ON HIS RELIGION  THEN WHEN NUMEROUS FLOCKD
THE TRIBE OF LOWLY ONES THAT TRACD HIS STEPS
WHOSE MARVELLOUS LIFE DESERVEDLY WERE SUNG
IN HEIGHTS EMPYREAL THROUGH HONORIUS HAND
A SECOND CROWN TO DECK THEIR GUARDIANS VIRTUES
WAS BY THE ETERNAL SPIRIT INWREATHD AND WHEN
HE HAD THROUGH THIRST OF MARTYRDOM STOOD UP
IN THE PROUD SOLDANS PRESENCE AND THERE PREACHD
CHRIST AND HIS FOLLOWERS BUT FOUND THE RACE
UNRIPEND FOR CONVERSION BACK ONCE MORE
HE HASTED NOT TO INTERMIT HIS TOIL
AND REAPD AUSONIAN LANDS  ON THE HARD ROCK
TWIXT ARNO AND THE TYBER HE FROM CHRIST
TOOK THE LAST SIGNET WHICH HIS LIMBS TWO YEARS
DID CARRY  THEN THE SEASON COME THAT HE
WHO TO SUCH GOOD HAD DESTIND HIM WAS PLEASD
T ADVANCE HIM TO THE MEED WHICH HE HAD EARND
BY HIS SELFHUMBLING TO HIS BROTHERHOOD
AS THEIR JUST HERITAGE HE GAVE IN CHARGE
HIS DEAREST LADY AND ENJOIND THEIR LOVE
AND FAITH TO HER AND FROM HER BOSOM WILLD
HIS GOODLY SPIRIT SHOULD MOVE FORTH RETURNING
TO ITS APPOINTED KINGDOM NOR WOULD HAVE
HIS BODY LAID UPON ANOTHER BIER

THINK NOW OF ONE WHO WERE A FIT COLLEAGUE
TO KEEP THE BARK OF PETER IN DEEP SEA
HELMD TO RIGHT POINT AND SUCH OUR PATRIARCH WAS
THEREFORE WHO FOLLOW HIM AS HE ENJOINS
THOU MAYST BE CERTAIN TAKE GOOD LADING IN
BUT HUNGER OF NEW VIANDS TEMPTS HIS FLOCK
SO THAT THEY NEEDS INTO STRANGE PASTURES WIDE
MUST SPREAD THEM AND THE MORE REMOTE FROM HIM
THE STRAGGLERS WANDER SO MUCH MOLE THEY COME
HOME TO THE SHEEPFOLD DESTITUTE OF MILK
THERE ARE OF THEM IN TRUTH WHO FEAR THEIR HARM
AND TO THE SHEPHERD CLEAVE BUT THESE SO FEW
A LITTLE STUFF MAY FURNISH OUT THEIR CLOAKS

NOW IF MY WORDS BE CLEAR IF THOU HAVE TAEN
GOOD HEED IF THAT WHICH I HAVE TOLD RECALL
TO MIND THY WISH MAY BE IN PART FULFILLD
FOR THOU WILT SEE THE POINT FROM WHENCE THEY SPLIT
NOR MISS OF THE REPROOF WHICH THAT IMPLIES
THAT WELL THEY THRIVE NOT SWORN WITH VANITY




CANTO XII

SOON AS ITS FINAL WORD THE BLESSED FLAME
HAD RAISD FOR UTTERANCE STRAIGHT THE HOLY MILL
BEGAN TO WHEEL NOR YET HAD ONCE REVOLVD
OR ERE ANOTHER CIRCLING COMPASSD IT
MOTION TO MOTION SONG TO SONG CONJOINING
SONG THAT AS MUCH OUR MUSES DOTH EXCEL
OUR SIRENS WITH THEIR TUNEFUL PIPES AS RAY
OF PRIMAL SPLENDOUR DOTH ITS FAINT REFLEX

AS WHEN IF JUNO BID HER HANDMAID FORTH
TWO ARCHES PARALLEL AND TRICKD ALIKE
SPAN THE THIN CLOUD THE OUTER TAKING BIRTH
FROM THAT WITHIN IN MANNER OF THAT VOICE
WHOM LOVE DID MELT AWAY AS SUN THE MIST
AND THEY WHO GAZE PRESAGEFUL CALL TO MIND
THE COMPACT MADE WITH NOAH OF THE WORLD
NO MORE TO BE OERFLOWD ABOUT US THUS
OF SEMPITERNAL ROSES BENDING WREATHD
THOSE GARLANDS TWAIN AND TO THE INNERMOST
EEN THUS TH EXTERNAL ANSWERED  WHEN THE FOOTING
AND OTHER GREAT FESTIVITY OF SONG
AND RADIANCE LIGHT WITH LIGHT ACCORDANT EACH
JOCUND AND BLYTHE HAD AT THEIR PLEASURE STILLD
EEN AS THE EYES BY QUICK VOLITION MOVD
ARE SHUT AND RAISD TOGETHER FROM THE HEART
OF ONE AMONGST THE NEW LIGHTS MOVD A VOICE
THAT MADE ME SEEM LIKE NEEDLE TO THE STAR
IN TURNING TO ITS WHEREABOUT AND THUS
BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME BEAUTIFUL
PROMPTS ME TO TELL OF TH OTHER GUIDE FOR WHOM
SUCH GOOD OF MINE IS SPOKEN  WHERE ONE IS
THE OTHER WORTHILY SHOULD ALSO BE
THAT AS THEIR WARFARE WAS ALIKE ALIKE
SHOULD BE THEIR GLORY  SLOW AND FULL OF DOUBT
AND WITH THIN RANKS AFTER ITS BANNER MOVD
THE ARMY OF CHRIST WHICH IT SO CLEARLY COST
TO REAPPOINT WHEN ITS IMPERIAL HEAD
WHO REIGNETH EVER FOR THE DROOPING HOST
DID MAKE PROVISION THOROUGH GRACE ALONE
AND NOT THROUGH ITS DESERVING  AS THOU HEARDST
TWO CHAMPIONS TO THE SUCCOUR OF HIS SPOUSE
HE SENT WHO BY THEIR DEEDS AND WORDS MIGHT JOIN
AGAIN HIS SCATTERD PEOPLE  IN THAT CLIME
WHERE SPRINGS THE PLEASANT WESTWIND TO UNFOLD
THE FRESH LEAVES WITH WHICH EUROPE SEES HERSELF
NEWGARMENTED NOR FROM THOSE BILLOWS FAR
BEYOND WHOSE CHIDING AFTER WEARY COURSE
THE SUN DOTH SOMETIMES HIDE HIM SAFE ABIDES
THE HAPPY CALLAROGA UNDER GUARD
OF THE GREAT SHIELD WHEREIN THE LION LIES
SUBJECTED AND SUPREME  AND THERE WAS BORN
THE LOVING MILLION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
THE HOLLOWD WRESTLER GENTLE TO HIS OWN
AND TO HIS ENEMIES TERRIBLE  SO REPLETE
HIS SOUL WITH LIVELY VIRTUE THAT WHEN FIRST
CREATED EVEN IN THE MOTHERS WOMB
IT PROPHESIED  WHEN AT THE SACRED FONT
THE SPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE TWIXT FAITH AND HIM
WHERE PLEDGE OF MUTUAL SAFETY WAS EXCHANGD
THE DAME WHO WAS HIS SURETY IN HER SLEEP
BEHELD THE WONDROUS FRUIT THAT WAS FROM HIM
AND FROM HIS HEIRS TO ISSUE  AND THAT SUCH
HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS INDEED HE WAS
SHE WAS INSPIRD TO NAME HIM OF HIS OWNER
WHOSE HE WAS WHOLLY AND SO CALLD HIM DOMINIC
AND I SPEAK OF HIM AS THE LABOURER
WHOM CHRIST IN HIS OWN GARDEN CHOSE TO BE
HIS HELPMATE  MESSENGER HE SEEMD AND FRIEND
FASTKNIT TO CHRIST AND THE FIRST LOVE HE SHOWD
WAS AFTER THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT CHRIST GAVE
MANY A TIME HIS NURSE AT ENTERING FOUND
THAT HE HAD RISN IN SILENCE AND WAS PROSTRATE
AS WHO SHOULD SAY MY ERRAND WAS FOR THIS
O HAPPY FATHER  FELIX RIGHTLY NAMD
O FAVOURD MOTHER RIGHTLY NAMD JOANNA
IF THAT DO MEAN AS MEN INTERPRET IT
NOT FOR THE WORLDS SAKE FOR WHICH NOW THEY PORE
UPON OSTIENSE AND TADDEOS PAGE
BUT FOR THE REAL MANNA SOON HE GREW
MIGHTY IN LEARNING AND DID SET HIMSELF
TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD THAT SOON TURNS
TO WAN AND WITHERD IF NOT TENDED WELL
AND FROM THE SEE WHOSE BOUNTY TO THE JUST
AND NEEDY IS GONE BY NOT THROUGH ITS FAULT
BUT HIS WHO FILLS IT BASELY HE BESOUGHT
NO DISPENSATION FOR COMMUTED WRONG
NOR THE FIRST VACANT FORTUNE NOR THE TENTH
THAT TO GODS PAUPERS RIGHTLY APPERTAIN
BUT GAINST AN ERRING AND DEGENERATE WORLD
LICENCE TO FIGHT IN FAVOUR OF THAT SEED
FROM WHICH THE TWICE TWELVE CIONS GIRD THEE ROUND
THEN WITH SAGE DOCTRINE AND GOOD WILL TO HELP
FORTH ON HIS GREAT APOSTLESHIP HE FARD
LIKE TORRENT BURSTING FROM A LOFTY VEIN
AND DASHING GAINST THE STOCKS OF HERESY
SMOTE FIERCEST WHERE RESISTANCE WAS MOST STOUT
THENCE MANY RIVULETS HAVE SINCE BEEN TURND
OVER THE GARDEN CATHOLIC TO LEAD
THEIR LIVING WATERS AND HAVE FED ITS PLANTS

IF SUCH ONE WHEEL OF THAT TWOYOKED CAR
WHEREIN THE HOLY CHURCH DEFENDED HER
AND RODE TRIUMPHANT THROUGH THE CIVIL BROIL
THOU CANST NOT DOUBT ITS FELLOWS EXCELLENCE
WHICH THOMAS ERE MY COMING HATH DECLARD
SO COURTEOUSLY UNTO THEE  BUT THE TRACK
WHICH ITS SMOOTH FELLIES MADE IS NOW DESERTED
THAT MOULDY MOTHER IS WHERE LATE WERE LEES
HIS FAMILY THAT WONT TO TRACE HIS PATH
TURN BACKWARD AND INVERT THEIR STEPS ERELONG
TO RUE THE GATHERING IN OF THEIR ILL CROP
WHEN THE REJECTED TARES IN VAIN SHALL ASK
ADMITTANCE TO THE BARN  I QUESTION NOT
BUT HE WHO SEARCHD OUR VOLUME LEAF BY LEAF
MIGHT STILL FIND PAGE WITH THIS INSCRIPTION ONT

LET HIM WHO WOULD CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW
IMAGINE AND RETAIN THE IMAGE FIRM
AS MOUNTAIN ROCK THE WHILST HE HEARS ME SPEAK
OF STARS FIFTEEN FROM MIDST THE ETHEREAL HOST
SELECTED THAT WITH LIVELY RAY SERENE
OERCOME THE MASSIEST AIR THERETO IMAGINE
THE WAIN THAT IN THE BOSOM OF OUR SKY
SPINS EVER ON ITS AXLE NIGHT AND DAY
WITH THE BRIGHT SUMMIT OF THAT HORN WHICH SWELLS
DUE FROM THE POLE ROUND WHICH THE FIRST WHEEL ROLLS
T HAVE RANGD THEMSELVES IN FASHION OF TWO SIGNS
IN HEAVN SUCH AS ARIADNE MADE
WHEN DEATHS CHILL SEIZED HER AND THAT ONE OF THEM
DID COMPASS IN THE OTHERS BEAM AND BOTH
IN SUCH SORT WHIRL AROUND THAT EACH SHOULD TEND
WITH OPPOSITE MOTION AND CONCEIVING THUS
OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DANCE
TWOFOLD THAT CIRCLED ME HE SHALL ATTAIN
AS T WERE THE SHADOW FOR THINGS THERE AS MUCH
SURPASS OUR USAGE AS THE SWIFTEST HEAVN
IS SWIFTER THAN THE CHIANA  THERE WAS SUNG
NO BACCHUS AND NO IO PAEAN BUT
THREE PERSONS IN THE GODHEAD AND IN ONE
SUBSTANCE THAT NATURE AND THE HUMAN JOIND

THE SONG FULFILLD ITS MEASURE AND TO US
THOSE SAINTLY LIGHTS ATTENDED HAPPIER MADE
AT EACH NEW MINISTRING  THEN SILENCE BRAKE

OF THE MEEK MAN OF GOD WAS TOLD TO ME
AND THUS IT SPAKE ONE EAR O TH HARVEST THRESHD
AND ITS GRAIN SAFELY STORD SWEET CHARITY
INVITES ME WITH THE OTHER TO LIKE TOIL

THOU KNOWST THAT IN THE BOSOM WHENCE THE RIB
WAS TAEN TO FASHION THAT FAIR CHEEK WHOSE TASTE
ALL THE WORLD PAYS FOR AND IN THAT WHICH PIERCD
BY THE KEEN LANCE BOTH AFTER AND BEFORE
SUCH SATISFACTION OFFERD AS OUTWEIGHS
EACH EVIL IN THE SCALE WHATEER OF LIGHT
TO HUMAN NATURE IS ALLOWD MUST ALL
HAVE BY HIS VIRTUE BEEN INFUSD WHO FORMD
BOTH ONE AND OTHER AND THOU THENCE ADMIRST
IN THAT I TOLD THEE OF BEATITUDES
A SECOND THERE IS NONE TO HIS ENCLOSD
IN THE FIFTH RADIANCE  OPEN NOW THINE EYES
TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE
THY DEEMING AND MY SAYING MEET IN TRUTH
AS CENTRE IN THE ROUND  THAT WHICH DIES NOT
AND THAT WHICH CAN DIE ARE BUT EACH THE BEAM
OF THAT IDEA WHICH OUR SOVERIGN SIRE
ENGENDERETH LOVING FOR THAT LIVELY LIGHT
WHICH PASSETH FROM HIS BRIGHTNESS NOT DISJOIND
FROM HIM NOR FROM HIS LOVE TRIUNE WITH THEM
DOTH THROUGH HIS BOUNTY CONGREGATE ITSELF
MIRRORD AS T WERE IN NEW EXISTENCES
ITSELF UNALTERABLE AND EVER ONE

DESCENDING HENCE UNTO THE LOWEST POWERS
ITS ENERGY SO SINKS AT LAST IT MAKES
BUT BRIEF CONTINGENCIES FOR SO I NAME
THINGS GENERATED WHICH THE HEAVNLY ORBS
MOVING WITH SEED OR WITHOUT SEED PRODUCE
THEIR WAX AND THAT WHICH MOLDS IT DIFFER MUCH
AND THENCE WITH LUSTRE MORE OR LESS IT SHOWS
TH IDEAL STAMP IMPRESS SO THAT ONE TREE
ACCORDING TO HIS KIND HATH BETTER FRUIT
AND WORSE AND AT YOUR BIRTH YE MORTAL MEN
ARE IN YOUR TALENTS VARIOUS  WERE THE WAX
MOLDED WITH NICE EXACTNESS AND THE HEAVN
IN ITS DISPOSING INFLUENCE SUPREME
THE LUSTRE OF THE SEAL SHOULD BE COMPLETE
BUT NATURE RENDERS IT IMPERFECT EVER
RESEMBLING THUS THE ARTIST IN HER WORK
WHOSE FAULTERING HAND IS FAITHLESS TO HIS SKILL
HOWEER IF LOVE ITSELF DISPOSE AND MARK
THE PRIMAL VIRTUE KINDLING WITH BRIGHT VIEW
THERE ALL PERFECTION IS VOUCHSAFED AND SUCH
THE CLAY WAS MADE ACCOMPLISHD WITH EACH GIFT
THAT LIFE CAN TEEM WITH SUCH THE BURDEN FILLD
THE VIRGINS BOSOM SO THAT I COMMEND
THY JUDGMENT THAT THE HUMAN NATURE NEER
WAS OR CAN BE SUCH AS IN THEM IT WAS

DID I ADVANCE NO FURTHER THAN THIS POINT
HOW THEN HAD HE NO PEER  THOU MIGHTST REPLY
BUT THAT WHAT NOW APPEARS NOT MAY APPEAR
RIGHT PLAINLY PONDER WHO HE WAS AND WHAT
WHEN HE WAS BIDDEN ASK  THE MOTIVE SWAYD
TO HIS REQUESTING  I HAVE SPOKEN THUS
THAT THOU MAYST SEE HE WAS A KING WHO ASKD
FOR WISDOM TO THE END HE MIGHT BE KING
SUFFICIENT NOT THE NUMBER TO SEARCH OUT
OF THE CELESTIAL MOVERS OR TO KNOW
IF NECESSARY WITH CONTINGENT EER
HAVE MADE NECESSITY OR WHETHER THAT
BE GRANTED THAT FIRST MOTION IS OR IF
OF THE MID CIRCLE CAN BY ART BE MADE
TRIANGLE WITH EACH CORNER BLUNT OR SHARP

WHENCE NOTING THAT WHICH I HAVE SAID AND THIS
THOU KINGLY PRUDENCE AND THAT KEN MAYST LEARN
AT WHICH THE DART OF MY INTENTION AIMS
AND MARKING CLEARLY THAT I TOLD THEE RISEN
THOU SHALT DISCERN IT ONLY HATH RESPECT
TO KINGS OF WHOM ARE MANY AND THE GOOD
ARE RARE  WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE MY WORDS
AND THEY MAY WELL CONSIST WITH THAT WHICH THOU
OF THE FIRST HUMAN FATHER DOST BELIEVE
AND OF OUR WELLBELOVED  AND LET THIS
HENCEFORTH BE LED UNTO THY FEET TO MAKE
THEE SLOW IN MOTION AS A WEARY MAN
BOTH TO THE YEA AND TO THE NAY THOU SEEST NOT
FOR HE AMONG THE FOOLS IS DOWN FULL LOW
WHOSE AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL IS
WITHOUT DISTINCTION IN EACH CASE ALIKE
SINCE IT BEFALLS THAT IN MOST INSTANCES
CURRENT OPINION LEADS TO FALSE AND THEN
AFFECTION BENDS THE JUDGMENT TO HER PLY

MUCH MORE THAN VAINLY DOTH HE LOOSE FROM SHORE
SINCE HE RETURNS NOT SUCH AS HE SET FORTH
WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND WANTETH SKILL
AND OPEN PROOFS OF THIS UNTO THE WORLD
HAVE BEEN AFFORDED IN PARMENIDES
MELISSUS BRYSO AND THE CROWD BESIDE
WHO JOURNEYD ON AND KNEW NOT WHITHER SO DID
SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THE OTHER FOOLS
WHO LIKE TO SCYMITARS REFLECTED BACK
THE SCRIPTUREIMAGE BY DISTORTION MARRD

LET NOT THE PEOPLE BE TOO SWIFT TO JUDGE
AS ONE WHO RECKONS ON THE BLADES IN FIELD
OR ERE THE CROP BE RIPE  FOR I HAVE SEEN
THE THORN FROWN RUDELY ALL THE WINTER LONG
AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP
AND BARK THAT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SEA
RAN STRAIGHT AND SPEEDY PERISH AT THE LAST
EEN IN THE HAVENS MOUTH SEEING ONE STEAL
ANOTHER BRINE HIS OFFERING TO THE PRIEST
LET NOT DAME BIRTHA AND SIR MARTIN THENCE

FROM CENTRE TO THE CIRCLE AND SO BACK

AND BEATRICE AFTER HIM HER WORDS
RESUMD ALTERNATE NEED THERE IS THO YET
HE TELLS IT TO YOU NOT IN WORDS NOR EEN
IN THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD FATHOM TO ITS DEPTH
ANOTHER MYSTERY  TELL HIM IF THE LIGHT
WHEREWITH YOUR SUBSTANCE BLOOMS SHALL STAY WITH YOU
ETERNALLY AS NOW AND IF IT DOTH
HOW WHEN YE SHALL REGAIN YOUR VISIBLE FORMS
THE SIGHT MAY WITHOUT HARM ENDURE THE CHANGE
THAT ALSO TELL  AS THOSE WHO IN A RING
TREAD THE LIGHT MEASURE IN THEIR FITFUL MIRTH
RAISE LOUD THE VOICE AND SPRING WITH GLADDER BOUND

FOR HIGHEST MERIT WERE AN AMPLE MEED
AND FROM THE LESSER ORB THE GOODLIEST LIGHT
WITH GENTLE VOICE AND MILD SUCH AS PERHAPS
THE ANGELS ONCE TO MARY THUS REPLIED
LONG AS THE JOY OF PARADISE SHALL LAST
OUR LOVE SHALL SHINE AROUND THAT RAIMENT BRIGHT
AS FERVENT FERVENT AS IN VISION BLEST
AND THAT AS FAR IN BLESSEDNESS EXCEEDING

SHOW YET MORE GRACIOUS  THEREFORE SHALL INCREASE
WHATEER OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS IMPARTS
THE SUPREME GOOD LIGHT MINISTERING AID
THE BETTER DISCLOSE HIS GLORY WHENCE
THE VISION NEEDS INCREASING MUCH INCREASE
THE FERVOUR WHICH IT KINDLES AND THAT TOO
THE RAY THAT COMES FROM IT  BUT AS THE GREED
WHICH GIVES OUT FLAME YET IT ITS WHITENESS SHINES
MORE LIVELY THAN THAT AND SO PRESERVES
ITS PROPER SEMBLANCE THUS THIS CIRCLING SPHERE
OF SPLENDOUR SHALL TO VIEW LESS RADIANT SEEM
THAN SHALL OUR FLESHLY ROBE WHICH YONDER EARTH
NOW COVERS  NOR WILL SUCH EXCESS OF LIGHT
OERPOWER US IN CORPOREAL ORGANS MADE
FIRM AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF ALL DELIGHT

SO READY AND SO CORDIAL AN AMEN
FOLLOWED FROM EITHER CHOIR AS PLAINLY SPOKE
DESIRE OF THEIR DEAD BODIES YET PERCHANCE
NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR KINDRED DEAR
MOTHERS AND SIRES AND THOSE WHOM BEST THEY LOVD
ERE THEY WERE MADE IMPERISHABLE FLAME

AND LO FORTHWITH THERE ROSE UP ROUND ABOUT
A LUSTRE OVER THAT ALREADY THERE
OF EQUAL CLEARNESS LIKE THE BRIGHTENING UP
OF THE HORIZON  AS AT AN EVENING HOUR
OF TWILIGHT NEW APPEARANCES THROUGH HEAVN
PEER WITH FAINT GLIMMER DOUBTFULLY DESCRIED
SO THERE NEW SUBSTANCES METHOUGHT BEGAN
TO RISE IN VIEW AND ROUND THE OTHER TWAIN
ENWHEELING SWEEP THEIR AMPLER CIRCUIT WIDE

O GENTLE GLITTER OF ETERNAL BEAM
WITH WHAT A SUCH WHITENESS DID IT FLOW
OERPOWERING VISION IN ME  BUT SO FAIR
SO PASSING LOVELY BEATRICE SHOWD
MIND CANNOT FOLLOW IT NOR WORDS EXPRESS
HER INFINITE SWEETNESS  THENCE MINE EYES REGAIND
POWER TO LOOK UP AND I BEHELD MYSELF
SOLE WITH MY LADY TO MORE LOFTY BLISS
TRANSLATED FOR THE STAR WITH WARMER SMILE
IMPURPLED WELL DENOTED OUR ASCENT

WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH THAT TONGUE WHICH SPEAKS
THE SAME IN ALL AN HOLOCAUST I MADE
TO GOD BEFITTING THE NEW GRACE VOUCHSAFD
AND FROM MY BOSOM HAD NOT YET UPSTEAMD
THE FUMING OF THAT INCENSE WHEN I KNEW
THE RITE ACCEPTED  WITH SUCH MIGHTY SHEEN
AND MANTLING CRIMSON IN TWO LISTED RAYS
THE SPLENDOURS SHOT BEFORE ME THAT I CRIED
GOD OF SABAOTH THAT DOES PRANK THEM THUS

AS LEADS THE GALAXY FROM POLE TO POLE
DISTINGUISHD INTO GREATER LIGHTS AND LESS
ITS PATHWAY WHICH THE WISEST FAIL TO SPELL
SO THICKLY STUDDED IN THE DEPTH OF MARS
THOSE RAYS DESCRIBD THE VENERABLE SIGN
THAT QUADRANTS IN THE ROUND CONJOINING FRAME
HERE MEMORY MOCKS THE TOIL OF GENIUS  CHRIST
BEAMD ON THAT CROSS AND PATTERN FAILS ME NOW
BUT WHOSO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST
WILL PARDON ME FOR THAT I LEAVE UNTOLD
WHEN IN THE FLECKERD DAWNING HE SHALL SPY
THE GLITTERANCE OF CHRIST  FROM HORN TO HORN
AND TWEEN THE SUMMIT AND THE BASE DID MOVE
LIGHTS SCINTILLATING AS THEY MET AND PASSD
THUS OFT ARE SEEN WITH EVERCHANGEFUL GLANCE
STRAIGHT OR ATHWART NOW RAPID AND NOW SLOW
THE ATOMIES OF BODIES LONG OR SHORT
TO MOVE ALONG THE SUNBEAM WHOSE SLANT LINE
CHECKERS THE SHADOW INTERPOSD BY ART
AGAINST THE NOONTIDE HEAT  AND AS THE CHIME
OF MINSTREL MUSIC DULCIMER AND HELP
WITH MANY STRINGS A PLEASANT DINING MAKES
TO HIM WHO HEARETH NOT DISTINCT THE NOTE
SO FROM THE LIGHTS WHICH THERE APPEARD TO ME
GATHERD ALONG THE CROSS A MELODY
THAT INDISTINCTLY HEARD WITH RAVISHMENT
POSSESSD ME  YET I MARKD IT WAS A HYMN
OF LOFTY PRAISES FOR THERE CAME TO ME
ARISE AND CONQUER AS TO ONE WHO HEARS
AND COMPREHENDS NOT  ME SUCH ECSTASY
OERCAME THAT NEVER TILL THAT HOUR WAS THING
THAT HELD ME IN SO SWEET IMPRISONMENT

PERHAPS MY SAYING OVER BOLD APPEARS
ACCOUNTING LESS THE PLEASURE OF THOSE EYES
WHEREON TO LOOK FULFILLETH ALL DESIRE
BUT HE WHO IS AWARE THOSE LIVING SEALS
OF EVERY BEAUTY WORK WITH QUICKER FORCE
THE HIGHER THEY ARE RISN AND THAT THERE
I HAD NOT TURND ME TO THEM HE MAY WELL
EXCUSE ME THAT WHEREOF IN MY EXCUSE
I DO ACCUSE ME AND MAY OWN MY TRUTH
THAT HOLY PLEASURE HERE NOT YET REVEALD
WHICH GROWS IN TRANSPORT AS WE MOUNT ALOOF




CANTO XV

TRUE LOVE THAT EVER SHOWS ITSELF AS CLEAR
IN KINDNESS AS LOOSE APPETITE IN WRONG
SILENCED THAT LYRE HARMONIOUS AND STILLD
THE SACRED CHORDS THAT ARE BY HEAVNS RIGHT HAND
UNWOUND AND TIGHTEND FLOW TO RIGHTEOUS PRAYERS
SHOULD THEY NOT HEARKEN WHO TO GIVE ME WILL
FOR PRAYING IN ACCORDANCE THUS WERE MUTE
HE HATH IN SOOTH GOOD CAUSE FOR ENDLESS GRIEF
WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT LASTETH NOT
DESPOILS HIMSELF FOREVER OF THAT LOVE

AS OFT ALONG THE STILL AND PURE SERENE
AT NIGHTFALL GLIDES A SUDDEN TRAIL OF FIRE
ATTRACTING WITH INVOLUNTARY HEED
THE EYE TO FOLLOW IT EREWHILE AT REST
AND SEEMS SOME STAR THAT SHIFTED PLACE IN HEAVN
ONLY THAT WHENCE IT KINDLES NONE IS LOST
AND IT IS SOON EXTINCT THUS FROM THE HORN
THAT ON THE DEXTER OF THE CROSS EXTENDS
DOWN TO ITS FOOT ONE LUMINARY RAN
FROM MID THE CLUSTER SHONE THERE YET NO GEM
DROPPD FROM ITS FOIL AND THROUGH THE BEAMY LIST
LIKE FLAME IN ALABASTER GLOWD ITS COURSE

SO FORWARD STRETCHD HIM IF OF CREDENCE AUGHT
OUR GREATER MUSE MAY CLAIM THE PIOUS GHOST
OF OLD ANCHISES IN THE ELYSIAN BOWER
WHEN HE PERCEIVD HIS SON  O THOU MY BLOOD
O MOST EXCEEDING GRACE DIVINE TO WHOM
AS NOW TO THEE HATH TWICE THE HEAVNLY GATE
BEEN EER UNCLOSD SO SPAKE THE LIGHT WHENCE I
TURND ME TOWARD HIM THEN UNTO MY DAME
MY SIGHT DIRECTED AND ON EITHER SIDE
AMAZEMENT WAITED ME FOR IN HER EYES
WAS LIGHTED SUCH A SMILE I THOUGHT THAT MINE
HAD DIVD UNTO THE BOTTOM OF MY GRACE
AND OF MY BLISS IN PARADISE  FORTHWITH
TO HEARING AND TO SIGHT GRATEFUL ALIKE
THE SPIRIT TO HIS PROEM ADDED THINGS
I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND HE SPAKE
YET NOT OF CHOICE BUT THROUGH NECESSITY
MYSTERIOUS FOR HIS HIGH CONCEPTION SCARD
BEYOND THE MARK OF MORTALS  WHEN THE FLIGHT
OF HOLY TRANSPORT HAD SO SPENT ITS RAGE
THAT NEARER TO THE LEVEL OF OUR THOUGHT
THE SPEECH DESCENDED THE FIRST SOUNDS I HEARD
WERE BEST HE THOU TRIUNAL DEITY
THAT HAST SUCH FAVOUR IN MY SEED VOUCHSAFD
THEN FOLLOWD NO UNPLEASANT THIRST THO LONG
WHICH TOOK ME READING IN THE SACRED BOOK
WHOSE LEAVES OR WHITE OR DUSKY NEVER CHANGE
THOU HAST ALLAYD MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT
FROM WHENCE MY VOICE THOU HEARST MORE THANKS TO HER
WHO FOR SUCH LOFTY MOUNTING HAS WITH PLUMES
BEGIRT THEE  THOU DOST DEEM THY THOUGHTS TO ME
FROM HIM TRANSMITTED WHO IS FIRST OF ALL
EEN AS ALL NUMBERS RAY FROM UNITY
AND THEREFORE DOST NOT ASK ME WHO I AM
OR WHY TO THEE MORE JOYOUS I APPEAR
THAN ANY OTHER IN THIS GLADSOME THRONG
THE TRUTH IS AS THOU DEEMST FOR IN THIS HUE
BOTH LESS AND GREATER IN THAT MIRROR LOOK
IN WHICH THY THOUGHTS OR ERE THOU THINKST ARE SHOWN
BUT THAT THE LOVE WHICH KEEPS ME WAKEFUL EVER
URGING WITH SACRED THIRST OF SWEET DESIRE
MAY BE CONTENDED FULLY LET THY VOICE
FEARLESS AND FRANK AND JOCUND UTTER FORTH
THY WILL DISTINCTLY UTTER FORTH THE WISH
WHERETO MY READY ANSWER STANDS DECREED

I TURND ME TO BEATRICE AND SHE HEARD
ERE I HAD SPOKEN
