CHAPTER I


MY FATHERS FAMILY NAME BEING PIRRIP AND MY CHRISTIAN NAME PHILIP MY
INFANT TONGUE COULD MAKE OF BOTH NAMES NOTHING LONGER OR MORE EXPLICIT
THAN PIP SO I CALLED MYSELF PIP AND CAME TO BE CALLED PIP

I GIVE PIRRIP AS MY FATHERS FAMILY NAME ON THE AUTHORITY OF HIS
TOMBSTONE AND MY SISTERMRS JOE GARGERY WHO MARRIED THE BLACKSMITH
AS I NEVER SAW MY FATHER OR MY MOTHER AND NEVER SAW ANY LIKENESS OF
EITHER OF THEM FOR THEIR DAYS WERE LONG BEFORE THE DAYS OF
PHOTOGRAPHS MY FIRST FANCIES REGARDING WHAT THEY WERE LIKE WERE
UNREASONABLY DERIVED FROM THEIR TOMBSTONES THE SHAPE OF THE LETTERS ON
MY FATHERS GAVE ME AN ODD IDEA THAT HE WAS A SQUARE STOUT DARK MAN
WITH CURLY BLACK HAIR FROM THE CHARACTER AND TURN OF THE INSCRIPTION
ALSO GEORGIANA WIFE OF THE ABOVE I DREW A CHILDISH CONCLUSION THAT
MY MOTHER WAS FRECKLED AND SICKLY TO FIVE LITTLE STONE LOZENGES EACH
ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF LONG WHICH WERE ARRANGED IN A NEAT ROW BESIDE
THEIR GRAVE AND WERE SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF FIVE LITTLE BROTHERS OF
MINEWHO GAVE UP TRYING TO GET A LIVING EXCEEDINGLY EARLY IN THAT
UNIVERSAL STRUGGLEI AM INDEBTED FOR A BELIEF I RELIGIOUSLY
ENTERTAINED THAT THEY HAD ALL BEEN BORN ON THEIR BACKS WITH THEIR HANDS
IN THEIR TROUSERSPOCKETS AND HAD NEVER TAKEN THEM OUT IN THIS STATE
OF EXISTENCE

OURS WAS THE MARSH COUNTRY DOWN BY THE RIVER WITHIN AS THE RIVER
WOUND TWENTY MILES OF THE SEA MY FIRST MOST VIVID AND BROAD
IMPRESSION OF THE IDENTITY OF THINGS SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE BEEN GAINED ON
A MEMORABLE RAW AFTERNOON TOWARDS EVENING AT SUCH A TIME I FOUND OUT
FOR CERTAIN THAT THIS BLEAK PLACE OVERGROWN WITH NETTLES WAS THE
CHURCHYARD AND THAT PHILIP PIRRIP LATE OF THIS PARISH AND ALSO
GEORGIANA WIFE OF THE ABOVE WERE DEAD AND BURIED AND THAT ALEXANDER
BARTHOLOMEW ABRAHAM TOBIAS AND ROGER INFANT CHILDREN OF THE
AFORESAID WERE ALSO DEAD AND BURIED AND THAT THE DARK FLAT WILDERNESS
BEYOND THE CHURCHYARD INTERSECTED WITH DIKES AND MOUNDS AND GATES
WITH SCATTERED CATTLE FEEDING ON IT WAS THE MARSHES AND THAT THE LOW
LEADEN LINE BEYOND WAS THE RIVER AND THAT THE DISTANT SAVAGE LAIR FROM
WHICH THE WIND WAS RUSHING WAS THE SEA AND THAT THE SMALL BUNDLE OF
SHIVERS GROWING AFRAID OF IT ALL AND BEGINNING TO CRY WAS PIP

HOLD YOUR NOISE CRIED A TERRIBLE VOICE AS A MAN STARTED UP FROM
AMONG THE GRAVES AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH PORCH KEEP STILL YOU
LITTLE DEVIL OR ILL CUT YOUR THROAT

A FEARFUL MAN ALL IN COARSE GREY WITH A GREAT IRON ON HIS LEG A MAN
WITH NO HAT AND WITH BROKEN SHOES AND WITH AN OLD RAG TIED ROUND HIS
HEAD A MAN WHO HAD BEEN SOAKED IN WATER AND SMOTHERED IN MUD AND
LAMED BY STONES AND CUT BY FLINTS AND STUNG BY NETTLES AND TORN BY
BRIARS WHO LIMPED AND SHIVERED AND GLARED AND GROWLED AND WHOSE
TEETH CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AS HE SEIZED ME BY THE CHIN

OH DONT CUT MY THROAT SIR I PLEADED IN TERROR PRAY DONT DO IT
SIR

TELL US YOUR NAME SAID THE MAN QUICK

PIP SIR

ONCE MORE SAID THE MAN STARING AT ME GIVE IT MOUTH

PIP PIP SIR

SHOW US WHERE YOU LIVE SAID THE MAN PINT OUT THE PLACE

I POINTED TO WHERE OUR VILLAGE LAY ON THE FLAT INSHORE AMONG THE
ALDERTREES AND POLLARDS A MILE OR MORE FROM THE CHURCH

THE MAN AFTER LOOKING AT ME FOR A MOMENT TURNED ME UPSIDE DOWN AND
EMPTIED MY POCKETS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THEM BUT A PIECE OF BREAD
WHEN THE CHURCH CAME TO ITSELFFOR HE WAS SO SUDDEN AND STRONG THAT HE
MADE IT GO HEAD OVER HEELS BEFORE ME AND I SAW THE STEEPLE UNDER MY
FEETWHEN THE CHURCH CAME TO ITSELF I SAY I WAS SEATED ON A HIGH
TOMBSTONE TREMBLING WHILE HE ATE THE BREAD RAVENOUSLY

ILLUSTRATION

YOU YOUNG DOG SAID THE MAN LICKING HIS LIPS WHAT FAT CHEEKS YOU
HA GOT

I BELIEVE THEY WERE FAT THOUGH I WAS AT THAT TIME UNDERSIZED FOR MY
YEARS AND NOT STRONG

DARN ME IF I COULDNT EAT EM SAID THE MAN WITH A THREATENING SHAKE
OF HIS HEAD AND IF I HANT HALF A MIND TOT

I EARNESTLY EXPRESSED MY HOPE THAT HE WOULDNT AND HELD TIGHTER TO THE
TOMBSTONE ON WHICH HE HAD PUT ME PARTLY TO KEEP MYSELF UPON IT
PARTLY TO KEEP MYSELF FROM CRYING

NOW LOOKEE HERE SAID THE MAN WHERES YOUR MOTHER

THERE SIR SAID I

HE STARTED MADE A SHORT RUN AND STOPPED AND LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER

THERE SIR I TIMIDLY EXPLAINED ALSO GEORGIANA THATS MY MOTHER

OH SAID HE COMING BACK AND IS THAT YOUR FATHER ALONGER YOUR
MOTHER

YES SIR SAID I HIM TOO LATE OF THIS PARISH

HA HE MUTTERED THEN CONSIDERING WHO DYE LIVE WITHSUPPOSIN
YOURE KINDLY LET TO LIVE WHICH I HANT MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT

MY SISTER SIRMRS JOE GARGERYWIFE OF JOE GARGERY THE BLACKSMITH
SIR

BLACKSMITH EH SAID HE AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIS LEG

AFTER DARKLY LOOKING AT HIS LEG AND ME SEVERAL TIMES HE CAME CLOSER TO
MY TOMBSTONE TOOK ME BY BOTH ARMS AND TILTED ME BACK AS FAR AS HE
COULD HOLD ME SO THAT HIS EYES LOOKED MOST POWERFULLY DOWN INTO MINE
AND MINE LOOKED MOST HELPLESSLY UP INTO HIS

NOW LOOKEE HERE HE SAID THE QUESTION BEING WHETHER YOURE TO BE
LET TO LIVE YOU KNOW WHAT A FILE IS

YES SIR

AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITTLES IS

YES SIR

AFTER EACH QUESTION HE TILTED ME OVER A LITTLE MORE SO AS TO GIVE ME A
GREATER SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS AND DANGER

YOU GET ME A FILE HE TILTED ME AGAIN AND YOU GET ME WITTLES HE
TILTED ME AGAIN YOU BRING EM BOTH TO ME HE TILTED ME AGAIN OR
ILL HAVE YOUR HEART AND LIVER OUT HE TILTED ME AGAIN

I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED AND SO GIDDY THAT I CLUNG TO HIM WITH BOTH
HANDS AND SAID IF YOU WOULD KINDLY PLEASE TO LET ME KEEP UPRIGHT
SIR PERHAPS I SHOULDNT BE SICK AND PERHAPS I COULD ATTEND MORE

HE GAVE ME A MOST TREMENDOUS DIP AND ROLL SO THAT THE CHURCH JUMPED
OVER ITS OWN WEATHERCOCK THEN HE HELD ME BY THE ARMS IN AN UPRIGHT
POSITION ON THE TOP OF THE STONE AND WENT ON IN THESE FEARFUL TERMS

YOU BRING ME TOMORROW MORNING EARLY THAT FILE AND THEM WITTLES YOU
BRING THE LOT TO ME AT THAT OLD BATTERY OVER YONDER YOU DO IT AND
YOU NEVER DARE TO SAY A WORD OR DARE TO MAKE A SIGN CONCERNING YOUR
HAVING SEEN SUCH A PERSON AS ME OR ANY PERSON SUMEVER AND YOU SHALL
BE LET TO LIVE YOU FAIL OR YOU GO FROM MY WORDS IN ANY PARTICKLER NO
MATTER HOW SMALL IT IS AND YOUR HEART AND YOUR LIVER SHALL BE TORE
OUT ROASTED AND ATE NOW I AINT ALONE AS YOU MAY THINK I AM
THERES A YOUNG MAN HID WITH ME IN COMPARISON WITH WHICH YOUNG MAN I
AM A ANGEL THAT YOUNG MAN HEARS THE WORDS I SPEAK THAT YOUNG MAN HAS
A SECRET WAY PECOOLIAR TO HIMSELF OF GETTING AT A BOY AND AT HIS
HEART AND AT HIS LIVER IT IS IN WAIN FOR A BOY TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE
HIMSELF FROM THAT YOUNG MAN A BOY MAY LOCK HIS DOOR MAY BE WARM IN
BED MAY TUCK HIMSELF UP MAY DRAW THE CLOTHES OVER HIS HEAD MAY THINK
HIMSELF COMFORTABLE AND SAFE BUT THAT YOUNG MAN WILL SOFTLY CREEP AND
CREEP HIS WAY TO HIM AND TEAR HIM OPEN I AM A KEEPING THAT YOUNG MAN
FROM HARMING OF YOU AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I
FIND IT WERY HARD TO HOLD THAT YOUNG MAN OFF OF YOUR INSIDE NOW WHAT
DO YOU SAY

I SAID THAT I WOULD GET HIM THE FILE AND I WOULD GET HIM WHAT BROKEN
BITS OF FOOD I COULD AND I WOULD COME TO HIM AT THE BATTERY EARLY IN
THE MORNING

SAY LORD STRIKE YOU DEAD IF YOU DONT SAID THE MAN

I SAID SO AND HE TOOK ME DOWN

NOW HE PURSUED YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUVE UNDERTOOK AND YOU
REMEMBER THAT YOUNG MAN AND YOU GET HOME

GOOGOOD NIGHT SIR I FALTERED

MUCH OF THAT SAID HE GLANCING ABOUT HIM OVER THE COLD WET FLAT I
WISH I WAS A FROG OR A EEL

AT THE SAME TIME HE HUGGED HIS SHUDDERING BODY IN BOTH HIS
ARMSCLASPING HIMSELF AS IF TO HOLD HIMSELF TOGETHERAND LIMPED
TOWARDS THE LOW CHURCH WALL AS I SAW HIM GO PICKING HIS WAY AMONG THE
NETTLES AND AMONG THE BRAMBLES THAT BOUND THE GREEN MOUNDS HE LOOKED
IN MY YOUNG EYES AS IF HE WERE ELUDING THE HANDS OF THE DEAD PEOPLE
STRETCHING UP CAUTIOUSLY OUT OF THEIR GRAVES TO GET A TWIST UPON HIS
ANKLE AND PULL HIM IN

WHEN HE CAME TO THE LOW CHURCH WALL HE GOT OVER IT LIKE A MAN WHOSE
LEGS WERE NUMBED AND STIFF AND THEN TURNED ROUND TO LOOK FOR ME WHEN
I SAW HIM TURNING I SET MY FACE TOWARDS HOME AND MADE THE BEST USE OF
MY LEGS BUT PRESENTLY I LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIM GOING ON
AGAIN TOWARDS THE RIVER STILL HUGGING HIMSELF IN BOTH ARMS AND
PICKING HIS WAY WITH HIS SORE FEET AMONG THE GREAT STONES DROPPED INTO
THE MARSHES HERE AND THERE FOR STEPPINGPLACES WHEN THE RAINS WERE
HEAVY OR THE TIDE WAS IN

THE MARSHES WERE JUST A LONG BLACK HORIZONTAL LINE THEN AS I STOPPED
TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND THE RIVER WAS JUST ANOTHER HORIZONTAL LINE NOT
NEARLY SO BROAD NOR YET SO BLACK AND THE SKY WAS JUST A ROW OF LONG
ANGRY RED LINES AND DENSE BLACK LINES INTERMIXED ON THE EDGE OF THE
RIVER I COULD FAINTLY MAKE OUT THE ONLY TWO BLACK THINGS IN ALL THE
PROSPECT THAT SEEMED TO BE STANDING UPRIGHT ONE OF THESE WAS THE
BEACON BY WHICH THE SAILORS STEEREDLIKE AN UNHOOPED CASK UPON A
POLEAN UGLY THING WHEN YOU WERE NEAR IT THE OTHER A GIBBET WITH
SOME CHAINS HANGING TO IT WHICH HAD ONCE HELD A PIRATE THE MAN WAS
LIMPING ON TOWARDS THIS LATTER AS IF HE WERE THE PIRATE COME TO LIFE
AND COME DOWN AND GOING BACK TO HOOK HIMSELF UP AGAIN IT GAVE ME A
TERRIBLE TURN WHEN I THOUGHT SO AND AS I SAW THE CATTLE LIFTING THEIR
HEADS TO GAZE AFTER HIM I WONDERED WHETHER THEY THOUGHT SO TOO I
LOOKED ALL ROUND FOR THE HORRIBLE YOUNG MAN AND COULD SEE NO SIGNS OF
HIM BUT NOW I WAS FRIGHTENED AGAIN AND RAN HOME WITHOUT STOPPING




CHAPTER II


MY SISTER MRS JOE GARGERY WAS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN I
AND HAD ESTABLISHED A GREAT REPUTATION WITH HERSELF AND THE NEIGHBOURS
BECAUSE SHE HAD BROUGHT ME UP BY HAND HAVING AT THAT TIME TO FIND
OUT FOR MYSELF WHAT THE EXPRESSION MEANT AND KNOWING HER TO HAVE A
HARD AND HEAVY HAND AND TO BE MUCH IN THE HABIT OF LAYING IT UPON HER
HUSBAND AS WELL AS UPON ME I SUPPOSED THAT JOE GARGERY AND I WERE BOTH
BROUGHT UP BY HAND

SHE WAS NOT A GOODLOOKING WOMAN MY SISTER AND I HAD A GENERAL
IMPRESSION THAT SHE MUST HAVE MADE JOE GARGERY MARRY HER BY HAND JOE
WAS A FAIR MAN WITH CURLS OF FLAXEN HAIR ON EACH SIDE OF HIS SMOOTH
FACE AND WITH EYES OF SUCH A VERY UNDECIDED BLUE THAT THEY SEEMED TO
HAVE SOMEHOW GOT MIXED WITH THEIR OWN WHITES HE WAS A MILD
GOODNATURED SWEETTEMPERED EASYGOING FOOLISH DEAR FELLOWA SORT
OF HERCULES IN STRENGTH AND ALSO IN WEAKNESS

MY SISTER MRS JOE WITH BLACK HAIR AND EYES HAD SUCH A PREVAILING
REDNESS OF SKIN THAT I SOMETIMES USED TO WONDER WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE
SHE WASHED HERSELF WITH A NUTMEGGRATER INSTEAD OF SOAP SHE WAS TALL
AND BONY AND ALMOST ALWAYS WORE A COARSE APRON FASTENED OVER HER
FIGURE BEHIND WITH TWO LOOPS AND HAVING A SQUARE IMPREGNABLE BIB IN
FRONT THAT WAS STUCK FULL OF PINS AND NEEDLES SHE MADE IT A POWERFUL
MERIT IN HERSELF AND A STRONG REPROACH AGAINST JOE THAT SHE WORE THIS
APRON SO MUCH THOUGH I REALLY SEE NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD HAVE WORN
IT AT ALL OR WHY IF SHE DID WEAR IT AT ALL SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN
IT OFF EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE

JOES FORGE ADJOINED OUR HOUSE WHICH WAS A WOODEN HOUSE AS MANY OF
THE DWELLINGS IN OUR COUNTRY WEREMOST OF THEM AT THAT TIME WHEN I
RAN HOME FROM THE CHURCHYARD THE FORGE WAS SHUT UP AND JOE WAS
SITTING ALONE IN THE KITCHEN JOE AND I BEING FELLOWSUFFERERS AND
HAVING CONFIDENCES AS SUCH JOE IMPARTED A CONFIDENCE TO ME THE MOMENT
I RAISED THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AND PEEPED IN AT HIM OPPOSITE TO IT
SITTING IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER

MRS JOE HAS BEEN OUT A DOZEN TIMES LOOKING FOR YOU PIP AND SHES
OUT NOW MAKING IT A BAKERS DOZEN

IS SHE

YES PIP SAID JOE AND WHATS WORSE SHES GOT TICKLER WITH HER

AT THIS DISMAL INTELLIGENCE I TWISTED THE ONLY BUTTON ON MY WAISTCOAT
ROUND AND ROUND AND LOOKED IN GREAT DEPRESSION AT THE FIRE TICKLER
WAS A WAXENDED PIECE OF CANE WORN SMOOTH BY COLLISION WITH MY TICKLED
FRAME

SHE SOT DOWN SAID JOE AND SHE GOT UP AND SHE MADE A GRAB AT
TICKLER AND SHE RAMPAGED OUT THATS WHAT SHE DID SAID JOE SLOWLY
CLEARING THE FIRE BETWEEN THE LOWER BARS WITH THE POKER AND LOOKING AT
IT SHE RAMPAGED OUT PIP

HAS SHE BEEN GONE LONG JOE I ALWAYS TREATED HIM AS A LARGER SPECIES
OF CHILD AND AS NO MORE THAN MY EQUAL

WELL SAID JOE GLANCING UP AT THE DUTCH CLOCK SHES BEEN ON THE
RAMPAGE THIS LAST SPELL ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PIP SHES ACOMING GET
BEHIND THE DOOR OLD CHAP AND HAVE THE JACKTOWEL BETWIXT YOU

I TOOK THE ADVICE MY SISTER MRS JOE THROWING THE DOOR WIDE OPEN
AND FINDING AN OBSTRUCTION BEHIND IT IMMEDIATELY DIVINED THE CAUSE
AND APPLIED TICKLER TO ITS FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHE CONCLUDED BY
THROWING MEI OFTEN SERVED AS A CONNUBIAL MISSILEAT JOE WHO GLAD TO
GET HOLD OF ME ON ANY TERMS PASSED ME ON INTO THE CHIMNEY AND QUIETLY
FENCED ME UP THERE WITH HIS GREAT LEG

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN YOU YOUNG MONKEY SAID MRS JOE STAMPING HER
FOOT TELL ME DIRECTLY WHAT YOUVE BEEN DOING TO WEAR ME AWAY WITH
FRET AND FRIGHT AND WORRIT OR ID HAVE YOU OUT OF THAT CORNER IF YOU
WAS FIFTY PIPS AND HE WAS FIVE HUNDRED GARGERYS

I HAVE ONLY BEEN TO THE CHURCHYARD SAID I FROM MY STOOL CRYING AND
RUBBING MYSELF

CHURCHYARD REPEATED MY SISTER IF IT WARNT FOR ME YOUD HAVE BEEN
TO THE CHURCHYARD LONG AGO AND STAYED THERE WHO BROUGHT YOU UP BY
HAND

YOU DID SAID I

AND WHY DID I DO IT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW EXCLAIMED MY SISTER

I WHIMPERED I DONT KNOW

I DONT SAID MY SISTER ID NEVER DO IT AGAIN I KNOW THAT I MAY
TRULY SAY IVE NEVER HAD THIS APRON OF MINE OFF SINCE BORN YOU WERE
ITS BAD ENOUGH TO BE A BLACKSMITHS WIFE AND HIM A GARGERY WITHOUT
BEING YOUR MOTHER

MY THOUGHTS STRAYED FROM THAT QUESTION AS I LOOKED DISCONSOLATELY AT
THE FIRE FOR THE FUGITIVE OUT ON THE MARSHES WITH THE IRONED LEG THE
MYSTERIOUS YOUNG MAN THE FILE THE FOOD AND THE DREADFUL PLEDGE I WAS
UNDER TO COMMIT A LARCENY ON THOSE SHELTERING PREMISES ROSE BEFORE ME
IN THE AVENGING COALS

HAH SAID MRS JOE RESTORING TICKLER TO HIS STATION CHURCHYARD
INDEED YOU MAY WELL SAY CHURCHYARD YOU TWO ONE OF US BY THE BY
HAD NOT SAID IT AT ALL YOULL DRIVE ME TO THE CHURCHYARD BETWIXT
YOU ONE OF THESE DAYS AND O A PRRRECIOUS PAIR YOUD BE WITHOUT
ME

AS SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO SET THE TEATHINGS JOE PEEPED DOWN AT ME
OVER HIS LEG AS IF HE WERE MENTALLY CASTING ME AND HIMSELF UP AND
CALCULATING WHAT KIND OF PAIR WE PRACTICALLY SHOULD MAKE UNDER THE
GRIEVOUS CIRCUMSTANCES FORESHADOWED AFTER THAT HE SAT FEELING HIS
RIGHTSIDE FLAXEN CURLS AND WHISKER AND FOLLOWING MRS JOE ABOUT WITH
HIS BLUE EYES AS HIS MANNER ALWAYS WAS AT SQUALLY TIMES

MY SISTER HAD A TRENCHANT WAY OF CUTTING OUR BREAD AND BUTTER FOR US
THAT NEVER VARIED FIRST WITH HER LEFT HAND SHE JAMMED THE LOAF HARD
AND FAST AGAINST HER BIBWHERE IT SOMETIMES GOT A PIN INTO IT AND
SOMETIMES A NEEDLE WHICH WE AFTERWARDS GOT INTO OUR MOUTHS THEN SHE
TOOK SOME BUTTER NOT TOO MUCH ON A KNIFE AND SPREAD IT ON THE LOAF
IN AN APOTHECARY KIND OF WAY AS IF SHE WERE MAKING A PLASTERUSING
BOTH SIDES OF THE KNIFE WITH A SLAPPING DEXTERITY AND TRIMMING AND
MOULDING THE BUTTER OFF ROUND THE CRUST THEN SHE GAVE THE KNIFE A
FINAL SMART WIPE ON THE EDGE OF THE PLASTER AND THEN SAWED A VERY
THICK ROUND OFF THE LOAF WHICH SHE FINALLY BEFORE SEPARATING FROM THE
LOAF HEWED INTO TWO HALVES OF WHICH JOE GOT ONE AND I THE OTHER

ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THOUGH I WAS HUNGRY I DARED NOT EAT MY SLICE
I FELT THAT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN RESERVE FOR MY DREADFUL
ACQUAINTANCE AND HIS ALLY THE STILL MORE DREADFUL YOUNG MAN I KNEW
MRS JOES HOUSEKEEPING TO BE OF THE STRICTEST KIND AND THAT MY
LARCENOUS RESEARCHES MIGHT FIND NOTHING AVAILABLE IN THE SAFE
THEREFORE I RESOLVED TO PUT MY HUNK OF BREAD AND BUTTER DOWN THE LEG OF
MY TROUSERS

THE EFFORT OF RESOLUTION NECESSARY TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS PURPOSE I
FOUND TO BE QUITE AWFUL IT WAS AS IF I HAD TO MAKE UP MY MIND TO LEAP
FROM THE TOP OF A HIGH HOUSE OR PLUNGE INTO A GREAT DEPTH OF WATER
AND IT WAS MADE THE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE UNCONSCIOUS JOE IN OUR
ALREADYMENTIONED FREEMASONRY AS FELLOWSUFFERERS AND IN HIS
GOODNATURED COMPANIONSHIP WITH ME IT WAS OUR EVENING HABIT TO COMPARE
THE WAY WE BIT THROUGH OUR SLICES BY SILENTLY HOLDING THEM UP TO EACH
OTHERS ADMIRATION NOW AND THENWHICH STIMULATED US TO NEW EXERTIONS
TONIGHT JOE SEVERAL TIMES INVITED ME BY THE DISPLAY OF HIS FAST
DIMINISHING SLICE TO ENTER UPON OUR USUAL FRIENDLY COMPETITION BUT HE
FOUND ME EACH TIME WITH MY YELLOW MUG OF TEA ON ONE KNEE AND MY
UNTOUCHED BREAD AND BUTTER ON THE OTHER AT LAST I DESPERATELY
CONSIDERED THAT THE THING I CONTEMPLATED MUST BE DONE AND THAT IT HAD
BEST BE DONE IN THE LEAST IMPROBABLE MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE
CIRCUMSTANCES I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN JOE HAD JUST LOOKED AT
ME AND GOT MY BREAD AND BUTTER DOWN MY LEG

JOE WAS EVIDENTLY MADE UNCOMFORTABLE BY WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE MY LOSS
OF APPETITE AND TOOK A THOUGHTFUL BITE OUT OF HIS SLICE WHICH HE
DIDNT SEEM TO ENJOY HE TURNED IT ABOUT IN HIS MOUTH MUCH LONGER THAN
USUAL PONDERING OVER IT A GOOD DEAL AND AFTER ALL GULPED IT DOWN LIKE
A PILL HE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE ANOTHER BITE AND HAD JUST GOT HIS HEAD ON
ONE SIDE FOR A GOOD PURCHASE ON IT WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON ME AND HE SAW
THAT MY BREAD AND BUTTER WAS GONE

THE WONDER AND CONSTERNATION WITH WHICH JOE STOPPED ON THE THRESHOLD OF
HIS BITE AND STARED AT ME WERE TOO EVIDENT TO ESCAPE MY SISTERS
OBSERVATION

WHATS THE MATTER NOW SAID SHE SMARTLY AS SHE PUT DOWN HER CUP

I SAY YOU KNOW MUTTERED JOE SHAKING HIS HEAD AT ME IN VERY SERIOUS
REMONSTRANCE PIP OLD CHAP YOULL DO YOURSELF A MISCHIEF ITLL
STICK SOMEWHERE YOU CANT HAVE CHAWED IT PIP

WHATS THE MATTER NOW REPEATED MY SISTER MORE SHARPLY THAN BEFORE

IF YOU CAN COUGH ANY TRIFLE ON IT UP PIP ID RECOMMEND YOU TO DO
IT SAID JOE ALL AGHAST MANNERS IS MANNERS BUT STILL YOUR ELTHS
YOUR ELTH

BY THIS TIME MY SISTER WAS QUITE DESPERATE SO SHE POUNCED ON JOE
AND TAKING HIM BY THE TWO WHISKERS KNOCKED HIS HEAD FOR A LITTLE
WHILE AGAINST THE WALL BEHIND HIM WHILE I SAT IN THE CORNER LOOKING
GUILTILY ON

NOW PERHAPS YOULL MENTION WHATS THE MATTER SAID MY SISTER OUT OF
BREATH YOU STARING GREAT STUCK PIG

JOE LOOKED AT HER IN A HELPLESS WAY THEN TOOK A HELPLESS BITE AND
LOOKED AT ME AGAIN

YOU KNOW PIP SAID JOE SOLEMNLY WITH HIS LAST BITE IN HIS CHEEK
AND SPEAKING IN A CONFIDENTIAL VOICE AS IF WE TWO WERE QUITE ALONE
YOU AND ME IS ALWAYS FRIENDS AND ID BE THE LAST TO TELL UPON YOU
ANY TIME BUT SUCH A HE MOVED HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED ABOUT THE FLOOR
BETWEEN US AND THEN AGAIN AT MESUCH A MOST ONCOMMON BOLT AS THAT

BEEN BOLTING HIS FOOD HAS HE CRIED MY SISTER

YOU KNOW OLD CHAP SAID JOE LOOKING AT ME AND NOT AT MRS JOE
WITH HIS BITE STILL IN HIS CHEEK I BOLTED MYSELF WHEN I WAS YOUR
AGEFREQUENTAND AS A BOY IVE BEEN AMONG A MANY BOLTERS BUT I NEVER
SEE YOUR BOLTING EQUAL YET PIP AND ITS A MERCY YOU AINT BOLTED
DEAD

MY SISTER MADE A DIVE AT ME AND FISHED ME UP BY THE HAIR SAYING
NOTHING MORE THAN THE AWFUL WORDS YOU COME ALONG AND BE DOSED

SOME MEDICAL BEAST HAD REVIVED TARWATER IN THOSE DAYS AS A FINE
MEDICINE AND MRS JOE ALWAYS KEPT A SUPPLY OF IT IN THE CUPBOARD
HAVING A BELIEF IN ITS VIRTUES CORRESPONDENT TO ITS NASTINESS AT THE
BEST OF TIMES SO MUCH OF THIS ELIXIR WAS ADMINISTERED TO ME AS A
CHOICE RESTORATIVE THAT I WAS CONSCIOUS OF GOING ABOUT SMELLING LIKE
A NEW FENCE ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING THE URGENCY OF MY CASE DEMANDED
A PINT OF THIS MIXTURE WHICH WAS POURED DOWN MY THROAT FOR MY GREATER
COMFORT WHILE MRS JOE HELD MY HEAD UNDER HER ARM AS A BOOT WOULD BE
HELD IN A BOOTJACK JOE GOT OFF WITH HALF A PINT BUT WAS MADE TO
SWALLOW THAT MUCH TO HIS DISTURBANCE AS HE SAT SLOWLY MUNCHING AND
MEDITATING BEFORE THE FIRE BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A TURN JUDGING FROM
MYSELF I SHOULD SAY HE CERTAINLY HAD A TURN AFTERWARDS IF HE HAD HAD
NONE BEFORE

CONSCIENCE IS A DREADFUL THING WHEN IT ACCUSES MAN OR BOY BUT WHEN IN
THE CASE OF A BOY THAT SECRET BURDEN COOPERATES WITH ANOTHER SECRET
BURDEN DOWN THE LEG OF HIS TROUSERS IT IS AS I CAN TESTIFY A GREAT
PUNISHMENT THE GUILTY KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS GOING TO ROB MRS JOEI
NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO ROB JOE FOR I NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY OF THE
HOUSEKEEPING PROPERTY AS HISUNITED TO THE NECESSITY OF ALWAYS KEEPING
ONE HAND ON MY BREAD AND BUTTER AS I SAT OR WHEN I WAS ORDERED ABOUT
THE KITCHEN ON ANY SMALL ERRAND ALMOST DROVE ME OUT OF MY MIND THEN
AS THE MARSH WINDS MADE THE FIRE GLOW AND FLARE I THOUGHT I HEARD THE
VOICE OUTSIDE OF THE MAN WITH THE IRON ON HIS LEG WHO HAD SWORN ME TO
SECRECY DECLARING THAT HE COULDNT AND WOULDNT STARVE UNTIL
TOMORROW BUT MUST BE FED NOW AT OTHER TIMES I THOUGHT WHAT IF THE
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS WITH SO MUCH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED FROM IMBRUING HIS
HANDS IN ME SHOULD YIELD TO A CONSTITUTIONAL IMPATIENCE OR SHOULD
MISTAKE THE TIME AND SHOULD THINK HIMSELF ACCREDITED TO MY HEART AND
LIVER TONIGHT INSTEAD OF TOMORROW IF EVER ANYBODYS HAIR STOOD ON
END WITH TERROR MINE MUST HAVE DONE SO THEN BUT PERHAPS NOBODYS
EVER DID

IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE AND I HAD TO STIR THE PUDDING FOR NEXT DAY WITH
A COPPERSTICK FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT BY THE DUTCH CLOCK I TRIED IT WITH
THE LOAD UPON MY LEG AND THAT MADE ME THINK AFRESH OF THE MAN WITH THE
LOAD ON HIS LEG AND FOUND THE TENDENCY OF EXERCISE TO BRING THE
BREAD AND BUTTER OUT AT MY ANKLE QUITE UNMANAGEABLE HAPPILY I SLIPPED
AWAY AND DEPOSITED THAT PART OF MY CONSCIENCE IN MY GARRET BEDROOM

HARK SAID I WHEN I HAD DONE MY STIRRING AND WAS TAKING A FINAL
WARM IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER BEFORE BEING SENT UP TO BED WAS THAT GREAT
GUNS JOE

AH SAID JOE THERES ANOTHER CONWICT OFF

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN JOE SAID I

MRS JOE WHO ALWAYS TOOK EXPLANATIONS UPON HERSELF SAID SNAPPISHLY
ESCAPED ESCAPED ADMINISTERING THE DEFINITION LIKE TARWATER

WHILE MRS JOE SAT WITH HER HEAD BENDING OVER HER NEEDLEWORK I PUT MY
MOUTH INTO THE FORMS OF SAYING TO JOE WHATS A CONVICT JOE PUT
HIS MOUTH INTO THE FORMS OF RETURNING SUCH A HIGHLY ELABORATE ANSWER
THAT I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING OF IT BUT THE SINGLE WORD PIP

THERE WAS A CONWICT OFF LAST NIGHT SAID JOE ALOUD AFTER
SUNSETGUN AND THEY FIRED WARNING OF HIM AND NOW IT APPEARS THEYRE
FIRING WARNING OF ANOTHER

WHOS FIRING SAID I

DRAT THAT BOY INTERPOSED MY SISTER FROWNING AT ME OVER HER WORK
WHAT A QUESTIONER HE IS ASK NO QUESTIONS AND YOULL BE TOLD NO
LIES

IT WAS NOT VERY POLITE TO HERSELF I THOUGHT TO IMPLY THAT I SHOULD BE
TOLD LIES BY HER EVEN IF I DID ASK QUESTIONS BUT SHE NEVER WAS POLITE
UNLESS THERE WAS COMPANY

AT THIS POINT JOE GREATLY AUGMENTED MY CURIOSITY BY TAKING THE UTMOST
PAINS TO OPEN HIS MOUTH VERY WIDE AND TO PUT IT INTO THE FORM OF A
WORD THAT LOOKED TO ME LIKE SULKS THEREFORE I NATURALLY POINTED TO
MRS JOE AND PUT MY MOUTH INTO THE FORM OF SAYING HER BUT JOE
WOULDNT HEAR OF THAT AT ALL AND AGAIN OPENED HIS MOUTH VERY WIDE
AND SHOOK THE FORM OF A MOST EMPHATIC WORD OUT OF IT BUT I COULD MAKE
NOTHING OF THE WORD

MRS JOE SAID I AS A LAST RESORT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOWIF YOU
WOULDNT MUCH MINDWHERE THE FIRING COMES FROM

LORD BLESS THE BOY EXCLAIMED MY SISTER AS IF SHE DIDNT QUITE MEAN
THAT BUT RATHER THE CONTRARY FROM THE HULKS

OHH SAID I LOOKING AT JOE HULKS

JOE GAVE A REPROACHFUL COUGH AS MUCH AS TO SAY WELL I TOLD YOU SO

AND PLEASE WHATS HULKS SAID I

THATS THE WAY WITH THIS BOY EXCLAIMED MY SISTER POINTING ME OUT
WITH HER NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SHAKING HER HEAD AT ME ANSWER HIM ONE
QUESTION AND HELL ASK YOU A DOZEN DIRECTLY HULKS ARE PRISONSHIPS
RIGHT CROSS TH MESHES WE ALWAYS USED THAT NAME FOR MARSHES IN OUR
COUNTRY

I WONDER WHOS PUT INTO PRISONSHIPS AND WHY THEYRE PUT THERE SAID
I IN A GENERAL WAY AND WITH QUIET DESPERATION

IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR MRS JOE WHO IMMEDIATELY ROSE I TELL YOU WHAT
YOUNG FELLOW SAID SHE I DIDNT BRING YOU UP BY HAND TO BADGER
PEOPLES LIVES OUT IT WOULD BE BLAME TO ME AND NOT PRAISE IF I HAD
PEOPLE ARE PUT IN THE HULKS BECAUSE THEY MURDER AND BECAUSE THEY ROB
AND FORGE AND DO ALL SORTS OF BAD AND THEY ALWAYS BEGIN BY ASKING
QUESTIONS NOW YOU GET ALONG TO BED

I WAS NEVER ALLOWED A CANDLE TO LIGHT ME TO BED AND AS I WENT
UPSTAIRS IN THE DARK WITH MY HEAD TINGLINGFROM MRS JOES THIMBLE
HAVING PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE UPON IT TO ACCOMPANY HER LAST WORDSI
FELT FEARFULLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT CONVENIENCE THAT THE HULKS WERE
HANDY FOR ME I WAS CLEARLY ON MY WAY THERE I HAD BEGUN BY ASKING
QUESTIONS AND I WAS GOING TO ROB MRS JOE

SINCE THAT TIME WHICH IS FAR ENOUGH AWAY NOW I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT
THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT SECRECY THERE IS IN THE YOUNG UNDER TERROR
NO MATTER HOW UNREASONABLE THE TERROR SO THAT IT BE TERROR I WAS IN
MORTAL TERROR OF THE YOUNG MAN WHO WANTED MY HEART AND LIVER I WAS IN
MORTAL TERROR OF MY INTERLOCUTOR WITH THE IRON LEG I WAS IN MORTAL
TERROR OF MYSELF FROM WHOM AN AWFUL PROMISE HAD BEEN EXTRACTED I HAD
NO HOPE OF DELIVERANCE THROUGH MY ALLPOWERFUL SISTER WHO REPULSED ME
AT EVERY TURN I AM AFRAID TO THINK OF WHAT I MIGHT HAVE DONE ON
REQUIREMENT IN THE SECRECY OF MY TERROR

IF I SLEPT AT ALL THAT NIGHT IT WAS ONLY TO IMAGINE MYSELF DRIFTING
DOWN THE RIVER ON A STRONG SPRINGTIDE TO THE HULKS A GHOSTLY PIRATE
CALLING OUT TO ME THROUGH A SPEAKINGTRUMPET AS I PASSED THE
GIBBETSTATION THAT I HAD BETTER COME ASHORE AND BE HANGED THERE AT
ONCE AND NOT PUT IT OFF I WAS AFRAID TO SLEEP EVEN IF I HAD BEEN
INCLINED FOR I KNEW THAT AT THE FIRST FAINT DAWN OF MORNING I MUST ROB
THE PANTRY THERE WAS NO DOING IT IN THE NIGHT FOR THERE WAS NO
GETTING A LIGHT BY EASY FRICTION THEN TO HAVE GOT ONE I MUST HAVE
STRUCK IT OUT OF FLINT AND STEEL AND HAVE MADE A NOISE LIKE THE VERY
PIRATE HIMSELF RATTLING HIS CHAINS

AS SOON AS THE GREAT BLACK VELVET PALL OUTSIDE MY LITTLE WINDOW WAS
SHOT WITH GREY I GOT UP AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS EVERY BOARD UPON THE WAY
AND EVERY CRACK IN EVERY BOARD CALLING AFTER ME STOP THIEF AND GET
UP MRS JOE IN THE PANTRY WHICH WAS FAR MORE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED
THAN USUAL OWING TO THE SEASON I WAS VERY MUCH ALARMED BY A HARE
HANGING UP BY THE HEELS WHOM I RATHER THOUGHT I CAUGHT WHEN MY BACK
WAS HALF TURNED WINKING I HAD NO TIME FOR VERIFICATION NO TIME FOR
SELECTION NO TIME FOR ANYTHING FOR I HAD NO TIME TO SPARE I STOLE
SOME BREAD SOME RIND OF CHEESE ABOUT HALF A JAR OF MINCEMEAT WHICH I
TIED UP IN MY POCKETHANDKERCHIEF WITH MY LAST NIGHTS SLICE SOME
BRANDY FROM A STONE BOTTLE WHICH I DECANTED INTO A GLASS BOTTLE I HAD
SECRETLY USED FOR MAKING THAT INTOXICATING FLUID
SPANISHLIQUORICEWATER UP IN MY ROOM DILUTING THE STONE BOTTLE FROM
A JUG IN THE KITCHEN CUPBOARD A MEAT BONE WITH VERY LITTLE ON IT AND
A BEAUTIFUL ROUND COMPACT PORK PIE I WAS NEARLY GOING AWAY WITHOUT THE
PIE BUT I WAS TEMPTED TO MOUNT UPON A SHELF TO LOOK WHAT IT WAS THAT
WAS PUT AWAY SO CAREFULLY IN A COVERED EARTHENWARE DISH IN A CORNER
AND I FOUND IT WAS THE PIE AND I TOOK IT IN THE HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT
INTENDED FOR EARLY USE AND WOULD NOT BE MISSED FOR SOME TIME

THERE WAS A DOOR IN THE KITCHEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE FORGE I
UNLOCKED AND UNBOLTED THAT DOOR AND GOT A FILE FROM AMONG JOES TOOLS
THEN I PUT THE FASTENINGS AS I HAD FOUND THEM OPENED THE DOOR AT WHICH
I HAD ENTERED WHEN I RAN HOME LAST NIGHT SHUT IT AND RAN FOR THE
MISTY MARSHES




CHAPTER III


IT WAS A RIMY MORNING AND VERY DAMP I HAD SEEN THE DAMP LYING ON THE
OUTSIDE OF MY LITTLE WINDOW AS IF SOME GOBLIN HAD BEEN CRYING THERE
ALL NIGHT AND USING THE WINDOW FOR A POCKETHANDKERCHIEF NOW I SAW
THE DAMP LYING ON THE BARE HEDGES AND SPARE GRASS LIKE A COARSER SORT
OF SPIDERS WEBS HANGING ITSELF FROM TWIG TO TWIG AND BLADE TO BLADE
ON EVERY RAIL AND GATE WET LAY CLAMMY AND THE MARSH MIST WAS SO
THICK THAT THE WOODEN FINGER ON THE POST DIRECTING PEOPLE TO OUR
VILLAGEA DIRECTION WHICH THEY NEVER ACCEPTED FOR THEY NEVER CAME
THEREWAS INVISIBLE TO ME UNTIL I WAS QUITE CLOSE UNDER IT THEN AS I
LOOKED UP AT IT WHILE IT DRIPPED IT SEEMED TO MY OPPRESSED CONSCIENCE
LIKE A PHANTOM DEVOTING ME TO THE HULKS

THE MIST WAS HEAVIER YET WHEN I GOT OUT UPON THE MARSHES SO THAT
INSTEAD OF MY RUNNING AT EVERYTHING EVERYTHING SEEMED TO RUN AT ME
THIS WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE TO A GUILTY MIND THE GATES AND DIKES AND
BANKS CAME BURSTING AT ME THROUGH THE MIST AS IF THEY CRIED AS PLAINLY
AS COULD BE A BOY WITH SOMEBODY ELSES PORK PIE STOP HIM THE
CATTLE CAME UPON ME WITH LIKE SUDDENNESS STARING OUT OF THEIR EYES
AND STEAMING OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS HALLOA YOUNG THIEF ONE BLACK
OX WITH A WHITE CRAVAT ONWHO EVEN HAD TO MY AWAKENED CONSCIENCE
SOMETHING OF A CLERICAL AIRFIXED ME SO OBSTINATELY WITH HIS EYES AND
MOVED HIS BLUNT HEAD ROUND IN SUCH AN ACCUSATORY MANNER AS I MOVED
ROUND THAT I BLUBBERED OUT TO HIM I COULDNT HELP IT SIR IT WASNT
FOR MYSELF I TOOK IT UPON WHICH HE PUT DOWN HIS HEAD BLEW A CLOUD OF
SMOKE OUT OF HIS NOSE AND VANISHED WITH A KICKUP OF HIS HINDLEGS AND
A FLOURISH OF HIS TAIL

ALL THIS TIME I WAS GETTING ON TOWARDS THE RIVER BUT HOWEVER FAST I
WENT I COULDNT WARM MY FEET TO WHICH THE DAMP COLD SEEMED RIVETED
AS THE IRON WAS RIVETED TO THE LEG OF THE MAN I WAS RUNNING TO MEET I
KNEW MY WAY TO THE BATTERY PRETTY STRAIGHT FOR I HAD BEEN DOWN THERE
ON A SUNDAY WITH JOE AND JOE SITTING ON AN OLD GUN HAD TOLD ME THAT
WHEN I WAS PRENTICE TO HIM REGULARLY BOUND WE WOULD HAVE SUCH LARKS
THERE HOWEVER IN THE CONFUSION OF THE MIST I FOUND MYSELF AT LAST
TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO TRY BACK ALONG THE
RIVERSIDE ON THE BANK OF LOOSE STONES ABOVE THE MUD AND THE STAKES
THAT STAKED THE TIDE OUT MAKING MY WAY ALONG HERE WITH ALL DESPATCH I
HAD JUST CROSSED A DITCH WHICH I KNEW TO BE VERY NEAR THE BATTERY AND
HAD JUST SCRAMBLED UP THE MOUND BEYOND THE DITCH WHEN I SAW THE MAN
SITTING BEFORE ME HIS BACK WAS TOWARDS ME AND HE HAD HIS ARMS FOLDED
AND WAS NODDING FORWARD HEAVY WITH SLEEP

I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE MORE GLAD IF I CAME UPON HIM WITH HIS BREAKFAST
IN THAT UNEXPECTED MANNER SO I WENT FORWARD SOFTLY AND TOUCHED HIM ON
THE SHOULDER HE INSTANTLY JUMPED UP AND IT WAS NOT THE SAME MAN BUT
ANOTHER MAN

AND YET THIS MAN WAS DRESSED IN COARSE GREY TOO AND HAD A GREAT IRON
ON HIS LEG AND WAS LAME AND HOARSE AND COLD AND WAS EVERYTHING THAT
THE OTHER MAN WAS EXCEPT THAT HE HAD NOT THE SAME FACE AND HAD A FLAT
BROADBRIMMED LOWCROWNED FELT HAT ON ALL THIS I SAW IN A MOMENT FOR
I HAD ONLY A MOMENT TO SEE IT IN HE SWORE AN OATH AT ME MADE A HIT AT
MEIT WAS A ROUND WEAK BLOW THAT MISSED ME AND ALMOST KNOCKED HIMSELF
DOWN FOR IT MADE HIM STUMBLEAND THEN HE RAN INTO THE MIST STUMBLING
TWICE AS HE WENT AND I LOST HIM

ITS THE YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT FEELING MY HEART SHOOT AS I IDENTIFIED
HIM I DARE SAY I SHOULD HAVE FELT A PAIN IN MY LIVER TOO IF I HAD
KNOWN WHERE IT WAS

I WAS SOON AT THE BATTERY AFTER THAT AND THERE WAS THE RIGHT
MANHUGGING HIMSELF AND LIMPING TO AND FRO AS IF HE HAD NEVER ALL
NIGHT LEFT OFF HUGGING AND LIMPINGWAITING FOR ME HE WAS AWFULLY
COLD TO BE SURE I HALF EXPECTED TO SEE HIM DROP DOWN BEFORE MY FACE
AND DIE OF DEADLY COLD HIS EYES LOOKED SO AWFULLY HUNGRY TOO THAT
WHEN I HANDED HIM THE FILE AND HE LAID IT DOWN ON THE GRASS IT
OCCURRED TO ME HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO EAT IT IF HE HAD NOT SEEN MY
BUNDLE HE DID NOT TURN ME UPSIDE DOWN THIS TIME TO GET AT WHAT I HAD
BUT LEFT ME RIGHT SIDE UPWARDS WHILE I OPENED THE BUNDLE AND EMPTIED MY
POCKETS

WHATS IN THE BOTTLE BOY SAID HE

BRANDY SAID I

HE WAS ALREADY HANDING MINCEMEAT DOWN HIS THROAT IN THE MOST CURIOUS
MANNERMORE LIKE A MAN WHO WAS PUTTING IT AWAY SOMEWHERE IN A VIOLENT
HURRY THAN A MAN WHO WAS EATING ITBUT HE LEFT OFF TO TAKE SOME OF
THE LIQUOR HE SHIVERED ALL THE WHILE SO VIOLENTLY THAT IT WAS QUITE
AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO TO KEEP THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE BETWEEN HIS
TEETH WITHOUT BITING IT OFF

I THINK YOU HAVE GOT THE AGUE SAID I

IM MUCH OF YOUR OPINION BOY SAID HE

ITS BAD ABOUT HERE I TOLD HIM YOUVE BEEN LYING OUT ON THE
MESHES AND THEYRE DREADFUL AGUISH RHEUMATIC TOO

ILL EAT MY BREAKFAST AFORE THEYRE THE DEATH OF ME SAID HE ID DO
THAT IF I WAS GOING TO BE STRUNG UP TO THAT THERE GALLOWS AS THERE IS
OVER THERE DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS ILL BEAT THE SHIVERS SO FAR ILL BET
YOU

HE WAS GOBBLING MINCEMEAT MEATBONE BREAD CHEESE AND PORK PIE ALL
AT ONCE STARING DISTRUSTFULLY WHILE HE DID SO AT THE MIST ALL ROUND
US AND OFTEN STOPPINGEVEN STOPPING HIS JAWSTO LISTEN SOME REAL OR
FANCIED SOUND SOME CLINK UPON THE RIVER OR BREATHING OF BEAST UPON THE
MARSH NOW GAVE HIM A START AND HE SAID SUDDENLY

YOURE NOT A DECEIVING IMP YOU BROUGHT NO ONE WITH YOU

NO SIR NO

NOR GIV NO ONE THE OFFICE TO FOLLOW YOU

NO

WELL SAID HE I BELIEVE YOU YOUD BE BUT A FIERCE YOUNG HOUND
INDEED IF AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE YOU COULD HELP TO HUNT A WRETCHED
WARMINT HUNTED AS NEAR DEATH AND DUNGHILL AS THIS POOR WRETCHED WARMINT
IS

SOMETHING CLICKED IN HIS THROAT AS IF HE HAD WORKS IN HIM LIKE A CLOCK
AND WAS GOING TO STRIKE AND HE SMEARED HIS RAGGED ROUGH SLEEVE OVER
HIS EYES

PITYING HIS DESOLATION AND WATCHING HIM AS HE GRADUALLY SETTLED DOWN
UPON THE PIE I MADE BOLD TO SAY I AM GLAD YOU ENJOY IT

DID YOU SPEAK

I SAID I WAS GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT

THANKEE MY BOY I DO

I HAD OFTEN WATCHED A LARGE DOG OF OURS EATING HIS FOOD AND I NOW
NOTICED A DECIDED SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE DOGS WAY OF EATING AND THE
MANS THE MAN TOOK STRONG SHARP SUDDEN BITES JUST LIKE THE DOG HE
SWALLOWED OR RATHER SNAPPED UP EVERY MOUTHFUL TOO SOON AND TOO FAST
AND HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS HERE AND THERE WHILE HE ATE AS IF HE THOUGHT
THERE WAS DANGER IN EVERY DIRECTION OF SOMEBODYS COMING TO TAKE THE
PIE AWAY HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO UNSETTLED IN HIS MIND OVER IT TO
APPRECIATE IT COMFORTABLY I THOUGHT OR TO HAVE ANYBODY TO DINE WITH
HIM WITHOUT MAKING A CHOP WITH HIS JAWS AT THE VISITOR IN ALL OF
WHICH PARTICULARS HE WAS VERY LIKE THE DOG

I AM AFRAID YOU WONT LEAVE ANY OF IT FOR HIM SAID I TIMIDLY AFTER
A SILENCE DURING WHICH I HAD HESITATED AS TO THE POLITENESS OF MAKING
THE REMARK THERES NO MORE TO BE GOT WHERE THAT CAME FROM IT WAS
THE CERTAINTY OF THIS FACT THAT IMPELLED ME TO OFFER THE HINT

LEAVE ANY FOR HIM WHOS HIM SAID MY FRIEND STOPPING IN HIS
CRUNCHING OF PIECRUST

THE YOUNG MAN THAT YOU SPOKE OF THAT WAS HID WITH YOU

OH AH HE RETURNED WITH SOMETHING LIKE A GRUFF LAUGH HIM YES
YES HE DONT WANT NO WITTLES

I THOUGHT HE LOOKED AS IF HE DID SAID I

THE MAN STOPPED EATING AND REGARDED ME WITH THE KEENEST SCRUTINY AND
THE GREATEST SURPRISE

LOOKED WHEN

JUST NOW

WHERE

YONDER SAID I POINTING OVER THERE WHERE I FOUND HIM NODDING
ASLEEP AND THOUGHT IT WAS YOU

HE HELD ME BY THE COLLAR AND STARED AT ME SO THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HIS
FIRST IDEA ABOUT CUTTING MY THROAT HAD REVIVED

DRESSED LIKE YOU YOU KNOW ONLY WITH A HAT I EXPLAINED TREMBLING
ANDANDI WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO PUT THIS DELICATELYAND WITHTHE SAME
REASON FOR WANTING TO BORROW A FILE DIDNT YOU HEAR THE CANNON LAST
NIGHT

THEN THERE WAS FIRING HE SAID TO HIMSELF

I WONDER YOU SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN SURE OF THAT I RETURNED FOR WE
HEARD IT UP AT HOME AND THATS FARTHER AWAY AND WE WERE SHUT IN
BESIDES

WHY SEE NOW SAID HE WHEN A MANS ALONE ON THESE FLATS WITH A
LIGHT HEAD AND A LIGHT STOMACH PERISHING OF COLD AND WANT HE HEARS
NOTHIN ALL NIGHT BUT GUNS FIRING AND VOICES CALLING HEARS HE SEES
THE SOLDIERS WITH THEIR RED COATS LIGHTED UP BY THE TORCHES CARRIED
AFORE CLOSING IN ROUND HIM HEARS HIS NUMBER CALLED HEARS HIMSELF
CHALLENGED HEARS THE RATTLE OF THE MUSKETS HEARS THE ORDERS MAKE
READY PRESENT COVER HIM STEADY MEN AND IS LAID HANDS ONAND
THERES NOTHIN WHY IF I SEE ONE PURSUING PARTY LAST NIGHTCOMING UP
IN ORDER DAMN EM WITH THEIR TRAMP TRAMPI SEE A HUNDRED AND AS TO
FIRING WHY I SEE THE MIST SHAKE WITH THE CANNON ARTER IT WAS BROAD
DAYBUT THIS MAN HE HAD SAID ALL THE REST AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN MY
BEING THERE DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING IN HIM

HE HAD A BADLY BRUISED FACE SAID I RECALLING WHAT I HARDLY KNEW I
KNEW

NOT HERE EXCLAIMED THE MAN STRIKING HIS LEFT CHEEK MERCILESSLY
WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND

YES THERE

WHERE IS HE HE CRAMMED WHAT LITTLE FOOD WAS LEFT INTO THE BREAST OF
HIS GREY JACKET SHOW ME THE WAY HE WENT ILL PULL HIM DOWN LIKE A
BLOODHOUND CURSE THIS IRON ON MY SORE LEG GIVE US HOLD OF THE FILE
BOY

I INDICATED IN WHAT DIRECTION THE MIST HAD SHROUDED THE OTHER MAN AND
HE LOOKED UP AT IT FOR AN INSTANT BUT HE WAS DOWN ON THE RANK WET
GRASS FILING AT HIS IRON LIKE A MADMAN AND NOT MINDING ME OR MINDING
HIS OWN LEG WHICH HAD AN OLD CHAFE UPON IT AND WAS BLOODY BUT WHICH
HE HANDLED AS ROUGHLY AS IF IT HAD NO MORE FEELING IN IT THAN THE FILE
I WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF HIM AGAIN NOW THAT HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF
INTO THIS FIERCE HURRY AND I WAS LIKEWISE VERY MUCH AFRAID OF KEEPING
AWAY FROM HOME ANY LONGER I TOLD HIM I MUST GO BUT HE TOOK NO NOTICE
SO I THOUGHT THE BEST THING I COULD DO WAS TO SLIP OFF THE LAST I SAW
OF HIM HIS HEAD WAS BENT OVER HIS KNEE AND HE WAS WORKING HARD AT HIS
FETTER MUTTERING IMPATIENT IMPRECATIONS AT IT AND AT HIS LEG THE LAST
I HEARD OF HIM I STOPPED IN THE MIST TO LISTEN AND THE FILE WAS STILL
GOING




CHAPTER IV


I FULLY EXPECTED TO FIND A CONSTABLE IN THE KITCHEN WAITING TO TAKE ME
UP BUT NOT ONLY WAS THERE NO CONSTABLE THERE BUT NO DISCOVERY HAD YET
BEEN MADE OF THE ROBBERY MRS JOE WAS PRODIGIOUSLY BUSY IN GETTING THE
HOUSE READY FOR THE FESTIVITIES OF THE DAY AND JOE HAD BEEN PUT UPON
THE KITCHEN DOORSTEP TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE DUSTPANAN ARTICLE INTO
WHICH HIS DESTINY ALWAYS LED HIM SOONER OR LATER WHEN MY SISTER WAS
VIGOROUSLY REAPING THE FLOORS OF HER ESTABLISHMENT

AND WHERE THE DEUCE HA YOU BEEN WAS MRS JOES CHRISTMAS
SALUTATION WHEN I AND MY CONSCIENCE SHOWED OURSELVES

I SAID I HAD BEEN DOWN TO HEAR THE CAROLS AH WELL OBSERVED MRS
JOE YOU MIGHT HA DONE WORSE NOT A DOUBT OF THAT I THOUGHT

PERHAPS IF I WARNT A BLACKSMITHS WIFE AND WHATS THE SAME THING A
SLAVE WITH HER APRON NEVER OFF I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO HEAR THE
CAROLS SAID MRS JOE IM RATHER PARTIAL TO CAROLS MYSELF AND
THATS THE BEST OF REASONS FOR MY NEVER HEARING ANY

JOE WHO HAD VENTURED INTO THE KITCHEN AFTER ME AS THE DUSTPAN HAD
RETIRED BEFORE US DREW THE BACK OF HIS HAND ACROSS HIS NOSE WITH A
CONCILIATORY AIR WHEN MRS JOE DARTED A LOOK AT HIM AND WHEN HER
EYES WERE WITHDRAWN SECRETLY CROSSED HIS TWO FOREFINGERS AND
EXHIBITED THEM TO ME AS OUR TOKEN THAT MRS JOE WAS IN A CROSS TEMPER
THIS WAS SO MUCH HER NORMAL STATE THAT JOE AND I WOULD OFTEN FOR
WEEKS TOGETHER BE AS TO OUR FINGERS LIKE MONUMENTAL CRUSADERS AS TO
THEIR LEGS

WE WERE TO HAVE A SUPERB DINNER CONSISTING OF A LEG OF PICKLED PORK
AND GREENS AND A PAIR OF ROAST STUFFED FOWLS A HANDSOME MINCEPIE HAD
BEEN MADE YESTERDAY MORNING WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE MINCEMEAT NOT
BEING MISSED AND THE PUDDING WAS ALREADY ON THE BOIL THESE EXTENSIVE
ARRANGEMENTS OCCASIONED US TO BE CUT OFF UNCEREMONIOUSLY IN RESPECT OF
BREAKFAST FOR I AINT SAID MRS JOEI AINT AGOING TO HAVE NO
FORMAL CRAMMING AND BUSTING AND WASHING UP NOW WITH WHAT IVE GOT
BEFORE ME I PROMISE YOU

SO WE HAD OUR SLICES SERVED OUT AS IF WE WERE TWO THOUSAND TROOPS ON
A FORCED MARCH INSTEAD OF A MAN AND BOY AT HOME AND WE TOOK GULPS OF
MILK AND WATER WITH APOLOGETIC COUNTENANCES FROM A JUG ON THE
DRESSER IN THE MEANTIME MRS JOE PUT CLEAN WHITE CURTAINS UP AND
TACKED A NEW FLOWERED FLOUNCE ACROSS THE WIDE CHIMNEY TO REPLACE THE
OLD ONE AND UNCOVERED THE LITTLE STATE PARLOUR ACROSS THE PASSAGE
WHICH WAS NEVER UNCOVERED AT ANY OTHER TIME BUT PASSED THE REST OF THE
YEAR IN A COOL HAZE OF SILVER PAPER WHICH EVEN EXTENDED TO THE FOUR
LITTLE WHITE CROCKERY POODLES ON THE MANTELSHELF EACH WITH A BLACK
NOSE AND A BASKET OF FLOWERS IN HIS MOUTH AND EACH THE COUNTERPART OF
THE OTHER MRS JOE WAS A VERY CLEAN HOUSEKEEPER BUT HAD AN EXQUISITE
ART OF MAKING HER CLEANLINESS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE THAN
DIRT ITSELF CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS AND SOME PEOPLE DO THE
SAME BY THEIR RELIGION

MY SISTER HAVING SO MUCH TO DO WAS GOING TO CHURCH VICARIOUSLY THAT
IS TO SAY JOE AND I WERE GOING IN HIS WORKINGCLOTHES JOE WAS A
WELLKNIT CHARACTERISTICLOOKING BLACKSMITH IN HIS HOLIDAY CLOTHES HE
WAS MORE LIKE A SCARECROW IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAN ANYTHING ELSE
NOTHING THAT HE WORE THEN FITTED HIM OR SEEMED TO BELONG TO HIM AND
EVERYTHING THAT HE WORE THEN GRAZED HIM ON THE PRESENT FESTIVE
OCCASION HE EMERGED FROM HIS ROOM WHEN THE BLITHE BELLS WERE GOING
THE PICTURE OF MISERY IN A FULL SUIT OF SUNDAY PENITENTIALS AS TO ME
I THINK MY SISTER MUST HAVE HAD SOME GENERAL IDEA THAT I WAS A YOUNG
OFFENDER WHOM AN ACCOUCHEUR POLICEMAN HAD TAKEN UP ON MY BIRTHDAY AND
DELIVERED OVER TO HER TO BE DEALT WITH ACCORDING TO THE OUTRAGED
MAJESTY OF THE LAW I WAS ALWAYS TREATED AS IF I HAD INSISTED ON BEING
BORN IN OPPOSITION TO THE DICTATES OF REASON RELIGION AND MORALITY
AND AGAINST THE DISSUADING ARGUMENTS OF MY BEST FRIENDS EVEN WHEN I
WAS TAKEN TO HAVE A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES THE TAILOR HAD ORDERS TO MAKE
THEM LIKE A KIND OF REFORMATORY AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO LET ME HAVE THE
FREE USE OF MY LIMBS

JOE AND I GOING TO CHURCH THEREFORE MUST HAVE BEEN A MOVING SPECTACLE
FOR COMPASSIONATE MINDS YET WHAT I SUFFERED OUTSIDE WAS NOTHING TO
WHAT I UNDERWENT WITHIN THE TERRORS THAT HAD ASSAILED ME WHENEVER MRS
JOE HAD GONE NEAR THE PANTRY OR OUT OF THE ROOM WERE ONLY TO BE
EQUALLED BY THE REMORSE WITH WHICH MY MIND DWELT ON WHAT MY HANDS HAD
DONE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MY WICKED SECRET I PONDERED WHETHER THE
CHURCH WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SHIELD ME FROM THE VENGEANCE OF THE
TERRIBLE YOUNG MAN IF I DIVULGED TO THAT ESTABLISHMENT I CONCEIVED
THE IDEA THAT THE TIME WHEN THE BANNS WERE READ AND WHEN THE CLERGYMAN
SAID YE ARE NOW TO DECLARE IT WOULD BE THE TIME FOR ME TO RISE AND
PROPOSE A PRIVATE CONFERENCE IN THE VESTRY I AM FAR FROM BEING SURE
THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE ASTONISHED OUR SMALL CONGREGATION BY RESORTING TO
THIS EXTREME MEASURE BUT FOR ITS BEING CHRISTMAS DAY AND NO SUNDAY

MR WOPSLE THE CLERK AT CHURCH WAS TO DINE WITH US AND MR HUBBLE
THE WHEELWRIGHT AND MRS HUBBLE AND UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK JOES UNCLE
BUT MRS JOE APPROPRIATED HIM WHO WAS A WELLTODO CORNCHANDLER IN
THE NEAREST TOWN AND DROVE HIS OWN CHAISECART THE DINNER HOUR WAS
HALFPAST ONE WHEN JOE AND I GOT HOME WE FOUND THE TABLE LAID AND
MRS JOE DRESSED AND THE DINNER DRESSING AND THE FRONT DOOR UNLOCKED
IT NEVER WAS AT ANY OTHER TIME FOR THE COMPANY TO ENTER BY AND
EVERYTHING MOST SPLENDID AND STILL NOT A WORD OF THE ROBBERY

THE TIME CAME WITHOUT BRINGING WITH IT ANY RELIEF TO MY FEELINGS AND
THE COMPANY CAME MR WOPSLE UNITED TO A ROMAN NOSE AND A LARGE
SHINING BALD FOREHEAD HAD A DEEP VOICE WHICH HE WAS UNCOMMONLY PROUD
OF INDEED IT WAS UNDERSTOOD AMONG HIS ACQUAINTANCE THAT IF YOU COULD
ONLY GIVE HIM HIS HEAD HE WOULD READ THE CLERGYMAN INTO FITS HE
HIMSELF CONFESSED THAT IF THE CHURCH WAS THROWN OPEN MEANING TO
COMPETITION HE WOULD NOT DESPAIR OF MAKING HIS MARK IN IT THE CHURCH
NOT BEING THROWN OPEN HE WAS AS I HAVE SAID OUR CLERK BUT HE
PUNISHED THE AMENS TREMENDOUSLY AND WHEN HE GAVE OUT THE PSALMALWAYS
GIVING THE WHOLE VERSEHE LOOKED ALL ROUND THE CONGREGATION FIRST AS
MUCH AS TO SAY YOU HAVE HEARD MY FRIEND OVERHEAD OBLIGE ME WITH YOUR
OPINION OF THIS STYLE

I OPENED THE DOOR TO THE COMPANYMAKING BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A HABIT OF
OURS TO OPEN THAT DOORAND I OPENED IT FIRST TO MR WOPSLE NEXT TO
MR AND MRS HUBBLE AND LAST OF ALL TO UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK NB I WAS
NOT ALLOWED TO CALL HIM UNCLE UNDER THE SEVEREST PENALTIES

MRS JOE SAID UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK A LARGE HARDBREATHING MIDDLEAGED
SLOW MAN WITH A MOUTH LIKE A FISH DULL STARING EYES AND SANDY HAIR
STANDING UPRIGHT ON HIS HEAD SO THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST BEEN
ALL BUT CHOKED AND HAD THAT MOMENT COME TO I HAVE BROUGHT YOU AS THE
COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASONI HAVE BROUGHT YOU MUM A BOTTLE OF SHERRY
WINEAND I HAVE BROUGHT YOU MUM A BOTTLE OF PORT WINE

EVERY CHRISTMAS DAY HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A PROFOUND NOVELTY WITH
EXACTLY THE SAME WORDS AND CARRYING THE TWO BOTTLES LIKE DUMBBELLS
EVERY CHRISTMAS DAY MRS JOE REPLIED AS SHE NOW REPLIED O UNCLE
PUMBLECHOOK THIS IS KIND EVERY CHRISTMAS DAY HE RETORTED AS HE
NOW RETORTED ITS NO MORE THAN YOUR MERITS AND NOW ARE YOU ALL
BOBBISH AND HOWS SIXPENNORTH OF HALFPENCE MEANING ME

WE DINED ON THESE OCCASIONS IN THE KITCHEN AND ADJOURNED FOR THE NUTS
AND ORANGES AND APPLES TO THE PARLOUR WHICH WAS A CHANGE VERY LIKE
JOES CHANGE FROM HIS WORKINGCLOTHES TO HIS SUNDAY DRESS MY SISTER
WAS UNCOMMONLY LIVELY ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND INDEED WAS GENERALLY
MORE GRACIOUS IN THE SOCIETY OF MRS HUBBLE THAN IN OTHER COMPANY I
REMEMBER MRS HUBBLE AS A LITTLE CURLY SHARPEDGED PERSON IN SKYBLUE
WHO HELD A CONVENTIONALLY JUVENILE POSITION BECAUSE SHE HAD MARRIED
MR HUBBLEI DONT KNOW AT WHAT REMOTE PERIODWHEN SHE WAS MUCH
YOUNGER THAN HE I REMEMBER MR HUBBLE AS A TOUGH HIGHSHOULDERED
STOOPING OLD MAN OF A SAWDUSTY FRAGRANCE WITH HIS LEGS
EXTRAORDINARILY WIDE APART SO THAT IN MY SHORT DAYS I ALWAYS SAW SOME
MILES OF OPEN COUNTRY BETWEEN THEM WHEN I MET HIM COMING UP THE LANE

AMONG THIS GOOD COMPANY I SHOULD HAVE FELT MYSELF EVEN IF I HADNT
ROBBED THE PANTRY IN A FALSE POSITION NOT BECAUSE I WAS SQUEEZED IN
AT AN ACUTE ANGLE OF THE TABLECLOTH WITH THE TABLE IN MY CHEST AND
THE PUMBLECHOOKIAN ELBOW IN MY EYE NOR BECAUSE I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO
SPEAK I DIDNT WANT TO SPEAK NOR BECAUSE I WAS REGALED WITH THE
SCALY TIPS OF THE DRUMSTICKS OF THE FOWLS AND WITH THOSE OBSCURE
CORNERS OF PORK OF WHICH THE PIG WHEN LIVING HAD HAD THE LEAST REASON
TO BE VAIN NO I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED THAT IF THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE
LEFT ME ALONE BUT THEY WOULDNT LEAVE ME ALONE THEY SEEMED TO THINK
THE OPPORTUNITY LOST IF THEY FAILED TO POINT THE CONVERSATION AT ME
EVERY NOW AND THEN AND STICK THE POINT INTO ME I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN
UNFORTUNATE LITTLE BULL IN A SPANISH ARENA I GOT SO SMARTINGLY TOUCHED
UP BY THESE MORAL GOADS

IT BEGAN THE MOMENT WE SAT DOWN TO DINNER MR WOPSLE SAID GRACE WITH
THEATRICAL DECLAMATIONAS IT NOW APPEARS TO ME SOMETHING LIKE A
RELIGIOUS CROSS OF THE GHOST IN HAMLET WITH RICHARD THE THIRDAND
ENDED WITH THE VERY PROPER ASPIRATION THAT WE MIGHT BE TRULY GRATEFUL
UPON WHICH MY SISTER FIXED ME WITH HER EYE AND SAID IN A LOW
REPROACHFUL VOICE DO YOU HEAR THAT BE GRATEFUL

ESPECIALLY SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK BE GRATEFUL BOY TO THEM WHICH
BROUGHT YOU UP BY HAND

MRS HUBBLE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CONTEMPLATING ME WITH A MOURNFUL
PRESENTIMENT THAT I SHOULD COME TO NO GOOD ASKED WHY IS IT THAT THE
YOUNG ARE NEVER GRATEFUL THIS MORAL MYSTERY SEEMED TOO MUCH FOR THE
COMPANY UNTIL MR HUBBLE TERSELY SOLVED IT BY SAYING NATERALLY
WICIOUS EVERYBODY THEN MURMURED TRUE AND LOOKED AT ME IN A
PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT AND PERSONAL MANNER

JOES STATION AND INFLUENCE WERE SOMETHING FEEBLER IF POSSIBLE WHEN
THERE WAS COMPANY THAN WHEN THERE WAS NONE BUT HE ALWAYS AIDED AND
COMFORTED ME WHEN HE COULD IN SOME WAY OF HIS OWN AND HE ALWAYS DID
SO AT DINNERTIME BY GIVING ME GRAVY IF THERE WERE ANY THERE BEING
PLENTY OF GRAVY TODAY JOE SPOONED INTO MY PLATE AT THIS POINT ABOUT
HALF A PINT

A LITTLE LATER ON IN THE DINNER MR WOPSLE REVIEWED THE SERMON WITH
SOME SEVERITY AND INTIMATEDIN THE USUAL HYPOTHETICAL CASE OF THE
CHURCH BEING THROWN OPENWHAT KIND OF SERMON HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN
THEM AFTER FAVOURING THEM WITH SOME HEADS OF THAT DISCOURSE HE
REMARKED THAT HE CONSIDERED THE SUBJECT OF THE DAYS HOMILY ILL
CHOSEN WHICH WAS THE LESS EXCUSABLE HE ADDED WHEN THERE WERE SO MANY
SUBJECTS GOING ABOUT

TRUE AGAIN SAID UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK YOUVE HIT IT SIR PLENTY OF
SUBJECTS GOING ABOUT FOR THEM THAT KNOW HOW TO PUT SALT UPON THEIR
TAILS THATS WHATS WANTED A MAN NEEDNT GO FAR TO FIND A SUBJECT IF
HES READY WITH HIS SALTBOX MR PUMBLECHOOK ADDED AFTER A SHORT
INTERVAL OF REFLECTION LOOK AT PORK ALONE THERES A SUBJECT IF YOU
WANT A SUBJECT LOOK AT PORK

TRUE SIR MANY A MORAL FOR THE YOUNG RETURNED MR WOPSLEAND I
KNEW HE WAS GOING TO LUG ME IN BEFORE HE SAID IT MIGHT BE DEDUCED
FROM THAT TEXT

YOU LISTEN TO THIS SAID MY SISTER TO ME IN A SEVERE PARENTHESIS

JOE GAVE ME SOME MORE GRAVY

SWINE PURSUED MR WOPSLE IN HIS DEEPEST VOICE AND POINTING HIS
FORK AT MY BLUSHES AS IF HE WERE MENTIONING MY CHRISTIAN NAMESWINE
WERE THE COMPANIONS OF THE PRODIGAL THE GLUTTONY OF SWINE IS PUT
BEFORE US AS AN EXAMPLE TO THE YOUNG I THOUGHT THIS PRETTY WELL IN
HIM WHO HAD BEEN PRAISING UP THE PORK FOR BEING SO PLUMP AND JUICY
WHAT IS DETESTABLE IN A PIG IS MORE DETESTABLE IN A BOY

OR GIRL SUGGESTED MR HUBBLE

OF COURSE OR GIRL MR HUBBLE ASSENTED MR WOPSLE RATHER
IRRITABLY BUT THERE IS NO GIRL PRESENT

BESIDES SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK TURNING SHARP ON ME THINK WHAT
YOUVE GOT TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IF YOUD BEEN BORN A SQUEAKER

HE WAS IF EVER A CHILD WAS SAID MY SISTER MOST EMPHATICALLY

JOE GAVE ME SOME MORE GRAVY

WELL BUT I MEAN A FOURFOOTED SQUEAKER SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK IF
YOU HAD BEEN BORN SUCH WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN HERE NOW NOT YOU

UNLESS IN THAT FORM SAID MR WOPSLE NODDING TOWARDS THE DISH

BUT I DONT MEAN IN THAT FORM SIR RETURNED MR PUMBLECHOOK WHO HAD
AN OBJECTION TO BEING INTERRUPTED I MEAN ENJOYING HIMSELF WITH HIS
ELDERS AND BETTERS AND IMPROVING HIMSELF WITH THEIR CONVERSATION AND
ROLLING IN THE LAP OF LUXURY WOULD HE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT NO HE
WOULDNT AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR DESTINATION TURNING ON ME
AGAIN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF FOR SO MANY SHILLINGS ACCORDING
TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE ARTICLE AND DUNSTABLE THE BUTCHER WOULD
HAVE COME UP TO YOU AS YOU LAY IN YOUR STRAW AND HE WOULD HAVE WHIPPED
YOU UNDER HIS LEFT ARM AND WITH HIS RIGHT HE WOULD HAVE TUCKED UP HIS
FROCK TO GET A PENKNIFE FROM OUT OF HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET AND HE WOULD
HAVE SHED YOUR BLOOD AND HAD YOUR LIFE NO BRINGING UP BY HAND THEN
NOT A BIT OF IT

JOE OFFERED ME MORE GRAVY WHICH I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE

HE WAS A WORLD OF TROUBLE TO YOU MAAM SAID MRS HUBBLE
COMMISERATING MY SISTER

TROUBLE ECHOED MY SISTER TROUBLE AND THEN ENTERED ON A FEARFUL
CATALOGUE OF ALL THE ILLNESSES I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF AND ALL THE ACTS
OF SLEEPLESSNESS I HAD COMMITTED AND ALL THE HIGH PLACES I HAD TUMBLED
FROM AND ALL THE LOW PLACES I HAD TUMBLED INTO AND ALL THE INJURIES I
HAD DONE MYSELF AND ALL THE TIMES SHE HAD WISHED ME IN MY GRAVE AND I
HAD CONTUMACIOUSLY REFUSED TO GO THERE

I THINK THE ROMANS MUST HAVE AGGRAVATED ONE ANOTHER VERY MUCH WITH
THEIR NOSES PERHAPS THEY BECAME THE RESTLESS PEOPLE THEY WERE IN
CONSEQUENCE ANYHOW MR WOPSLES ROMAN NOSE SO AGGRAVATED ME DURING
THE RECITAL OF MY MISDEMEANOURS THAT I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO PULL IT
UNTIL HE HOWLED BUT ALL I HAD ENDURED UP TO THIS TIME WAS NOTHING IN
COMPARISON WITH THE AWFUL FEELINGS THAT TOOK POSSESSION OF ME WHEN THE
PAUSE WAS BROKEN WHICH ENSUED UPON MY SISTERS RECITAL AND IN WHICH
PAUSE EVERYBODY HAD LOOKED AT ME AS I FELT PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS WITH
INDIGNATION AND ABHORRENCE

YET SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK LEADING THE COMPANY GENTLY BACK TO THE
THEME FROM WHICH THEY HAD STRAYED PORKREGARDED AS BILEDIS RICH
TOO AINT IT

HAVE A LITTLE BRANDY UNCLE SAID MY SISTER

O HEAVENS IT HAD COME AT LAST HE WOULD FIND IT WAS WEAK HE WOULD SAY
IT WAS WEAK AND I WAS LOST I HELD TIGHT TO THE LEG OF THE TABLE UNDER
THE CLOTH WITH BOTH HANDS AND AWAITED MY FATE

MY SISTER WENT FOR THE STONE BOTTLE CAME BACK WITH THE STONE BOTTLE
AND POURED HIS BRANDY OUT NO ONE ELSE TAKING ANY THE WRETCHED MAN
TRIFLED WITH HIS GLASSTOOK IT UP LOOKED AT IT THROUGH THE LIGHT PUT
IT DOWNPROLONGED MY MISERY ALL THIS TIME MRS JOE AND JOE WERE
BRISKLY CLEARING THE TABLE FOR THE PIE AND PUDDING

I COULDNT KEEP MY EYES OFF HIM ALWAYS HOLDING TIGHT BY THE LEG OF THE
TABLE WITH MY HANDS AND FEET I SAW THE MISERABLE CREATURE FINGER HIS
GLASS PLAYFULLY TAKE IT UP SMILE THROW HIS HEAD BACK AND DRINK THE
BRANDY OFF INSTANTLY AFTERWARDS THE COMPANY WERE SEIZED WITH
UNSPEAKABLE CONSTERNATION OWING TO HIS SPRINGING TO HIS FEET TURNING
ROUND SEVERAL TIMES IN AN APPALLING SPASMODIC WHOOPINGCOUGH DANCE AND
RUSHING OUT AT THE DOOR HE THEN BECAME VISIBLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
VIOLENTLY PLUNGING AND EXPECTORATING MAKING THE MOST HIDEOUS FACES
AND APPARENTLY OUT OF HIS MIND

I HELD ON TIGHT WHILE MRS JOE AND JOE RAN TO HIM I DIDNT KNOW HOW I
HAD DONE IT BUT I HAD NO DOUBT I HAD MURDERED HIM SOMEHOW IN MY
DREADFUL SITUATION IT WAS A RELIEF WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT BACK AND
SURVEYING THE COMPANY ALL ROUND AS IF THEY HAD DISAGREED WITH HIM
SANK DOWN INTO HIS CHAIR WITH THE ONE SIGNIFICANT GASP TAR

I HAD FILLED UP THE BOTTLE FROM THE TARWATER JUG I KNEW HE WOULD BE
WORSE BY AND BY I MOVED THE TABLE LIKE A MEDIUM OF THE PRESENT DAY
BY THE VIGOR OF MY UNSEEN HOLD UPON IT

TAR CRIED MY SISTER IN AMAZEMENT WHY HOW EVER COULD TAR COME
THERE

BUT UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK WHO WAS OMNIPOTENT IN THAT KITCHEN WOULDNT
HEAR THE WORD WOULDNT HEAR OF THE SUBJECT IMPERIOUSLY WAVED IT ALL
AWAY WITH HIS HAND AND ASKED FOR HOT GIN AND WATER MY SISTER WHO HAD
BEGUN TO BE ALARMINGLY MEDITATIVE HAD TO EMPLOY HERSELF ACTIVELY IN
GETTING THE GIN THE HOT WATER THE SUGAR AND THE LEMONPEEL AND
MIXING THEM FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST I WAS SAVED I STILL HELD ON
TO THE LEG OF THE TABLE BUT CLUTCHED IT NOW WITH THE FERVOR OF
GRATITUDE

BY DEGREES I BECAME CALM ENOUGH TO RELEASE MY GRASP AND PARTAKE OF
PUDDING MR PUMBLECHOOK PARTOOK OF PUDDING ALL PARTOOK OF PUDDING
THE COURSE TERMINATED AND MR PUMBLECHOOK HAD BEGUN TO BEAM UNDER THE
GENIAL INFLUENCE OF GIN AND WATER I BEGAN TO THINK I SHOULD GET OVER
THE DAY WHEN MY SISTER SAID TO JOE CLEAN PLATESCOLD

I CLUTCHED THE LEG OF THE TABLE AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AND PRESSED IT TO MY
BOSOM AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE COMPANION OF MY YOUTH AND FRIEND OF MY
SOUL I FORESAW WHAT WAS COMING AND I FELT THAT THIS TIME I REALLY WAS
GONE

YOU MUST TASTE SAID MY SISTER ADDRESSING THE GUESTS WITH HER BEST
GRACEYOU MUST TASTE TO FINISH WITH SUCH A DELIGHTFUL AND DELICIOUS
PRESENT OF UNCLE PUMBLECHOOKS

MUST THEY LET THEM NOT HOPE TO TASTE IT

YOU MUST KNOW SAID MY SISTER RISING ITS A PIE A SAVORY PORK
PIE

THE COMPANY MURMURED THEIR COMPLIMENTS UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK SENSIBLE OF
HAVING DESERVED WELL OF HIS FELLOWCREATURES SAIDQUITE VIVACIOUSLY
ALL THINGS CONSIDEREDWELL MRS JOE WELL DO OUR BEST ENDEAVOURS
LET US HAVE A CUT AT THIS SAME PIE

MY SISTER WENT OUT TO GET IT I HEARD HER STEPS PROCEED TO THE PANTRY
I SAW MR PUMBLECHOOK BALANCE HIS KNIFE I SAW REAWAKENING APPETITE IN
THE ROMAN NOSTRILS OF MR WOPSLE I HEARD MR HUBBLE REMARK THAT A BIT
OF SAVORY PORK PIE WOULD LAY ATOP OF ANYTHING YOU COULD MENTION AND DO
NO HARM AND I HEARD JOE SAY YOU SHALL HAVE SOME PIP I HAVE NEVER
BEEN ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WHETHER I UTTERED A SHRILL YELL OF TERROR
MERELY IN SPIRIT OR IN THE BODILY HEARING OF THE COMPANY I FELT THAT
I COULD BEAR NO MORE AND THAT I MUST RUN AWAY I RELEASED THE LEG OF
THE TABLE AND RAN FOR MY LIFE

BUT I RAN NO FARTHER THAN THE HOUSE DOOR FOR THERE I RAN HEADFOREMOST
INTO A PARTY OF SOLDIERS WITH THEIR MUSKETS ONE OF WHOM HELD OUT A
PAIR OF HANDCUFFS TO ME SAYING HERE YOU ARE LOOK SHARP COME ON




CHAPTER V


THE APPARITION OF A FILE OF SOLDIERS RINGING DOWN THE BUTENDS OF THEIR
LOADED MUSKETS ON OUR DOORSTEP CAUSED THE DINNERPARTY TO RISE FROM
TABLE IN CONFUSION AND CAUSED MRS JOE REENTERING THE KITCHEN
EMPTYHANDED TO STOP SHORT AND STARE IN HER WONDERING LAMENT OF
GRACIOUS GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME WHATS GONEWITH THEPIE

THE SERGEANT AND I WERE IN THE KITCHEN WHEN MRS JOE STOOD STARING AT
WHICH CRISIS I PARTIALLY RECOVERED THE USE OF MY SENSES IT WAS THE
SERGEANT WHO HAD SPOKEN TO ME AND HE WAS NOW LOOKING ROUND AT THE
COMPANY WITH HIS HANDCUFFS INVITINGLY EXTENDED TOWARDS THEM IN HIS
RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT ON MY SHOULDER

EXCUSE ME LADIES AND GENTLEMAN SAID THE SERGEANT BUT AS I HAVE
MENTIONED AT THE DOOR TO THIS SMART YOUNG SHAVER WHICH HE HADNT
I AM ON A CHASE IN THE NAME OF THE KING AND I WANT THE BLACKSMITH

AND PRAY WHAT MIGHT YOU WANT WITH HIM RETORTED MY SISTER QUICK TO
RESENT HIS BEING WANTED AT ALL

MISSIS RETURNED THE GALLANT SERGEANT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I SHOULD
REPLY THE HONOUR AND PLEASURE OF HIS FINE WIFES ACQUAINTANCE
SPEAKING FOR THE KING I ANSWER A LITTLE JOB DONE

THIS WAS RECEIVED AS RATHER NEAT IN THE SERGEANT INSOMUCH THAT MR
PUMBLECHOOK CRIED AUDIBLY GOOD AGAIN

YOU SEE BLACKSMITH SAID THE SERGEANT WHO HAD BY THIS TIME PICKED
OUT JOE WITH HIS EYE WE HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH THESE AND I FIND
THE LOCK OF ONE OF EM GOES WRONG AND THE COUPLING DONT ACT PRETTY
AS THEY ARE WANTED FOR IMMEDIATE SERVICE WILL YOU THROW YOUR EYE OVER
THEM

JOE THREW HIS EYE OVER THEM AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE JOB WOULD
NECESSITATE THE LIGHTING OF HIS FORGE FIRE AND WOULD TAKE NEARER TWO
HOURS THAN ONE WILL IT THEN WILL YOU SET ABOUT IT AT ONCE
BLACKSMITH SAID THE OFFHAND SERGEANT AS ITS ON HIS MAJESTYS
SERVICE AND IF MY MEN CAN BEAR A HAND ANYWHERE THEYLL MAKE
THEMSELVES USEFUL WITH THAT HE CALLED TO HIS MEN WHO CAME TROOPING
INTO THE KITCHEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND PILED THEIR ARMS IN A CORNER
AND THEN THEY STOOD ABOUT AS SOLDIERS DO NOW WITH THEIR HANDS
LOOSELY CLASPED BEFORE THEM NOW RESTING A KNEE OR A SHOULDER NOW
EASING A BELT OR A POUCH NOW OPENING THE DOOR TO SPIT STIFFLY OVER
THEIR HIGH STOCKS OUT INTO THE YARD

ALL THESE THINGS I SAW WITHOUT THEN KNOWING THAT I SAW THEM FOR I WAS
IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION BUT BEGINNING TO PERCEIVE THAT THE
HANDCUFFS WERE NOT FOR ME AND THAT THE MILITARY HAD SO FAR GOT THE
BETTER OF THE PIE AS TO PUT IT IN THE BACKGROUND I COLLECTED A LITTLE
MORE OF MY SCATTERED WITS

WOULD YOU GIVE ME THE TIME SAID THE SERGEANT ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO
MR PUMBLECHOOK AS TO A MAN WHOSE APPRECIATIVE POWERS JUSTIFIED THE
INFERENCE THAT HE WAS EQUAL TO THE TIME

ITS JUST GONE HALF PAST TWO

THATS NOT SO BAD SAID THE SERGEANT REFLECTING EVEN IF I WAS
FORCED TO HALT HERE NIGH TWO HOURS THATLL DO HOW FAR MIGHT YOU CALL
YOURSELVES FROM THE MARSHES HEREABOUTS NOT ABOVE A MILE I RECKON

JUST A MILE SAID MRS JOE

THATLL DO WE BEGIN TO CLOSE IN UPON EM ABOUT DUSK A LITTLE BEFORE
DUSK MY ORDERS ARE THATLL DO

CONVICTS SERGEANT ASKED MR WOPSLE IN A MATTEROFCOURSE WAY

AY RETURNED THE SERGEANT TWO THEYRE PRETTY WELL KNOWN TO BE OUT
ON THE MARSHES STILL AND THEY WONT TRY TO GET CLEAR OF EM BEFORE
DUSK ANYBODY HERE SEEN ANYTHING OF ANY SUCH GAME

EVERYBODY MYSELF EXCEPTED SAID NO WITH CONFIDENCE NOBODY THOUGHT OF
ME

WELL SAID THE SERGEANT THEYLL FIND THEMSELVES TRAPPED IN A
CIRCLE I EXPECT SOONER THAN THEY COUNT ON NOW BLACKSMITH IF YOURE
READY HIS MAJESTY THE KING IS

JOE HAD GOT HIS COAT AND WAISTCOAT AND CRAVAT OFF AND HIS LEATHER
APRON ON AND PASSED INTO THE FORGE ONE OF THE SOLDIERS OPENED ITS
WOODEN WINDOWS ANOTHER LIGHTED THE FIRE ANOTHER TURNED TO AT THE
BELLOWS THE REST STOOD ROUND THE BLAZE WHICH WAS SOON ROARING THEN
JOE BEGAN TO HAMMER AND CLINK HAMMER AND CLINK AND WE ALL LOOKED ON

THE INTEREST OF THE IMPENDING PURSUIT NOT ONLY ABSORBED THE GENERAL
ATTENTION BUT EVEN MADE MY SISTER LIBERAL SHE DREW A PITCHER OF BEER
FROM THE CASK FOR THE SOLDIERS AND INVITED THE SERGEANT TO TAKE A
GLASS OF BRANDY BUT MR PUMBLECHOOK SAID SHARPLY GIVE HIM WINE
MUM ILL ENGAGE THERES NO TAR IN THAT SO THE SERGEANT THANKED HIM
AND SAID THAT AS HE PREFERRED HIS DRINK WITHOUT TAR HE WOULD TAKE
WINE IF IT WAS EQUALLY CONVENIENT WHEN IT WAS GIVEN HIM HE DRANK HIS
MAJESTYS HEALTH AND COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON AND TOOK IT ALL AT A
MOUTHFUL AND SMACKED HIS LIPS

GOOD STUFF EH SERGEANT SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK

ILL TELL YOU SOMETHING RETURNED THE SERGEANT I SUSPECT THAT
STUFFS OF YOUR PROVIDING

MR PUMBLECHOOK WITH A FAT SORT OF LAUGH SAID AY AY WHY

BECAUSE RETURNED THE SERGEANT CLAPPING HIM ON THE SHOULDER YOURE
A MAN THAT KNOWS WHATS WHAT

DYE THINK SO SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK WITH HIS FORMER LAUGH HAVE
ANOTHER GLASS

WITH YOU HOB AND NOB RETURNED THE SERGEANT THE TOP OF MINE TO THE
FOOT OF YOURSTHE FOOT OF YOURS TO THE TOP OF MINERING ONCE RING
TWICETHE BEST TUNE ON THE MUSICAL GLASSES YOUR HEALTH MAY YOU LIVE
A THOUSAND YEARS AND NEVER BE A WORSE JUDGE OF THE RIGHT SORT THAN YOU
ARE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE

THE SERGEANT TOSSED OFF HIS GLASS AGAIN AND SEEMED QUITE READY FOR
ANOTHER GLASS I NOTICED THAT MR PUMBLECHOOK IN HIS HOSPITALITY
APPEARED TO FORGET THAT HE HAD MADE A PRESENT OF THE WINE BUT TOOK THE
BOTTLE FROM MRS JOE AND HAD ALL THE CREDIT OF HANDING IT ABOUT IN A
GUSH OF JOVIALITY EVEN I GOT SOME AND HE WAS SO VERY FREE OF THE WINE
THAT HE EVEN CALLED FOR THE OTHER BOTTLE AND HANDED THAT ABOUT WITH
THE SAME LIBERALITY WHEN THE FIRST WAS GONE

AS I WATCHED THEM WHILE THEY ALL STOOD CLUSTERING ABOUT THE FORGE
ENJOYING THEMSELVES SO MUCH I THOUGHT WHAT TERRIBLE GOOD SAUCE FOR A
DINNER MY FUGITIVE FRIEND ON THE MARSHES WAS THEY HAD NOT ENJOYED
THEMSELVES A QUARTER SO MUCH BEFORE THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS BRIGHTENED
WITH THE EXCITEMENT HE FURNISHED AND NOW WHEN THEY WERE ALL IN LIVELY
ANTICIPATION OF THE TWO VILLAINS BEING TAKEN AND WHEN THE BELLOWS
SEEMED TO ROAR FOR THE FUGITIVES THE FIRE TO FLARE FOR THEM THE SMOKE
TO HURRY AWAY IN PURSUIT OF THEM JOE TO HAMMER AND CLINK FOR THEM AND
ALL THE MURKY SHADOWS ON THE WALL TO SHAKE AT THEM IN MENACE AS THE
BLAZE ROSE AND SANK AND THE REDHOT SPARKS DROPPED AND DIED THE PALE
AFTERNOON OUTSIDE ALMOST SEEMED IN MY PITYING YOUNG FANCY TO HAVE
TURNED PALE ON THEIR ACCOUNT POOR WRETCHES

AT LAST JOES JOB WAS DONE AND THE RINGING AND ROARING STOPPED AS
JOE GOT ON HIS COAT HE MUSTERED COURAGE TO PROPOSE THAT SOME OF US
SHOULD GO DOWN WITH THE SOLDIERS AND SEE WHAT CAME OF THE HUNT MR
PUMBLECHOOK AND MR HUBBLE DECLINED ON THE PLEA OF A PIPE AND LADIES
SOCIETY BUT MR WOPSLE SAID HE WOULD GO IF JOE WOULD JOE SAID HE WAS
AGREEABLE AND WOULD TAKE ME IF MRS JOE APPROVED WE NEVER SHOULD
HAVE GOT LEAVE TO GO I AM SURE BUT FOR MRS JOES CURIOSITY TO KNOW
ALL ABOUT IT AND HOW IT ENDED AS IT WAS SHE MERELY STIPULATED IF
YOU BRING THE BOY BACK WITH HIS HEAD BLOWN TO BITS BY A MUSKET DONT
LOOK TO ME TO PUT IT TOGETHER AGAIN

THE SERGEANT TOOK A POLITE LEAVE OF THE LADIES AND PARTED FROM MR
PUMBLECHOOK AS FROM A COMRADE THOUGH I DOUBT IF HE WERE QUITE AS FULLY
SENSIBLE OF THAT GENTLEMANS MERITS UNDER ARID CONDITIONS AS WHEN
SOMETHING MOIST WAS GOING HIS MEN RESUMED THEIR MUSKETS AND FELL IN
MR WOPSLE JOE AND I RECEIVED STRICT CHARGE TO KEEP IN THE REAR AND
TO SPEAK NO WORD AFTER WE REACHED THE MARSHES WHEN WE WERE ALL OUT IN
THE RAW AIR AND WERE STEADILY MOVING TOWARDS OUR BUSINESS I
TREASONABLY WHISPERED TO JOE I HOPE JOE WE SHANT FIND THEM AND
JOE WHISPERED TO ME ID GIVE A SHILLING IF THEY HAD CUT AND RUN
PIP

WE WERE JOINED BY NO STRAGGLERS FROM THE VILLAGE FOR THE WEATHER WAS
COLD AND THREATENING THE WAY DREARY THE FOOTING BAD DARKNESS COMING
ON AND THE PEOPLE HAD GOOD FIRES INDOORS AND WERE KEEPING THE DAY A
FEW FACES HURRIED TO GLOWING WINDOWS AND LOOKED AFTER US BUT NONE CAME
OUT WE PASSED THE FINGERPOST AND HELD STRAIGHT ON TO THE CHURCHYARD
THERE WE WERE STOPPED A FEW MINUTES BY A SIGNAL FROM THE SERGEANTS
HAND WHILE TWO OR THREE OF HIS MEN DISPERSED THEMSELVES AMONG THE
GRAVES AND ALSO EXAMINED THE PORCH THEY CAME IN AGAIN WITHOUT FINDING
ANYTHING AND THEN WE STRUCK OUT ON THE OPEN MARSHES THROUGH THE GATE
AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCHYARD A BITTER SLEET CAME RATTLING AGAINST US
HERE ON THE EAST WIND AND JOE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK

NOW THAT WE WERE OUT UPON THE DISMAL WILDERNESS WHERE THEY LITTLE
THOUGHT I HAD BEEN WITHIN EIGHT OR NINE HOURS AND HAD SEEN BOTH MEN
HIDING I CONSIDERED FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH GREAT DREAD IF WE SHOULD
COME UPON THEM WOULD MY PARTICULAR CONVICT SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS I WHO
HAD BROUGHT THE SOLDIERS THERE HE HAD ASKED ME IF I WAS A DECEIVING
IMP AND HE HAD SAID I SHOULD BE A FIERCE YOUNG HOUND IF I JOINED THE
HUNT AGAINST HIM WOULD HE BELIEVE THAT I WAS BOTH IMP AND HOUND IN
TREACHEROUS EARNEST AND HAD BETRAYED HIM

IT WAS OF NO USE ASKING MYSELF THIS QUESTION NOW THERE I WAS ON JOES
BACK AND THERE WAS JOE BENEATH ME CHARGING AT THE DITCHES LIKE A
HUNTER AND STIMULATING MR WOPSLE NOT TO TUMBLE ON HIS ROMAN NOSE AND
TO KEEP UP WITH US THE SOLDIERS WERE IN FRONT OF US EXTENDING INTO A
PRETTY WIDE LINE WITH AN INTERVAL BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WE WERE TAKING
THE COURSE I HAD BEGUN WITH AND FROM WHICH I HAD DIVERGED IN THE MIST
EITHER THE MIST WAS NOT OUT AGAIN YET OR THE WIND HAD DISPELLED IT
UNDER THE LOW RED GLARE OF SUNSET THE BEACON AND THE GIBBET AND THE
MOUND OF THE BATTERY AND THE OPPOSITE SHORE OF THE RIVER WERE PLAIN
THOUGH ALL OF A WATERY LEAD COLOUR

WITH MY HEART THUMPING LIKE A BLACKSMITH AT JOES BROAD SHOULDER I
LOOKED ALL ABOUT FOR ANY SIGN OF THE CONVICTS I COULD SEE NONE I
COULD HEAR NONE MR WOPSLE HAD GREATLY ALARMED ME MORE THAN ONCE BY
HIS BLOWING AND HARD BREATHING BUT I KNEW THE SOUNDS BY THIS TIME AND
COULD DISSOCIATE THEM FROM THE OBJECT OF PURSUIT I GOT A DREADFUL
START WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD THE FILE STILL GOING BUT IT WAS ONLY A
SHEEPBELL THE SHEEP STOPPED IN THEIR EATING AND LOOKED TIMIDLY AT US
AND THE CATTLE THEIR HEADS TURNED FROM THE WIND AND SLEET STARED
ANGRILY AS IF THEY HELD US RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH ANNOYANCES BUT EXCEPT
THESE THINGS AND THE SHUDDER OF THE DYING DAY IN EVERY BLADE OF GRASS
THERE WAS NO BREAK IN THE BLEAK STILLNESS OF THE MARSHES

THE SOLDIERS WERE MOVING ON IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OLD BATTERY AND WE
WERE MOVING ON A LITTLE WAY BEHIND THEM WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ALL
STOPPED FOR THERE HAD REACHED US ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND AND RAIN A
LONG SHOUT IT WAS REPEATED IT WAS AT A DISTANCE TOWARDS THE EAST BUT
IT WAS LONG AND LOUD NAY THERE SEEMED TO BE TWO OR MORE SHOUTS RAISED
TOGETHERIF ONE MIGHT JUDGE FROM A CONFUSION IN THE SOUND

TO THIS EFFECT THE SERGEANT AND THE NEAREST MEN WERE SPEAKING UNDER
THEIR BREATH WHEN JOE AND I CAME UP AFTER ANOTHER MOMENTS LISTENING
JOE WHO WAS A GOOD JUDGE AGREED AND MR WOPSLE WHO WAS A BAD JUDGE
AGREED THE SERGEANT A DECISIVE MAN ORDERED THAT THE SOUND SHOULD NOT
BE ANSWERED BUT THAT THE COURSE SHOULD BE CHANGED AND THAT HIS MEN
SHOULD MAKE TOWARDS IT AT THE DOUBLE SO WE SLANTED TO THE RIGHT
WHERE THE EAST WAS AND JOE POUNDED AWAY SO WONDERFULLY THAT I HAD
TO HOLD ON TIGHT TO KEEP MY SEAT

IT WAS A RUN INDEED NOW AND WHAT JOE CALLED IN THE ONLY TWO WORDS HE
SPOKE ALL THE TIME A WINDER DOWN BANKS AND UP BANKS AND OVER
GATES AND SPLASHING INTO DIKES AND BREAKING AMONG COARSE RUSHES NO
MAN CARED WHERE HE WENT AS WE CAME NEARER TO THE SHOUTING IT BECAME
MORE AND MORE APPARENT THAT IT WAS MADE BY MORE THAN ONE VOICE
SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO STOP ALTOGETHER AND THEN THE SOLDIERS STOPPED
WHEN IT BROKE OUT AGAIN THE SOLDIERS MADE FOR IT AT A GREATER RATE
THAN EVER AND WE AFTER THEM AFTER A WHILE WE HAD SO RUN IT DOWN
THAT WE COULD HEAR ONE VOICE CALLING MURDER AND ANOTHER VOICE
CONVICTS RUNAWAYS GUARD THIS WAY FOR THE RUNAWAY CONVICTS THEN
BOTH VOICES WOULD SEEM TO BE STIFLED IN A STRUGGLE AND THEN WOULD
BREAK OUT AGAIN AND WHEN IT HAD COME TO THIS THE SOLDIERS RAN LIKE
DEER AND JOE TOO

THE SERGEANT RAN IN FIRST WHEN WE HAD RUN THE NOISE QUITE DOWN AND
TWO OF HIS MEN RAN IN CLOSE UPON HIM THEIR PIECES WERE COCKED AND
LEVELLED WHEN WE ALL RAN IN

HERE ARE BOTH MEN PANTED THE SERGEANT STRUGGLING AT THE BOTTOM OF A
DITCH SURRENDER YOU TWO AND CONFOUND YOU FOR TWO WILD BEASTS COME
ASUNDER

WATER WAS SPLASHING AND MUD WAS FLYING AND OATHS WERE BEING SWORN
AND BLOWS WERE BEING STRUCK WHEN SOME MORE MEN WENT DOWN INTO THE
DITCH TO HELP THE SERGEANT AND DRAGGED OUT SEPARATELY MY CONVICT AND
THE OTHER ONE BOTH WERE BLEEDING AND PANTING AND EXECRATING AND
STRUGGLING BUT OF COURSE I KNEW THEM BOTH DIRECTLY

MIND SAID MY CONVICT WIPING BLOOD FROM HIS FACE WITH HIS RAGGED
SLEEVES AND SHAKING TORN HAIR FROM HIS FINGERS I TOOK HIM I
GIVE HIM UP TO YOU MIND THAT

ITS NOT MUCH TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT SAID THE SERGEANT ITLL DO
YOU SMALL GOOD MY MAN BEING IN THE SAME PLIGHT YOURSELF HANDCUFFS
THERE

I DONT EXPECT IT TO DO ME ANY GOOD I DONT WANT IT TO DO ME MORE
GOOD THAN IT DOES NOW SAID MY CONVICT WITH A GREEDY LAUGH I TOOK
HIM HE KNOWS IT THATS ENOUGH FOR ME

THE OTHER CONVICT WAS LIVID TO LOOK AT AND IN ADDITION TO THE OLD
BRUISED LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE SEEMED TO BE BRUISED AND TORN ALL OVER
HE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS GET HIS BREATH TO SPEAK UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH
SEPARATELY HANDCUFFED BUT LEANED UPON A SOLDIER TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM
FALLING

TAKE NOTICE GUARDHE TRIED TO MURDER ME WERE HIS FIRST WORDS

TRIED TO MURDER HIM SAID MY CONVICT DISDAINFULLY TRY AND NOT DO
IT I TOOK HIM AND GIV HIM UP THATS WHAT I DONE I NOT ONLY
PREVENTED HIM GETTING OFF THE MARSHES BUT I DRAGGED HIM HEREDRAGGED
HIM THIS FAR ON HIS WAY BACK HES A GENTLEMAN IF YOU PLEASE THIS
VILLAIN NOW THE HULKS HAS GOT ITS GENTLEMAN AGAIN THROUGH ME MURDER
HIM WORTH MY WHILE TOO TO MURDER HIM WHEN I COULD DO WORSE AND DRAG
HIM BACK

THE OTHER ONE STILL GASPED HE TRIEDHE TRIEDTOMURDER ME BEARBEAR
WITNESS

LOOKEE HERE SAID MY CONVICT TO THE SERGEANT SINGLEHANDED I GOT
CLEAR OF THE PRISONSHIP I MADE A DASH AND I DONE IT I COULD HA GOT
CLEAR OF THESE DEATHCOLD FLATS LIKEWISELOOK AT MY LEG YOU WONT FIND
MUCH IRON ON ITIF I HADNT MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT HE WAS HERE LET
HIM GO FREE LET HIM PROFIT BY THE MEANS AS I FOUND OUT LET HIM
MAKE A TOOL OF ME AFRESH AND AGAIN ONCE MORE NO NO NO IF I HAD
DIED AT THE BOTTOM THERE AND HE MADE AN EMPHATIC SWING AT THE DITCH
WITH HIS MANACLED HANDS ID HAVE HELD TO HIM WITH THAT GRIP THAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE TO FIND HIM IN MY HOLD

THE OTHER FUGITIVE WHO WAS EVIDENTLY IN EXTREME HORROR OF HIS
COMPANION REPEATED HE TRIED TO MURDER ME I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DEAD
MAN IF YOU HAD NOT COME UP

HE LIES SAID MY CONVICT WITH FIERCE ENERGY HES A LIAR BORN AND
HELL DIE A LIAR LOOK AT HIS FACE AINT IT WRITTEN THERE LET HIM
TURN THOSE EYES OF HIS ON ME I DEFY HIM TO DO IT

THE OTHER WITH AN EFFORT AT A SCORNFUL SMILE WHICH COULD NOT
HOWEVER COLLECT THE NERVOUS WORKING OF HIS MOUTH INTO ANY SET
EXPRESSION LOOKED AT THE SOLDIERS AND LOOKED ABOUT AT THE MARSHES AND
AT THE SKY BUT CERTAINLY DID NOT LOOK AT THE SPEAKER

DO YOU SEE HIM PURSUED MY CONVICT DO YOU SEE WHAT A VILLAIN HE IS
DO YOU SEE THOSE GROVELLING AND WANDERING EYES THATS HOW HE LOOKED
WHEN WE WERE TRIED TOGETHER HE NEVER LOOKED AT ME

THE OTHER ALWAYS WORKING AND WORKING HIS DRY LIPS AND TURNING HIS EYES
RESTLESSLY ABOUT HIM FAR AND NEAR DID AT LAST TURN THEM FOR A MOMENT
ON THE SPEAKER WITH THE WORDS YOU ARE NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT AND WITH
A HALFTAUNTING GLANCE AT THE BOUND HANDS AT THAT POINT MY CONVICT
BECAME SO FRANTICALLY EXASPERATED THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUSHED UPON HIM
BUT FOR THE INTERPOSITION OF THE SOLDIERS DIDNT I TELL YOU SAID
THE OTHER CONVICT THEN THAT HE WOULD MURDER ME IF HE COULD AND ANY
ONE COULD SEE THAT HE SHOOK WITH FEAR AND THAT THERE BROKE OUT UPON
HIS LIPS CURIOUS WHITE FLAKES LIKE THIN SNOW

ENOUGH OF THIS PARLEY SAID THE SERGEANT LIGHT THOSE TORCHES

AS ONE OF THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED A BASKET IN LIEU OF A GUN WENT
DOWN ON HIS KNEE TO OPEN IT MY CONVICT LOOKED ROUND HIM FOR THE FIRST
TIME AND SAW ME I HAD ALIGHTED FROM JOES BACK ON THE BRINK OF THE
DITCH WHEN WE CAME UP AND HAD NOT MOVED SINCE I LOOKED AT HIM EAGERLY
WHEN HE LOOKED AT ME AND SLIGHTLY MOVED MY HANDS AND SHOOK MY HEAD I
HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO SEE ME THAT I MIGHT TRY TO ASSURE HIM OF MY
INNOCENCE IT WAS NOT AT ALL EXPRESSED TO ME THAT HE EVEN COMPREHENDED
MY INTENTION FOR HE GAVE ME A LOOK THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND IT
ALL PASSED IN A MOMENT BUT IF HE HAD LOOKED AT ME FOR AN HOUR OR FOR A
DAY I COULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED HIS FACE EVER AFTERWARDS AS HAVING
BEEN MORE ATTENTIVE

THE SOLDIER WITH THE BASKET SOON GOT A LIGHT AND LIGHTED THREE OR FOUR
TORCHES AND TOOK ONE HIMSELF AND DISTRIBUTED THE OTHERS IT HAD BEEN
ALMOST DARK BEFORE BUT NOW IT SEEMED QUITE DARK AND SOON AFTERWARDS
VERY DARK BEFORE WE DEPARTED FROM THAT SPOT FOUR SOLDIERS STANDING IN
A RING FIRED TWICE INTO THE AIR PRESENTLY WE SAW OTHER TORCHES
KINDLED AT SOME DISTANCE BEHIND US AND OTHERS ON THE MARSHES ON THE
OPPOSITE BANK OF THE RIVER ALL RIGHT SAID THE SERGEANT MARCH

WE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN THREE CANNON WERE FIRED AHEAD OF US WITH A
SOUND THAT SEEMED TO BURST SOMETHING INSIDE MY EAR YOU ARE EXPECTED
ON BOARD SAID THE SERGEANT TO MY CONVICT THEY KNOW YOU ARE COMING
DONT STRAGGLE MY MAN CLOSE UP HERE

THE TWO WERE KEPT APART AND EACH WALKED SURROUNDED BY A SEPARATE
GUARD I HAD HOLD OF JOES HAND NOW AND JOE CARRIED ONE OF THE
TORCHES MR WOPSLE HAD BEEN FOR GOING BACK BUT JOE WAS RESOLVED TO
SEE IT OUT SO WE WENT ON WITH THE PARTY THERE WAS A REASONABLY GOOD
PATH NOW MOSTLY ON THE EDGE OF THE RIVER WITH A DIVERGENCE HERE AND
THERE WHERE A DIKE CAME WITH A MINIATURE WINDMILL ON IT AND A MUDDY
SLUICEGATE WHEN I LOOKED ROUND I COULD SEE THE OTHER LIGHTS COMING
IN AFTER US THE TORCHES WE CARRIED DROPPED GREAT BLOTCHES OF FIRE UPON
THE TRACK AND I COULD SEE THOSE TOO LYING SMOKING AND FLARING I
COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE BUT BLACK DARKNESS OUR LIGHTS WARMED THE AIR
ABOUT US WITH THEIR PITCHY BLAZE AND THE TWO PRISONERS SEEMED RATHER
TO LIKE THAT AS THEY LIMPED ALONG IN THE MIDST OF THE MUSKETS WE
COULD NOT GO FAST BECAUSE OF THEIR LAMENESS AND THEY WERE SO SPENT
THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES WE HAD TO HALT WHILE THEY RESTED

AFTER AN HOUR OR SO OF THIS TRAVELLING WE CAME TO A ROUGH WOODEN HUT
AND A LANDINGPLACE THERE WAS A GUARD IN THE HUT AND THEY CHALLENGED
AND THE SERGEANT ANSWERED THEN WE WENT INTO THE HUT WHERE THERE WAS
A SMELL OF TOBACCO AND WHITEWASH AND A BRIGHT FIRE AND A LAMP AND A
STAND OF MUSKETS AND A DRUM AND A LOW WOODEN BEDSTEAD LIKE AN
OVERGROWN MANGLE WITHOUT THE MACHINERY CAPABLE OF HOLDING ABOUT A
DOZEN SOLDIERS ALL AT ONCE THREE OR FOUR SOLDIERS WHO LAY UPON IT IN
THEIR GREATCOATS WERE NOT MUCH INTERESTED IN US BUT JUST LIFTED THEIR
HEADS AND TOOK A SLEEPY STARE AND THEN LAY DOWN AGAIN THE SERGEANT
MADE SOME KIND OF REPORT AND SOME ENTRY IN A BOOK AND THEN THE
CONVICT WHOM I CALL THE OTHER CONVICT WAS DRAFTED OFF WITH HIS GUARD
TO GO ON BOARD FIRST

MY CONVICT NEVER LOOKED AT ME EXCEPT THAT ONCE WHILE WE STOOD IN THE
HUT HE STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT IT OR PUTTING UP
HIS FEET BY TURNS UPON THE HOB AND LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THEM AS IF
HE PITIED THEM FOR THEIR RECENT ADVENTURES SUDDENLY HE TURNED TO THE
SERGEANT AND REMARKED

I WISH TO SAY SOMETHING RESPECTING THIS ESCAPE IT MAY PREVENT SOME
PERSONS LAYING UNDER SUSPICION ALONGER ME

YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU LIKE RETURNED THE SERGEANT STANDING COOLLY
LOOKING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED BUT YOU HAVE NO CALL TO SAY IT
HERE YOULL HAVE OPPORTUNITY ENOUGH TO SAY ABOUT IT AND HEAR ABOUT
IT BEFORE ITS DONE WITH YOU KNOW

I KNOW BUT THIS IS ANOTHER PINT A SEPARATE MATTER A MAN CANT
STARVE AT LEAST I CANT I TOOK SOME WITTLES UP AT THE WILLAGE OVER
YONDERWHERE THE CHURCH STANDS AMOST OUT ON THE MARSHES

YOU MEAN STOLE SAID THE SERGEANT

AND ILL TELL YOU WHERE FROM FROM THE BLACKSMITHS

HALLOA SAID THE SERGEANT STARING AT JOE

HALLOA PIP SAID JOE STARING AT ME

IT WAS SOME BROKEN WITTLESTHATS WHAT IT WASAND A DRAM OF LIQUOR
AND A PIE

HAVE YOU HAPPENED TO MISS SUCH AN ARTICLE AS A PIE BLACKSMITH ASKED
THE SERGEANT CONFIDENTIALLY

MY WIFE DID AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN YOU CAME IN DONT YOU KNOW
PIP

SO SAID MY CONVICT TURNING HIS EYES ON JOE IN A MOODY MANNER AND
WITHOUT THE LEAST GLANCE AT MESO YOURE THE BLACKSMITH ARE YOU
THAN IM SORRY TO SAY IVE EAT YOUR PIE

GOD KNOWS YOURE WELCOME TO ITSO FAR AS IT WAS EVER MINE RETURNED
JOE WITH A SAVING REMEMBRANCE OF MRS JOE WE DONT KNOW WHAT YOU
HAVE DONE BUT WE WOULDNT HAVE YOU STARVED TO DEATH FOR IT POOR
MISERABLE FELLOWCREATURWOULD US PIP

THE SOMETHING THAT I HAD NOTICED BEFORE CLICKED IN THE MANS THROAT
AGAIN AND HE TURNED HIS BACK THE BOAT HAD RETURNED AND HIS GUARD
WERE READY SO WE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE LANDINGPLACE MADE OF ROUGH
STAKES AND STONES AND SAW HIM PUT INTO THE BOAT WHICH WAS ROWED BY A
CREW OF CONVICTS LIKE HIMSELF NO ONE SEEMED SURPRISED TO SEE HIM OR
INTERESTED IN SEEING HIM OR GLAD TO SEE HIM OR SORRY TO SEE HIM OR
SPOKE A WORD EXCEPT THAT SOMEBODY IN THE BOAT GROWLED AS IF TO DOGS
GIVE WAY YOU WHICH WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE DIP OF THE OARS BY THE
LIGHT OF THE TORCHES WE SAW THE BLACK HULK LYING OUT A LITTLE WAY FROM
THE MUD OF THE SHORE LIKE A WICKED NOAHS ARK CRIBBED AND BARRED AND
MOORED BY MASSIVE RUSTY CHAINS THE PRISONSHIP SEEMED IN MY YOUNG EYES
TO BE IRONED LIKE THE PRISONERS WE SAW THE BOAT GO ALONGSIDE AND WE
SAW HIM TAKEN UP THE SIDE AND DISAPPEAR THEN THE ENDS OF THE TORCHES
WERE FLUNG HISSING INTO THE WATER AND WENT OUT AS IF IT WERE ALL OVER
WITH HIM




CHAPTER VI


MY STATE OF MIND REGARDING THE PILFERING FROM WHICH I HAD BEEN SO
UNEXPECTEDLY EXONERATED DID NOT IMPEL ME TO FRANK DISCLOSURE BUT I
HOPE IT HAD SOME DREGS OF GOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF IT

I DO NOT RECALL THAT I FELT ANY TENDERNESS OF CONSCIENCE IN REFERENCE
TO MRS JOE WHEN THE FEAR OF BEING FOUND OUT WAS LIFTED OFF ME BUT I
LOVED JOEPERHAPS FOR NO BETTER REASON IN THOSE EARLY DAYS THAN
BECAUSE THE DEAR FELLOW LET ME LOVE HIMAND AS TO HIM MY INNER SELF
WAS NOT SO EASILY COMPOSED IT WAS MUCH UPON MY MIND PARTICULARLY WHEN
I FIRST SAW HIM LOOKING ABOUT FOR HIS FILE THAT I OUGHT TO TELL JOE
THE WHOLE TRUTH YET I DID NOT AND FOR THE REASON THAT I MISTRUSTED
THAT IF I DID HE WOULD THINK ME WORSE THAN I WAS THE FEAR OF LOSING
JOES CONFIDENCE AND OF THENCEFORTH SITTING IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER AT
NIGHT STARING DREARILY AT MY FOREVER LOST COMPANION AND FRIEND TIED UP
MY TONGUE I MORBIDLY REPRESENTED TO MYSELF THAT IF JOE KNEW IT I
NEVER AFTERWARDS COULD SEE HIM AT THE FIRESIDE FEELING HIS FAIR
WHISKER WITHOUT THINKING THAT HE WAS MEDITATING ON IT THAT IF JOE
KNEW IT I NEVER AFTERWARDS COULD SEE HIM GLANCE HOWEVER CASUALLY AT
YESTERDAYS MEAT OR PUDDING WHEN IT CAME ON TODAYS TABLE WITHOUT
THINKING THAT HE WAS DEBATING WHETHER I HAD BEEN IN THE PANTRY THAT
IF JOE KNEW IT AND AT ANY SUBSEQUENT PERIOD OF OUR JOINT DOMESTIC LIFE
REMARKED THAT HIS BEER WAS FLAT OR THICK THE CONVICTION THAT HE
SUSPECTED TAR IN IT WOULD BRING A RUSH OF BLOOD TO MY FACE IN A WORD
I WAS TOO COWARDLY TO DO WHAT I KNEW TO BE RIGHT AS I HAD BEEN TOO
COWARDLY TO AVOID DOING WHAT I KNEW TO BE WRONG I HAD HAD NO
INTERCOURSE WITH THE WORLD AT THAT TIME AND I IMITATED NONE OF ITS
MANY INHABITANTS WHO ACT IN THIS MANNER QUITE AN UNTAUGHT GENIUS I
MADE THE DISCOVERY OF THE LINE OF ACTION FOR MYSELF

AS I WAS SLEEPY BEFORE WE WERE FAR AWAY FROM THE PRISONSHIP JOE TOOK
ME ON HIS BACK AGAIN AND CARRIED ME HOME HE MUST HAVE HAD A TIRESOME
JOURNEY OF IT FOR MR WOPSLE BEING KNOCKED UP WAS IN SUCH A VERY BAD
TEMPER THAT IF THE CHURCH HAD BEEN THROWN OPEN HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
EXCOMMUNICATED THE WHOLE EXPEDITION BEGINNING WITH JOE AND MYSELF IN
HIS LAY CAPACITY HE PERSISTED IN SITTING DOWN IN THE DAMP TO SUCH AN
INSANE EXTENT THAT WHEN HIS COAT WAS TAKEN OFF TO BE DRIED AT THE
KITCHEN FIRE THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ON HIS TROUSERS WOULD HAVE
HANGED HIM IF IT HAD BEEN A CAPITAL OFFENCE

BY THAT TIME I WAS STAGGERING ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE A LITTLE
DRUNKARD THROUGH HAVING BEEN NEWLY SET UPON MY FEET AND THROUGH
HAVING BEEN FAST ASLEEP AND THROUGH WAKING IN THE HEAT AND LIGHTS AND
NOISE OF TONGUES AS I CAME TO MYSELF WITH THE AID OF A HEAVY THUMP
BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS AND THE RESTORATIVE EXCLAMATION YAH WAS THERE
EVER SUCH A BOY AS THIS FROM MY SISTER I FOUND JOE TELLING THEM
ABOUT THE CONVICTS CONFESSION AND ALL THE VISITORS SUGGESTING
DIFFERENT WAYS BY WHICH HE HAD GOT INTO THE PANTRY MR PUMBLECHOOK
MADE OUT AFTER CAREFULLY SURVEYING THE PREMISES THAT HE HAD FIRST GOT
UPON THE ROOF OF THE FORGE AND HAD THEN GOT UPON THE ROOF OF THE
HOUSE AND HAD THEN LET HIMSELF DOWN THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY BY A ROPE MADE
OF HIS BEDDING CUT INTO STRIPS AND AS MR PUMBLECHOOK WAS VERY
POSITIVE AND DROVE HIS OWN CHAISECARTOVER EVERYBODYIT WAS AGREED
THAT IT MUST BE SO MR WOPSLE INDEED WILDLY CRIED OUT NO WITH
THE FEEBLE MALICE OF A TIRED MAN BUT AS HE HAD NO THEORY AND NO COAT
ON HE WAS UNANIMOUSLY SET AT NAUGHTNOT TO MENTION HIS SMOKING HARD
BEHIND AS HE STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE KITCHEN FIRE TO DRAW THE DAMP
OUT WHICH WAS NOT CALCULATED TO INSPIRE CONFIDENCE

THIS WAS ALL I HEARD THAT NIGHT BEFORE MY SISTER CLUTCHED ME AS A
SLUMBEROUS OFFENCE TO THE COMPANYS EYESIGHT AND ASSISTED ME UP TO BED
WITH SUCH A STRONG HAND THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE FIFTY BOOTS ON AND TO BE
DANGLING THEM ALL AGAINST THE EDGES OF THE STAIRS MY STATE OF MIND AS
I HAVE DESCRIBED IT BEGAN BEFORE I WAS UP IN THE MORNING AND LASTED
LONG AFTER THE SUBJECT HAD DIED OUT AND HAD CEASED TO BE MENTIONED
SAVING ON EXCEPTIONAL OCCASIONS




CHAPTER VII


AT THE TIME WHEN I STOOD IN THE CHURCHYARD READING THE FAMILY
TOMBSTONES I HAD JUST ENOUGH LEARNING TO BE ABLE TO SPELL THEM OUT MY
CONSTRUCTION EVEN OF THEIR SIMPLE MEANING WAS NOT VERY CORRECT FOR I
READ WIFE OF THE ABOVE AS A COMPLIMENTARY REFERENCE TO MY FATHERS
EXALTATION TO A BETTER WORLD AND IF ANY ONE OF MY DECEASED RELATIONS
HAD BEEN REFERRED TO AS BELOW I HAVE NO DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE FORMED
THE WORST OPINIONS OF THAT MEMBER OF THE FAMILY NEITHER WERE MY
NOTIONS OF THE THEOLOGICAL POSITIONS TO WHICH MY CATECHISM BOUND ME AT
ALL ACCURATE FOR I HAVE A LIVELY REMEMBRANCE THAT I SUPPOSED MY
DECLARATION THAT I WAS TO WALK IN THE SAME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE
LAID ME UNDER AN OBLIGATION ALWAYS TO GO THROUGH THE VILLAGE FROM OUR
HOUSE IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND NEVER TO VARY IT BY TURNING DOWN
BY THE WHEELWRIGHTS OR UP BY THE MILL

WHEN I WAS OLD ENOUGH I WAS TO BE APPRENTICED TO JOE AND UNTIL I
COULD ASSUME THAT DIGNITY I WAS NOT TO BE WHAT MRS JOE CALLED
POMPEYED OR AS I RENDER IT PAMPERED THEREFORE I WAS NOT ONLY
ODDBOY ABOUT THE FORGE BUT IF ANY NEIGHBOUR HAPPENED TO WANT AN EXTRA
BOY TO FRIGHTEN BIRDS OR PICK UP STONES OR DO ANY SUCH JOB I WAS
FAVOURED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER HOWEVER THAT OUR SUPERIOR
POSITION MIGHT NOT BE COMPROMISED THEREBY A MONEYBOX WAS KEPT ON THE
KITCHEN MANTELSHELF INTO WHICH IT WAS PUBLICLY MADE KNOWN THAT ALL MY
EARNINGS WERE DROPPED I HAVE AN IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE TO BE
CONTRIBUTED EVENTUALLY TOWARDS THE LIQUIDATION OF THE NATIONAL DEBT
BUT I KNOW I HAD NO HOPE OF ANY PERSONAL PARTICIPATION IN THE TREASURE

MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT KEPT AN EVENING SCHOOL IN THE VILLAGE THAT IS
TO SAY SHE WAS A RIDICULOUS OLD WOMAN OF LIMITED MEANS AND UNLIMITED
INFIRMITY WHO USED TO GO TO SLEEP FROM SIX TO SEVEN EVERY EVENING IN
THE SOCIETY OF YOUTH WHO PAID TWO PENCE PER WEEK EACH FOR THE
IMPROVING OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HER DO IT SHE RENTED A SMALL COTTAGE
AND MR WOPSLE HAD THE ROOM UPSTAIRS WHERE WE STUDENTS USED TO
OVERHEAR HIM READING ALOUD IN A MOST DIGNIFIED AND TERRIFIC MANNER AND
OCCASIONALLY BUMPING ON THE CEILING THERE WAS A FICTION THAT MR
WOPSLE EXAMINED THE SCHOLARS ONCE A QUARTER WHAT HE DID ON THOSE
OCCASIONS WAS TO TURN UP HIS CUFFS STICK UP HIS HAIR AND GIVE US MARK
ANTONYS ORATION OVER THE BODY OF CAESAR THIS WAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY
COLLINSS ODE ON THE PASSIONS WHEREIN I PARTICULARLY VENERATED MR
WOPSLE AS REVENGE THROWING HIS BLOODSTAINED SWORD IN THUNDER DOWN AND
TAKING THE WARDENOUNCING TRUMPET WITH A WITHERING LOOK IT WAS NOT
WITH ME THEN AS IT WAS IN LATER LIFE WHEN I FELL INTO THE SOCIETY OF
THE PASSIONS AND COMPARED THEM WITH COLLINS AND WOPSLE RATHER TO THE
DISADVANTAGE OF BOTH GENTLEMEN

MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT BESIDES KEEPING THIS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
KEPT IN THE SAME ROOMA LITTLE GENERAL SHOP SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT STOCK
SHE HAD OR WHAT THE PRICE OF ANYTHING IN IT WAS BUT THERE WAS A
LITTLE GREASY MEMORANDUMBOOK KEPT IN A DRAWER WHICH SERVED AS A
CATALOGUE OF PRICES AND BY THIS ORACLE BIDDY ARRANGED ALL THE SHOP
TRANSACTIONS BIDDY WAS MR WOPSLES GREATAUNTS GRANDDAUGHTER I
CONFESS MYSELF QUITE UNEQUAL TO THE WORKING OUT OF THE PROBLEM WHAT
RELATION SHE WAS TO MR WOPSLE SHE WAS AN ORPHAN LIKE MYSELF LIKE ME
TOO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY HAND SHE WAS MOST NOTICEABLE I THOUGHT
IN RESPECT OF HER EXTREMITIES FOR HER HAIR ALWAYS WANTED BRUSHING
HER HANDS ALWAYS WANTED WASHING AND HER SHOES ALWAYS WANTED MENDING
AND PULLING UP AT HEEL THIS DESCRIPTION MUST BE RECEIVED WITH A
WEEKDAY LIMITATION ON SUNDAYS SHE WENT TO CHURCH ELABORATED

MUCH OF MY UNASSISTED SELF AND MORE BY THE HELP OF BIDDY THAN OF MR
WOPSLES GREATAUNT I STRUGGLED THROUGH THE ALPHABET AS IF IT HAD BEEN
A BRAMBLEBUSH GETTING CONSIDERABLY WORRIED AND SCRATCHED BY EVERY
LETTER AFTER THAT I FELL AMONG THOSE THIEVES THE NINE FIGURES WHO
SEEMED EVERY EVENING TO DO SOMETHING NEW TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES AND
BAFFLE RECOGNITION BUT AT LAST I BEGAN IN A PURBLIND GROPING WAY TO
READ WRITE AND CIPHER ON THE VERY SMALLEST SCALE

ONE NIGHT I WAS SITTING IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER WITH MY SLATE EXPENDING
GREAT EFFORTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF A LETTER TO JOE I THINK IT MUST
HAVE BEEN A FULL YEAR AFTER OUR HUNT UPON THE MARSHES FOR IT WAS A
LONG TIME AFTER AND IT WAS WINTER AND A HARD FROST WITH AN ALPHABET
ON THE HEARTH AT MY FEET FOR REFERENCE I CONTRIVED IN AN HOUR OR TWO

BS

FEEL HIS WHISKER AND I HAD NO HOPE OF HIM WHENEVER HE TOOK TO THAT
PLACID OCCUPATION YOUR SISTERS A MASTERMIND A MASTERMIND

JOE WAS READIER WITH HIS DEFINITION THAN I HAD EXPECTED AND COMPLETELY
STOPPED ME BY ARGUING CIRCULARLY AND ANSWERING WITH A FIXED LOOK

YOUNG AS I WAS I BELIEVE THAT I DATED A NEW ADMIRATION OF JOE FROM
THAT NIGHT WE WERE EQUALS AFTERWARDS AS WE HAD BEEN BEFORE BUT
AFTERWARDS AT QUIET TIMES WHEN I SAT LOOKING AT JOE AND THINKING ABOUT
HIM I HAD A NEW SENSATION OF FEELING CONSCIOUS THAT I WAS LOOKING UP
TO JOE IN MY HEART

HOWEVER SAID JOE RISING TO REPLENISH THE FIRE HERES THE
DUTCHCLOCK AWORKING HIMSELF UP TO BEING EQUAL TO STRIKE EIGHT OF EM
AND SHES NOT COME HOME YET I HOPE UNCLE PUMBLECHOOKS MARE MAYNT
HAVE SET A FOREFOOT ON A PIECE O ICE AND GONE DOWN

MRS JOE MADE OCCASIONAL TRIPS WITH UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK ON MARKETDAYS
TO ASSIST HIM IN BUYING SUCH HOUSEHOLD STUFFS AND GOODS AS REQUIRED A
WOMANS JUDGMENT UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK BEING A BACHELOR AND REPOSING NO
CONFIDENCES IN HIS DOMESTIC SERVANT THIS WAS MARKETDAY AND MRS JOE
WAS OUT ON ONE OF THESE EXPEDITIONS

JOE MADE THE FIRE AND SWEPT THE HEARTH AND THEN WE WENT TO THE DOOR TO
LISTEN FOR THE CHAISECART IT WAS A DRY COLD NIGHT AND THE WIND BLEW
KEENLY AND THE FROST WAS WHITE AND HARD A MAN WOULD DIE TONIGHT OF
LYING OUT ON THE MARSHES I THOUGHT AND THEN I LOOKED AT THE STARS
AND CONSIDERED HOW AWFUL IT WOULD BE FOR A MAN TO TURN HIS FACE UP TO
THEM AS HE FROZE TO DEATH AND SEE NO HELP OR PITY IN ALL THE
GLITTERING MULTITUDE

HERE COMES THE MARE SAID JOE RINGING LIKE A PEAL OF BELLS

THE SOUND OF HER IRON SHOES UPON THE HARD ROAD WAS QUITE MUSICAL AS
SHE CAME ALONG AT A MUCH BRISKER TROT THAN USUAL WE GOT A CHAIR OUT
READY FOR MRS JOES ALIGHTING AND STIRRED UP THE FIRE THAT THEY MIGHT
SEE A BRIGHT WINDOW AND TOOK A FINAL SURVEY OF THE KITCHEN THAT
NOTHING MIGHT BE OUT OF ITS PLACE WHEN WE HAD COMPLETED THESE
PREPARATIONS THEY DROVE UP WRAPPED TO THE EYES MRS JOE WAS SOON
LANDED AND UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK WAS SOON DOWN TOO COVERING THE MARE WITH
A CLOTH AND WE WERE SOON ALL IN THE KITCHEN CARRYING SO MUCH COLD AIR
IN WITH US THAT IT SEEMED TO DRIVE ALL THE HEAT OUT OF THE FIRE

NOW SAID MRS JOE UNWRAPPING HERSELF WITH HASTE AND EXCITEMENT AND
THROWING HER BONNET BACK ON HER SHOULDERS WHERE IT HUNG BY THE STRINGS
IF THIS BOY AINT GRATEFUL THIS NIGHT HE NEVER WILL BE

I LOOKED AS GRATEFUL AS ANY BOY POSSIBLY COULD WHO WAS WHOLLY
UNINFORMED WHY HE OUGHT TO ASSUME THAT EXPRESSION

ITS ONLY TO BE HOPED SAID MY SISTER THAT HE WONT BE POMPEYED
BUT I HAVE MY FEARS

SHE AINT IN THAT LINE MUM SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK SHE KNOWS
BETTER

SHE I LOOKED AT JOE MAKING THE MOTION WITH MY LIPS AND EYEBROWS
SHE JOE LOOKED AT ME MAKING THE MOTION WITH HIS LIPS AND
EYEBROWS SHE MY SISTER CATCHING HIM IN THE ACT HE DREW THE BACK OF
HIS HAND ACROSS HIS NOSE WITH HIS USUAL CONCILIATORY AIR ON SUCH
OCCASIONS AND LOOKED AT HER

WELL SAID MY SISTER IN HER SNAPPISH WAY WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT
IS THE HOUSE AFIRE

WHICH SOME INDIVIDUAL JOE POLITELY HINTED MENTIONEDSHE

AND SHE IS A SHE I SUPPOSE SAID MY SISTER UNLESS YOU CALL MISS
HAVISHAM A HE AND I DOUBT IF EVEN YOULL GO SO FAR AS THAT

MISS HAVISHAM UP TOWN SAID JOE

IS THERE ANY MISS HAVISHAM DOWN TOWN RETURNED MY SISTER

SHE WANTS THIS BOY TO GO AND PLAY THERE AND OF COURSE HES GOING AND
HE HAD BETTER PLAY THERE SAID MY SISTER SHAKING HER HEAD AT ME AS AN
ENCOURAGEMENT TO BE EXTREMELY LIGHT AND SPORTIVE OR ILL WORK HIM

I HAD HEARD OF MISS HAVISHAM UP TOWNEVERYBODY FOR MILES ROUND HAD
HEARD OF MISS HAVISHAM UP TOWNAS AN IMMENSELY RICH AND GRIM LADY WHO
LIVED IN A LARGE AND DISMAL HOUSE BARRICADED AGAINST ROBBERS AND WHO
LED A LIFE OF SECLUSION

WELL TO BE SURE SAID JOE ASTOUNDED I WONDER HOW SHE COME TO KNOW
PIP

NOODLE CRIED MY SISTER WHO SAID SHE KNEW HIM

WHICH SOME INDIVIDUAL JOE AGAIN POLITELY HINTED MENTIONED THAT
SHE WANTED HIM TO GO AND PLAY THERE

AND COULDNT SHE ASK UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK IF HE KNEW OF A BOY TO GO AND
PLAY THERE ISNT IT JUST BARELY POSSIBLE THAT UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK MAY BE
A TENANT OF HERS AND THAT HE MAY SOMETIMESWE WONT SAY QUARTERLY OR
HALFYEARLY FOR THAT WOULD BE REQUIRING TOO MUCH OF YOUBUT
SOMETIMESGO THERE TO PAY HIS RENT AND COULDNT SHE THEN ASK UNCLE
PUMBLECHOOK IF HE KNEW OF A BOY TO GO AND PLAY THERE AND COULDNT
UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK BEING ALWAYS CONSIDERATE AND THOUGHTFUL FOR
USTHOUGH YOU MAY NOT THINK IT JOSEPH IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST
REPROACH AS IF HE WERE THE MOST CALLOUS OF NEPHEWS THEN MENTION THIS
BOY STANDING PRANCING HEREWHICH I SOLEMNLY DECLARE I WAS NOT
DOINGTHAT I HAVE FOR EVER BEEN A WILLING SLAVE TO

GOOD AGAIN CRIED UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK WELL PUT PRETTILY POINTED
GOOD INDEED NOW JOSEPH YOU KNOW THE CASE

NO JOSEPH SAID MY SISTER STILL IN A REPROACHFUL MANNER WHILE JOE
APOLOGETICALLY DREW THE BACK OF HIS HAND ACROSS AND ACROSS HIS NOSE
YOU DO NOT YETTHOUGH YOU MAY NOT THINK ITKNOW THE CASE YOU MAY
CONSIDER THAT YOU DO BUT YOU DO NOT JOSEPH FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW
THAT UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK BEING SENSIBLE THAT FOR ANYTHING WE CAN TELL
THIS BOYS FORTUNE MAY BE MADE BY HIS GOING TO MISS HAVISHAMS HAS
OFFERED TO TAKE HIM INTO TOWN TONIGHT IN HIS OWN CHAISECART AND TO
KEEP HIM TONIGHT AND TO TAKE HIM WITH HIS OWN HANDS TO MISS
HAVISHAMS TOMORROW MORNING AND LORAMUSSY ME CRIED MY SISTER
CASTING OFF HER BONNET IN SUDDEN DESPERATION HERE I STAND TALKING TO
MERE MOONCALFS WITH UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK WAITING AND THE MARE CATCHING
COLD AT THE DOOR AND THE BOY GRIMED WITH CROCK AND DIRT FROM THE HAIR
OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT

WITH THAT SHE POUNCED UPON ME LIKE AN EAGLE ON A LAMB AND MY FACE
WAS SQUEEZED INTO WOODEN BOWLS IN SINKS AND MY HEAD WAS PUT UNDER TAPS
OF WATERBUTTS AND I WAS SOAPED AND KNEADED AND TOWELLED AND
THUMPED AND HARROWED AND RASPED UNTIL I REALLY WAS QUITE BESIDE
MYSELF I MAY HERE REMARK THAT I SUPPOSE MYSELF TO BE BETTER
ACQUAINTED THAN ANY LIVING AUTHORITY WITH THE RIDGY EFFECT OF A
WEDDINGRING PASSING UNSYMPATHETICALLY OVER THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE

WHEN MY ABLUTIONS WERE COMPLETED I WAS PUT INTO CLEAN LINEN OF THE
STIFFEST CHARACTER LIKE A YOUNG PENITENT INTO SACKCLOTH AND WAS
TRUSSED UP IN MY TIGHTEST AND FEARFULLEST SUIT I WAS THEN DELIVERED
OVER TO MR PUMBLECHOOK WHO FORMALLY RECEIVED ME AS IF HE WERE THE
SHERIFF AND WHO LET OFF UPON ME THE SPEECH THAT I KNEW HE HAD BEEN
DYING TO MAKE ALL ALONG BOY BE FOREVER GRATEFUL TO ALL FRIENDS BUT
ESPECIALLY UNTO THEM WHICH BROUGHT YOU UP BY HAND

GOODBYE JOE

GOD BLESS YOU PIP OLD CHAP

I HAD NEVER PARTED FROM HIM BEFORE AND WHAT WITH MY FEELINGS AND WHAT
WITH SOAPSUDS I COULD AT FIRST SEE NO STARS FROM THE CHAISECART BUT
THEY TWINKLED OUT ONE BY ONE WITHOUT THROWING ANY LIGHT ON THE
QUESTIONS WHY ON EARTH I WAS GOING TO PLAY AT MISS HAVISHAMS AND WHAT
ON EARTH I WAS EXPECTED TO PLAY AT




CHAPTER VIII


MR PUMBLECHOOKS PREMISES IN THE HIGH STREET OF THE MARKET TOWN WERE
OF A PEPPERCORNY AND FARINACEOUS CHARACTER AS THE PREMISES OF A
CORNCHANDLER AND SEEDSMAN SHOULD BE IT APPEARED TO ME THAT HE MUST BE
A VERY HAPPY MAN INDEED TO HAVE SO MANY LITTLE DRAWERS IN HIS SHOP
AND I WONDERED WHEN I PEEPED INTO ONE OR TWO ON THE LOWER TIERS AND
SAW THE TIEDUP BROWN PAPER PACKETS INSIDE WHETHER THE FLOWERSEEDS
AND BULBS EVER WANTED OF A FINE DAY TO BREAK OUT OF THOSE JAILS AND
BLOOM

IT WAS IN THE EARLY MORNING AFTER MY ARRIVAL THAT I ENTERTAINED THIS
SPECULATION ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT I HAD BEEN SENT STRAIGHT TO BED IN
AN ATTIC WITH A SLOPING ROOF WHICH WAS SO LOW IN THE CORNER WHERE THE
BEDSTEAD WAS THAT I CALCULATED THE TILES AS BEING WITHIN A FOOT OF MY
EYEBROWS IN THE SAME EARLY MORNING I DISCOVERED A SINGULAR AFFINITY
BETWEEN SEEDS AND CORDUROYS MR PUMBLECHOOK WORE CORDUROYS AND SO DID
HIS SHOPMAN AND SOMEHOW THERE WAS A GENERAL AIR AND FLAVOUR ABOUT THE
CORDUROYS SO MUCH IN THE NATURE OF SEEDS AND A GENERAL AIR AND
FLAVOUR ABOUT THE SEEDS SO MUCH IN THE NATURE OF CORDUROYS THAT I
HARDLY KNEW WHICH WAS WHICH THE SAME OPPORTUNITY SERVED ME FOR
NOTICING THAT MR PUMBLECHOOK APPEARED TO CONDUCT HIS BUSINESS BY
LOOKING ACROSS THE STREET AT THE SADDLER WHO APPEARED TO TRANSACT
HIS BUSINESS BY KEEPING HIS EYE ON THE COACHMAKER WHO APPEARED TO
GET ON IN LIFE BY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND CONTEMPLATING
THE BAKER WHO IN HIS TURN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND STARED AT THE GROCER
WHO STOOD AT HIS DOOR AND YAWNED AT THE CHEMIST THE WATCHMAKER ALWAYS
PORING OVER A LITTLE DESK WITH A MAGNIFYINGGLASS AT HIS EYE AND
ALWAYS INSPECTED BY A GROUP OF SMOCKFROCKS PORING OVER HIM THROUGH THE
GLASS OF HIS SHOPWINDOW SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE
HIGH STREET WHOSE TRADE ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION

MR PUMBLECHOOK AND I BREAKFASTED AT EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE PARLOUR
BEHIND THE SHOP WHILE THE SHOPMAN TOOK HIS MUG OF TEA AND HUNCH OF
BREAD AND BUTTER ON A SACK OF PEAS IN THE FRONT PREMISES I CONSIDERED
MR PUMBLECHOOK WRETCHED COMPANY BESIDES BEING POSSESSED BY MY
SISTERS IDEA THAT A MORTIFYING AND PENITENTIAL CHARACTER OUGHT TO BE
IMPARTED TO MY DIETBESIDES GIVING ME AS MUCH CRUMB AS POSSIBLE IN
COMBINATION WITH AS LITTLE BUTTER AND PUTTING SUCH A QUANTITY OF WARM
WATER INTO MY MILK THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CANDID TO HAVE LEFT THE
MILK OUT ALTOGETHERHIS CONVERSATION CONSISTED OF NOTHING BUT
ARITHMETIC ON MY POLITELY BIDDING HIM GOODMORNING HE SAID
POMPOUSLY SEVEN TIMES NINE BOY AND HOW SHOULD I BE ABLE TO
ANSWER DODGED IN THAT WAY IN A STRANGE PLACE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH I
WAS HUNGRY BUT BEFORE I HAD SWALLOWED A MORSEL HE BEGAN A RUNNING SUM
THAT LASTED ALL THROUGH THE BREAKFAST SEVEN AND FOUR AND
EIGHT AND SIX AND TWO AND TEN AND SO ON AND AFTER EACH
FIGURE WAS DISPOSED OF IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO GET A BITE OR A
SUP BEFORE THE NEXT CAME WHILE HE SAT AT HIS EASE GUESSING NOTHING
AND EATING BACON AND HOT ROLL IN IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSION
A GORGING AND GORMANDIZING MANNER

FOR SUCH REASONS I WAS VERY GLAD WHEN TEN OCLOCK CAME AND WE STARTED
FOR MISS HAVISHAMS THOUGH I WAS NOT AT ALL AT MY EASE REGARDING THE
MANNER IN WHICH I SHOULD ACQUIT MYSELF UNDER THAT LADYS ROOF WITHIN A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE CAME TO MISS HAVISHAMS HOUSE WHICH WAS OF OLD
BRICK AND DISMAL AND HAD A GREAT MANY IRON BARS TO IT SOME OF THE
WINDOWS HAD BEEN WALLED UP OF THOSE THAT REMAINED ALL THE LOWER WERE
RUSTILY BARRED THERE WAS A COURTYARD IN FRONT AND THAT WAS BARRED SO
WE HAD TO WAIT AFTER RINGING THE BELL UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD COME TO
OPEN IT WHILE WE WAITED AT THE GATE I PEEPED IN EVEN THEN MR
PUMBLECHOOK SAID AND FOURTEEN BUT I PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM AND
SAW THAT AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS A LARGE BREWERY NO BREWING
WAS GOING ON IN IT AND NONE SEEMED TO HAVE GONE ON FOR A LONG LONG
TIME

A WINDOW WAS RAISED AND A CLEAR VOICE DEMANDED WHAT NAME TO WHICH
MY CONDUCTOR REPLIED PUMBLECHOOK THE VOICE RETURNED QUITE RIGHT
AND THE WINDOW WAS SHUT AGAIN AND A YOUNG LADY CAME ACROSS THE
COURTYARD WITH KEYS IN HER HAND

THIS SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK IS PIP

THIS IS PIP IS IT RETURNED THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS VERY PRETTY AND
SEEMED VERY PROUD COME IN PIP

MR PUMBLECHOOK WAS COMING IN ALSO WHEN SHE STOPPED HIM WITH THE GATE

OH SHE SAID DID YOU WISH TO SEE MISS HAVISHAM

IF MISS HAVISHAM WISHED TO SEE ME RETURNED MR PUMBLECHOOK
DISCOMFITED

AH SAID THE GIRL BUT YOU SEE SHE DONT

SHE SAID IT SO FINALLY AND IN SUCH AN UNDISCUSSIBLE WAY THAT MR
PUMBLECHOOK THOUGH IN A CONDITION OF RUFFLED DIGNITY COULD NOT
PROTEST BUT HE EYED ME SEVERELYAS IF I HAD DONE ANYTHING TO
HIMAND DEPARTED WITH THE WORDS REPROACHFULLY DELIVERED BOY LET
YOUR BEHAVIOUR HERE BE A CREDIT UNTO THEM WHICH BROUGHT YOU UP BY
HAND I WAS NOT FREE FROM APPREHENSION THAT HE WOULD COME BACK TO
PROPOUND THROUGH THE GATE AND SIXTEEN BUT HE DIDNT

MY YOUNG CONDUCTRESS LOCKED THE GATE AND WE WENT ACROSS THE COURTYARD
IT WAS PAVED AND CLEAN BUT GRASS WAS GROWING IN EVERY CREVICE THE
BREWERY BUILDINGS HAD A LITTLE LANE OF COMMUNICATION WITH IT AND THE
WOODEN GATES OF THAT LANE STOOD OPEN AND ALL THE BREWERY BEYOND STOOD
OPEN AWAY TO THE HIGH ENCLOSING WALL AND ALL WAS EMPTY AND DISUSED
THE COLD WIND SEEMED TO BLOW COLDER THERE THAN OUTSIDE THE GATE AND IT
MADE A SHRILL NOISE IN HOWLING IN AND OUT AT THE OPEN SIDES OF THE
BREWERY LIKE THE NOISE OF WIND IN THE RIGGING OF A SHIP AT SEA

SHE SAW ME LOOKING AT IT AND SHE SAID YOU COULD DRINK WITHOUT HURT
ALL THE STRONG BEER THATS BREWED THERE NOW BOY

I SHOULD THINK I COULD MISS SAID I IN A SHY WAY

BETTER NOT TRY TO BREW BEER THERE NOW OR IT WOULD TURN OUT SOUR BOY
DONT YOU THINK SO

IT LOOKS LIKE IT MISS

NOT THAT ANYBODY MEANS TO TRY SHE ADDED FOR THATS ALL DONE WITH
AND THE PLACE WILL STAND AS IDLE AS IT IS TILL IT FALLS AS TO STRONG
BEER THERES ENOUGH OF IT IN THE CELLARS ALREADY TO DROWN THE MANOR
HOUSE

ILLUSTRATION

IS THAT THE NAME OF THIS HOUSE MISS

ONE OF ITS NAMES BOY

IT HAS MORE THAN ONE THEN MISS

ONE MORE ITS OTHER NAME WAS SATIS WHICH IS GREEK OR LATIN OR
HEBREW OR ALL THREEOR ALL ONE TO MEFOR ENOUGH

ENOUGH HOUSE SAID I THATS A CURIOUS NAME MISS

YES SHE REPLIED BUT IT MEANT MORE THAN IT SAID IT MEANT WHEN IT
WAS GIVEN THAT WHOEVER HAD THIS HOUSE COULD WANT NOTHING ELSE THEY
MUST HAVE BEEN EASILY SATISFIED IN THOSE DAYS I SHOULD THINK BUT
DONT LOITER BOY

THOUGH SHE CALLED ME BOY SO OFTEN AND WITH A CARELESSNESS THAT WAS
FAR FROM COMPLIMENTARY SHE WAS OF ABOUT MY OWN AGE SHE SEEMED MUCH
OLDER THAN I OF COURSE BEING A GIRL AND BEAUTIFUL AND
SELFPOSSESSED AND SHE WAS AS SCORNFUL OF ME AS IF SHE HAD BEEN
ONEANDTWENTY AND A QUEEN

WE WENT INTO THE HOUSE BY A SIDE DOOR THE GREAT FRONT ENTRANCE HAD TWO
CHAINS ACROSS IT OUTSIDEAND THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT THE
PASSAGES WERE ALL DARK AND THAT SHE HAD LEFT A CANDLE BURNING THERE
SHE TOOK IT UP AND WE WENT THROUGH MORE PASSAGES AND UP A STAIRCASE
AND STILL IT WAS ALL DARK AND ONLY THE CANDLE LIGHTED US

AT LAST WE CAME TO THE DOOR OF A ROOM AND SHE SAID GO IN

I ANSWERED MORE IN SHYNESS THAN POLITENESS AFTER YOU MISS

TO THIS SHE RETURNED DONT BE RIDICULOUS BOY I AM NOT GOING IN
AND SCORNFULLY WALKED AWAY ANDWHAT WAS WORSETOOK THE CANDLE WITH
HER

THIS WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND I WAS HALF AFRAID HOWEVER THE ONLY
THING TO BE DONE BEING TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR I KNOCKED AND WAS TOLD
FROM WITHIN TO ENTER I ENTERED THEREFORE AND FOUND MYSELF IN A
PRETTY LARGE ROOM WELL LIGHTED WITH WAX CANDLES NO GLIMPSE OF
DAYLIGHT WAS TO BE SEEN IN IT IT WAS A DRESSINGROOM AS I SUPPOSED
FROM THE FURNITURE THOUGH MUCH OF IT WAS OF FORMS AND USES THEN QUITE
UNKNOWN TO ME BUT PROMINENT IN IT WAS A DRAPED TABLE WITH A GILDED
LOOKINGGLASS AND THAT I MADE OUT AT FIRST SIGHT TO BE A FINE LADYS
DRESSINGTABLE

WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE MADE OUT THIS OBJECT SO SOON IF THERE HAD BEEN NO
FINE LADY SITTING AT IT I CANNOT SAY IN AN ARMCHAIR WITH AN ELBOW
RESTING ON THE TABLE AND HER HEAD LEANING ON THAT HAND SAT THE
STRANGEST LADY I HAVE EVER SEEN OR SHALL EVER SEE

SHE WAS DRESSED IN RICH MATERIALSSATINS AND LACE AND SILKSALL OF
WHITE HER SHOES WERE WHITE AND SHE HAD A LONG WHITE VEIL DEPENDENT
FROM HER HAIR AND SHE HAD BRIDAL FLOWERS IN HER HAIR BUT HER HAIR WAS
WHITE SOME BRIGHT JEWELS SPARKLED ON HER NECK AND ON HER HANDS AND
SOME OTHER JEWELS LAY SPARKLING ON THE TABLE DRESSES LESS SPLENDID
THAN THE DRESS SHE WORE AND HALFPACKED TRUNKS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT
SHE HAD NOT QUITE FINISHED DRESSING FOR SHE HAD BUT ONE SHOE ONTHE
OTHER WAS ON THE TABLE NEAR HER HANDHER VEIL WAS BUT HALF ARRANGED
HER WATCH AND CHAIN WERE NOT PUT ON AND SOME LACE FOR HER BOSOM LAY
WITH THOSE TRINKETS AND WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AND GLOVES AND SOME
FLOWERS AND A PRAYERBOOK ALL CONFUSEDLY HEAPED ABOUT THE
LOOKINGGLASS

IT WAS NOT IN THE FIRST FEW MOMENTS THAT I SAW ALL THESE THINGS THOUGH
I SAW MORE OF THEM IN THE FIRST MOMENTS THAN MIGHT BE SUPPOSED BUT I
SAW THAT EVERYTHING WITHIN MY VIEW WHICH OUGHT TO BE WHITE HAD BEEN
WHITE LONG AGO AND HAD LOST ITS LUSTRE AND WAS FADED AND YELLOW I SAW
THAT THE BRIDE WITHIN THE BRIDAL DRESS HAD WITHERED LIKE THE DRESS AND
LIKE THE FLOWERS AND HAD NO BRIGHTNESS LEFT BUT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER
SUNKEN EYES I SAW THAT THE DRESS HAD BEEN PUT UPON THE ROUNDED FIGURE
OF A YOUNG WOMAN AND THAT THE FIGURE UPON WHICH IT NOW HUNG LOOSE HAD
SHRUNK TO SKIN AND BONE ONCE I HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SEE SOME GHASTLY
WAXWORK AT THE FAIR REPRESENTING I KNOW NOT WHAT IMPOSSIBLE PERSONAGE
LYING IN STATE ONCE I HAD BEEN TAKEN TO ONE OF OUR OLD MARSH CHURCHES
TO SEE A SKELETON IN THE ASHES OF A RICH DRESS THAT HAD BEEN DUG OUT OF
A VAULT UNDER THE CHURCH PAVEMENT NOW WAXWORK AND SKELETON SEEMED TO
HAVE DARK EYES THAT MOVED AND LOOKED AT ME I SHOULD HAVE CRIED OUT IF
I COULD

WHO IS IT SAID THE LADY AT THE TABLE

PIP MAAM

PIP

MR PUMBLECHOOKS BOY MAAM COMETO PLAY

COME NEARER LET ME LOOK AT YOU COME CLOSE

IT WAS WHEN I STOOD BEFORE HER AVOIDING HER EYES THAT I TOOK NOTE OF
THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS IN DETAIL AND SAW THAT HER WATCH HAD STOPPED
AT TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE AND THAT A CLOCK IN THE ROOM HAD STOPPED AT
TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE

LOOK AT ME SAID MISS HAVISHAM YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF A WOMAN WHO
HAS NEVER SEEN THE SUN SINCE YOU WERE BORN

I REGRET TO STATE THAT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF TELLING THE ENORMOUS LIE
COMPREHENDED IN THE ANSWER NO

DO YOU KNOW WHAT I TOUCH HERE SHE SAID LAYING HER HANDS ONE UPON
THE OTHER ON HER LEFT SIDE

YES MAAM IT MADE ME THINK OF THE YOUNG MAN

WHAT DO I TOUCH

YOUR HEART

BROKEN

SHE UTTERED THE WORD WITH AN EAGER LOOK AND WITH STRONG EMPHASIS AND
WITH A WEIRD SMILE THAT HAD A KIND OF BOAST IN IT AFTERWARDS SHE KEPT
HER HANDS THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND SLOWLY TOOK THEM AWAY AS IF
THEY WERE HEAVY

I AM TIRED SAID MISS HAVISHAM I WANT DIVERSION AND I HAVE DONE
WITH MEN AND WOMEN PLAY

I THINK IT WILL BE CONCEDED BY MY MOST DISPUTATIOUS READER THAT SHE
COULD HARDLY HAVE DIRECTED AN UNFORTUNATE BOY TO DO ANYTHING IN THE
WIDE WORLD MORE DIFFICULT TO BE DONE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES

I SOMETIMES HAVE SICK FANCIES SHE WENT ON AND I HAVE A SICK FANCY
THAT I WANT TO SEE SOME PLAY THERE THERE WITH AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT
OF THE FINGERS OF HER RIGHT HAND PLAY PLAY PLAY

FOR A MOMENT WITH THE FEAR OF MY SISTERS WORKING ME BEFORE MY EYES I
HAD A DESPERATE IDEA OF STARTING ROUND THE ROOM IN THE ASSUMED
CHARACTER OF MR PUMBLECHOOKS CHAISECART BUT I FELT MYSELF SO
UNEQUAL TO THE PERFORMANCE THAT I GAVE IT UP AND STOOD LOOKING AT MISS
HAVISHAM IN WHAT I SUPPOSE SHE TOOK FOR A DOGGED MANNER INASMUCH AS
SHE SAID WHEN WE HAD TAKEN A GOOD LOOK AT EACH OTHER

ARE YOU SULLEN AND OBSTINATE

NO MAAM I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU AND VERY SORRY I CANT PLAY JUST
NOW IF YOU COMPLAIN OF ME I SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE WITH MY SISTER SO
I WOULD DO IT IF I COULD BUT ITS SO NEW HERE AND SO STRANGE AND SO
FINEAND MELANCHOLY I STOPPED FEARING I MIGHT SAY TOO MUCH OR HAD
ALREADY SAID IT AND WE TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT EACH OTHER

BEFORE SHE SPOKE AGAIN SHE TURNED HER EYES FROM ME AND LOOKED AT THE
DRESS SHE WORE AND AT THE DRESSINGTABLE AND FINALLY AT HERSELF IN
THE LOOKINGGLASS

SO NEW TO HIM SHE MUTTERED SO OLD TO ME SO STRANGE TO HIM SO
FAMILIAR TO ME SO MELANCHOLY TO BOTH OF US CALL ESTELLA

AS SHE WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE REFLECTION OF HERSELF I THOUGHT SHE
WAS STILL TALKING TO HERSELF AND KEPT QUIET

CALL ESTELLA SHE REPEATED FLASHING A LOOK AT ME YOU CAN DO THAT
CALL ESTELLA AT THE DOOR

TO STAND IN THE DARK IN A MYSTERIOUS PASSAGE OF AN UNKNOWN HOUSE
BAWLING ESTELLA TO A SCORNFUL YOUNG LADY NEITHER VISIBLE NOR
RESPONSIVE AND FEELING IT A DREADFUL LIBERTY SO TO ROAR OUT HER NAME
WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS PLAYING TO ORDER BUT SHE ANSWERED AT LAST AND
HER LIGHT CAME ALONG THE DARK PASSAGE LIKE A STAR

MISS HAVISHAM BECKONED HER TO COME CLOSE AND TOOK UP A JEWEL FROM THE
TABLE AND TRIED ITS EFFECT UPON HER FAIR YOUNG BOSOM AND AGAINST HER
PRETTY BROWN HAIR YOUR OWN ONE DAY MY DEAR AND YOU WILL USE IT
WELL LET ME SEE YOU PLAY CARDS WITH THIS BOY

WITH THIS BOY WHY HE IS A COMMON LABOURINGBOY

I THOUGHT I OVERHEARD MISS HAVISHAM ANSWERONLY IT SEEMED SO
UNLIKELYWELL YOU CAN BREAK HIS HEART

WHAT DO YOU PLAY BOY ASKED ESTELLA OF MYSELF WITH THE GREATEST
DISDAIN

NOTHING BUT BEGGAR MY NEIGHBOUR MISS

BEGGAR HIM SAID MISS HAVISHAM TO ESTELLA SO WE SAT DOWN TO CARDS

IT WAS THEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM HAD
STOPPED LIKE THE WATCH AND THE CLOCK A LONG TIME AGO I NOTICED THAT
MISS HAVISHAM PUT DOWN THE JEWEL EXACTLY ON THE SPOT FROM WHICH SHE HAD
TAKEN IT UP AS ESTELLA DEALT THE CARDS I GLANCED AT THE
DRESSINGTABLE AGAIN AND SAW THAT THE SHOE UPON IT ONCE WHITE NOW
YELLOW HAD NEVER BEEN WORN I GLANCED DOWN AT THE FOOT FROM WHICH THE
SHOE WAS ABSENT AND SAW THAT THE SILK STOCKING ON IT ONCE WHITE NOW
YELLOW HAD BEEN TRODDEN RAGGED WITHOUT THIS ARREST OF EVERYTHING
THIS STANDING STILL OF ALL THE PALE DECAYED OBJECTS NOT EVEN THE
WITHERED BRIDAL DRESS ON THE COLLAPSED FORM COULD HAVE LOOKED SO LIKE
GRAVECLOTHES OR THE LONG VEIL SO LIKE A SHROUD

SO SHE SAT CORPSELIKE AS WE PLAYED AT CARDS THE FRILLINGS AND
TRIMMINGS ON HER BRIDAL DRESS LOOKING LIKE EARTHY PAPER I KNEW
NOTHING THEN OF THE DISCOVERIES THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY MADE OF BODIES
BURIED IN ANCIENT TIMES WHICH FALL TO POWDER IN THE MOMENT OF BEING
DISTINCTLY SEEN BUT I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SINCE THAT SHE MUST HAVE
LOOKED AS IF THE ADMISSION OF THE NATURAL LIGHT OF DAY WOULD HAVE
STRUCK HER TO DUST

HE CALLS THE KNAVES JACKS THIS BOY SAID ESTELLA WITH DISDAIN
BEFORE OUR FIRST GAME WAS OUT AND WHAT COARSE HANDS HE HAS AND WHAT
THICK BOOTS

I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING ASHAMED OF MY HANDS BEFORE BUT I BEGAN TO
CONSIDER THEM A VERY INDIFFERENT PAIR HER CONTEMPT FOR ME WAS SO
STRONG THAT IT BECAME INFECTIOUS AND I CAUGHT IT

SHE WON THE GAME AND I DEALT I MISDEALT AS WAS ONLY NATURAL WHEN I
KNEW SHE WAS LYING IN WAIT FOR ME TO DO WRONG AND SHE DENOUNCED ME FOR
A STUPID CLUMSY LABOURINGBOY

YOU SAY NOTHING OF HER REMARKED MISS HAVISHAM TO ME AS SHE LOOKED
ON SHE SAYS MANY HARD THINGS OF YOU BUT YOU SAY NOTHING OF HER WHAT
DO YOU THINK OF HER

I DONT LIKE TO SAY I STAMMERED

TELL ME IN MY EAR SAID MISS HAVISHAM BENDING DOWN

I THINK SHE IS VERY PROUD I REPLIED IN A WHISPER

ANYTHING ELSE

I THINK SHE IS VERY PRETTY

ANYTHING ELSE

I THINK SHE IS VERY INSULTING SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME THEN WITH A
LOOK OF SUPREME AVERSION

ANYTHING ELSE

I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO GO HOME

AND NEVER SEE HER AGAIN THOUGH SHE IS SO PRETTY

I AM NOT SURE THAT I SHOULDNT LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN BUT I SHOULD
LIKE TO GO HOME NOW

YOU SHALL GO SOON SAID MISS HAVISHAM ALOUD PLAY THE GAME OUT

SAVING FOR THE ONE WEIRD SMILE AT FIRST I SHOULD HAVE FELT ALMOST SURE
THAT MISS HAVISHAMS FACE COULD NOT SMILE IT HAD DROPPED INTO A
WATCHFUL AND BROODING EXPRESSIONMOST LIKELY WHEN ALL THE THINGS ABOUT
HER HAD BECOME TRANSFIXEDAND IT LOOKED AS IF NOTHING COULD EVER LIFT
IT UP AGAIN HER CHEST HAD DROPPED SO THAT SHE STOOPED AND HER VOICE
HAD DROPPED SO THAT SHE SPOKE LOW AND WITH A DEAD LULL UPON HER
ALTOGETHER SHE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING DROPPED BODY AND SOUL
WITHIN AND WITHOUT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A CRUSHING BLOW

I PLAYED THE GAME TO AN END WITH ESTELLA AND SHE BEGGARED ME SHE
THREW THE CARDS DOWN ON THE TABLE WHEN SHE HAD WON THEM ALL AS IF SHE
DESPISED THEM FOR HAVING BEEN WON OF ME

WHEN SHALL I HAVE YOU HERE AGAIN SAID MISS HAVISHAM LET ME THINK

I WAS BEGINNING TO REMIND HER THAT TODAY WAS WEDNESDAY WHEN SHE
CHECKED ME WITH HER FORMER IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF THE FINGERS OF HER
RIGHT HAND

THERE THERE I KNOW NOTHING OF DAYS OF THE WEEK I KNOW NOTHING OF
WEEKS OF THE YEAR COME AGAIN AFTER SIX DAYS YOU HEAR

YES MAAM

ESTELLA TAKE HIM DOWN LET HIM HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT AND LET HIM
ROAM AND LOOK ABOUT HIM WHILE HE EATS GO PIP

I FOLLOWED THE CANDLE DOWN AS I HAD FOLLOWED THE CANDLE UP AND SHE
STOOD IT IN THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD FOUND IT UNTIL SHE OPENED THE SIDE
ENTRANCE I HAD FANCIED WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT THAT IT MUST
NECESSARILY BE NIGHTTIME THE RUSH OF THE DAYLIGHT QUITE CONFOUNDED
ME AND MADE ME FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN IN THE CANDLELIGHT OF THE STRANGE
ROOM MANY HOURS

YOU ARE TO WAIT HERE YOU BOY SAID ESTELLA AND DISAPPEARED AND
CLOSED THE DOOR

I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ALONE IN THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AT MY
COARSE HANDS AND MY COMMON BOOTS MY OPINION OF THOSE ACCESSORIES WAS
NOT FAVOURABLE THEY HAD NEVER TROUBLED ME BEFORE BUT THEY TROUBLED ME
NOW AS VULGAR APPENDAGES I DETERMINED TO ASK JOE WHY HE HAD EVER
TAUGHT ME TO CALL THOSE PICTURECARDS JACKS WHICH OUGHT TO BE CALLED
KNAVES I WISHED JOE HAD BEEN RATHER MORE GENTEELLY BROUGHT UP AND
THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO TOO

SHE CAME BACK WITH SOME BREAD AND MEAT AND A LITTLE MUG OF BEER SHE
PUT THE MUG DOWN ON THE STONES OF THE YARD AND GAVE ME THE BREAD AND
MEAT WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME AS INSOLENTLY AS IF I WERE A DOG IN
DISGRACE I WAS SO HUMILIATED HURT SPURNED OFFENDED ANGRY SORRYI
CANNOT HIT UPON THE RIGHT NAME FOR THE SMARTGOD KNOWS WHAT ITS NAME
WASTHAT TEARS STARTED TO MY EYES THE MOMENT THEY SPRANG THERE THE
GIRL LOOKED AT ME WITH A QUICK DELIGHT IN HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF
THEM THIS GAVE ME POWER TO KEEP THEM BACK AND TO LOOK AT HER SO SHE
GAVE A CONTEMPTUOUS TOSSBUT WITH A SENSE I THOUGHT OF HAVING MADE
TOO SURE THAT I WAS SO WOUNDEDAND LEFT ME

BUT WHEN SHE WAS GONE I LOOKED ABOUT ME FOR A PLACE TO HIDE MY FACE
IN AND GOT BEHIND ONE OF THE GATES IN THE BREWERYLANE AND LEANED MY
SLEEVE AGAINST THE WALL THERE AND LEANED MY FOREHEAD ON IT AND CRIED
AS I CRIED I KICKED THE WALL AND TOOK A HARD TWIST AT MY HAIR SO
BITTER WERE MY FEELINGS AND SO SHARP WAS THE SMART WITHOUT A NAME
THAT NEEDED COUNTERACTION

MY SISTERS BRINGING UP HAD MADE ME SENSITIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD IN
WHICH CHILDREN HAVE THEIR EXISTENCE WHOSOEVER BRINGS THEM UP THERE IS
NOTHING SO FINELY PERCEIVED AND SO FINELY FELT AS INJUSTICE IT MAY BE
ONLY SMALL INJUSTICE THAT THE CHILD CAN BE EXPOSED TO BUT THE CHILD IS
SMALL AND ITS WORLD IS SMALL AND ITS ROCKINGHORSE STANDS AS MANY
HANDS HIGH ACCORDING TO SCALE AS A BIGBONED IRISH HUNTER WITHIN
MYSELF I HAD SUSTAINED FROM MY BABYHOOD A PERPETUAL CONFLICT WITH
INJUSTICE I HAD KNOWN FROM THE TIME WHEN I COULD SPEAK THAT MY
SISTER IN HER CAPRICIOUS AND VIOLENT COERCION WAS UNJUST TO ME I HAD
CHERISHED A PROFOUND CONVICTION THAT HER BRINGING ME UP BY HAND GAVE
HER NO RIGHT TO BRING ME UP BY JERKS THROUGH ALL MY PUNISHMENTS
DISGRACES FASTS AND VIGILS AND OTHER PENITENTIAL PERFORMANCES I HAD
NURSED THIS ASSURANCE AND TO MY COMMUNING SO MUCH WITH IT IN A
SOLITARY AND UNPROTECTED WAY I IN GREAT PART REFER THE FACT THAT I WAS
MORALLY TIMID AND VERY SENSITIVE

I GOT RID OF MY INJURED FEELINGS FOR THE TIME BY KICKING THEM INTO THE
BREWERY WALL AND TWISTING THEM OUT OF MY HAIR AND THEN I SMOOTHED MY
FACE WITH MY SLEEVE AND CAME FROM BEHIND THE GATE THE BREAD AND MEAT
WERE ACCEPTABLE AND THE BEER WAS WARMING AND TINGLING AND I WAS SOON
IN SPIRITS TO LOOK ABOUT ME

TO BE SURE IT WAS A DESERTED PLACE DOWN TO THE PIGEONHOUSE IN THE
BREWERYYARD WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN CROOKED ON ITS POLE BY SOME HIGH
WIND AND WOULD HAVE MADE THE PIGEONS THINK THEMSELVES AT SEA IF THERE
HAD BEEN ANY PIGEONS THERE TO BE ROCKED BY IT BUT THERE WERE NO
PIGEONS IN THE DOVECOT NO HORSES IN THE STABLE NO PIGS IN THE STY
NO MALT IN THE STOREHOUSE NO SMELLS OF GRAINS AND BEER IN THE COPPER
OR THE VAT ALL THE USES AND SCENTS OF THE BREWERY MIGHT HAVE
EVAPORATED WITH ITS LAST REEK OF SMOKE IN A BYYARD THERE WAS A
WILDERNESS OF EMPTY CASKS WHICH HAD A CERTAIN SOUR REMEMBRANCE OF
BETTER DAYS LINGERING ABOUT THEM BUT IT WAS TOO SOUR TO BE ACCEPTED AS
A SAMPLE OF THE BEER THAT WAS GONEAND IN THIS RESPECT I REMEMBER
THOSE RECLUSES AS BEING LIKE MOST OTHERS

BEHIND THE FURTHEST END OF THE BREWERY WAS A RANK GARDEN WITH AN OLD
WALL NOT SO HIGH BUT THAT I COULD STRUGGLE UP AND HOLD ON LONG ENOUGH
TO LOOK OVER IT AND SEE THAT THE RANK GARDEN WAS THE GARDEN OF THE
HOUSE AND THAT IT WAS OVERGROWN WITH TANGLED WEEDS BUT THAT THERE WAS
A TRACK UPON THE GREEN AND YELLOW PATHS AS IF SOME ONE SOMETIMES
WALKED THERE AND THAT ESTELLA WAS WALKING AWAY FROM ME EVEN THEN BUT
SHE SEEMED TO BE EVERYWHERE FOR WHEN I YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION
PRESENTED BY THE CASKS AND BEGAN TO WALK ON THEM I SAW HER WALKING
ON THEM AT THE END OF THE YARD OF CASKS SHE HAD HER BACK TOWARDS ME
AND HELD HER PRETTY BROWN HAIR SPREAD OUT IN HER TWO HANDS AND NEVER
LOOKED ROUND AND PASSED OUT OF MY VIEW DIRECTLY SO IN THE BREWERY
ITSELFBY WHICH I MEAN THE LARGE PAVED LOFTY PLACE IN WHICH THEY USED
TO MAKE THE BEER AND WHERE THE BREWING UTENSILS STILL WERE WHEN I
FIRST WENT INTO IT AND RATHER OPPRESSED BY ITS GLOOM STOOD NEAR THE
DOOR LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW HER PASS AMONG THE EXTINGUISHED FIRES AND
ASCEND SOME LIGHT IRON STAIRS AND GO OUT BY A GALLERY HIGH OVERHEAD
AS IF SHE WERE GOING OUT INTO THE SKY

IT WAS IN THIS PLACE AND AT THIS MOMENT THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
TO MY FANCY I THOUGHT IT A STRANGE THING THEN AND I THOUGHT IT A
STRANGER THING LONG AFTERWARDS I TURNED MY EYESA LITTLE DIMMED BY
LOOKING UP AT THE FROSTY LIGHTTOWARDS A GREAT WOODEN BEAM IN A LOW
NOOK OF THE BUILDING NEAR ME ON MY RIGHT HAND AND I SAW A FIGURE
HANGING THERE BY THE NECK A FIGURE ALL IN YELLOW WHITE WITH BUT ONE
SHOE TO THE FEET AND IT HUNG SO THAT I COULD SEE THAT THE FADED
TRIMMINGS OF THE DRESS WERE LIKE EARTHY PAPER AND THAT THE FACE WAS
MISS HAVISHAMS WITH A MOVEMENT GOING OVER THE WHOLE COUNTENANCE AS IF
SHE WERE TRYING TO CALL TO ME IN THE TERROR OF SEEING THE FIGURE AND
IN THE TERROR OF BEING CERTAIN THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN THERE A MOMENT
BEFORE I AT FIRST RAN FROM IT AND THEN RAN TOWARDS IT AND MY TERROR
WAS GREATEST OF ALL WHEN I FOUND NO FIGURE THERE

NOTHING LESS THAN THE FROSTY LIGHT OF THE CHEERFUL SKY THE SIGHT OF
PEOPLE PASSING BEYOND THE BARS OF THE COURTYARD GATE AND THE REVIVING
INFLUENCE OF THE REST OF THE BREAD AND MEAT AND BEER WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT ME ROUND EVEN WITH THOSE AIDS I MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO MYSELF
AS SOON AS I DID BUT THAT I SAW ESTELLA APPROACHING WITH THE KEYS TO
LET ME OUT SHE WOULD HAVE SOME FAIR REASON FOR LOOKING DOWN UPON ME I
THOUGHT IF SHE SAW ME FRIGHTENED AND SHE WOULD HAVE NO FAIR REASON

SHE GAVE ME A TRIUMPHANT GLANCE IN PASSING ME AS IF SHE REJOICED THAT
MY HANDS WERE SO COARSE AND MY BOOTS WERE SO THICK AND SHE OPENED THE
GATE AND STOOD HOLDING IT I WAS PASSING OUT WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER
WHEN SHE TOUCHED ME WITH A TAUNTING HAND

WHY DONT YOU CRY

BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO

YOU DO SAID SHE YOU HAVE BEEN CRYING TILL YOU ARE HALF BLIND AND
YOU ARE NEAR CRYING AGAIN NOW

SHE LAUGHED CONTEMPTUOUSLY PUSHED ME OUT AND LOCKED THE GATE UPON ME
I WENT STRAIGHT TO MR PUMBLECHOOKS AND WAS IMMENSELY RELIEVED TO
FIND HIM NOT AT HOME SO LEAVING WORD WITH THE SHOPMAN ON WHAT DAY I
WAS WANTED AT MISS HAVISHAMS AGAIN I SET OFF ON THE FOURMILE WALK TO
OUR FORGE PONDERING AS I WENT ALONG ON ALL I HAD SEEN AND DEEPLY
REVOLVING THAT I WAS A COMMON LABOURINGBOY THAT MY HANDS WERE COARSE
THAT MY BOOTS WERE THICK THAT I HAD FALLEN INTO A DESPICABLE HABIT OF
CALLING KNAVES JACKS THAT I WAS MUCH MORE IGNORANT THAN I HAD
CONSIDERED MYSELF LAST NIGHT AND GENERALLY THAT I WAS IN A LOWLIVED
BAD WAY




CHAPTER IX


WHEN I REACHED HOME MY SISTER WAS VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW ALL ABOUT MISS
HAVISHAMS AND ASKED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND I SOON FOUND MYSELF
GETTING HEAVILY BUMPED FROM BEHIND IN THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND THE
SMALL OF THE BACK AND HAVING MY FACE IGNOMINIOUSLY SHOVED AGAINST THE
KITCHEN WALL BECAUSE I DID NOT ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AT SUFFICIENT
LENGTH

IF A DREAD OF NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD BE HIDDEN IN THE BREASTS OF OTHER
YOUNG PEOPLE TO ANYTHING LIKE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT USED TO BE HIDDEN
IN MINEWHICH I CONSIDER PROBABLE AS I HAVE NO PARTICULAR REASON TO
SUSPECT MYSELF OF HAVING BEEN A MONSTROSITYIT IS THE KEY TO MANY
RESERVATIONS I FELT CONVINCED THAT IF I DESCRIBED MISS HAVISHAMS AS
MY EYES HAD SEEN IT I SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY THAT BUT I
FELT CONVINCED THAT MISS HAVISHAM TOO WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AND
ALTHOUGH SHE WAS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME I ENTERTAINED AN
IMPRESSION THAT THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING COARSE AND TREACHEROUS IN MY
DRAGGING HER AS SHE REALLY WAS TO SAY NOTHING OF MISS ESTELLA BEFORE
THE CONTEMPLATION OF MRS JOE CONSEQUENTLY I SAID AS LITTLE AS I
COULD AND HAD MY FACE SHOVED AGAINST THE KITCHEN WALL

THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THAT BULLYING OLD PUMBLECHOOK PREYED UPON BY
A DEVOURING CURIOSITY TO BE INFORMED OF ALL I HAD SEEN AND HEARD CAME
GAPING OVER IN HIS CHAISECART AT TEATIME TO HAVE THE DETAILS
DIVULGED TO HIM AND THE MERE SIGHT OF THE TORMENT WITH HIS FISHY EYES
AND MOUTH OPEN HIS SANDY HAIR INQUISITIVELY ON END AND HIS WAISTCOAT
HEAVING WITH WINDY ARITHMETIC MADE ME VICIOUS IN MY RETICENCE

WELL BOY UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK BEGAN AS SOON AS HE WAS SEATED IN THE
CHAIR OF HONOUR BY THE FIRE HOW DID YOU GET ON UP TOWN

I ANSWERED PRETTY WELL SIR AND MY SISTER SHOOK HER FIST AT ME

PRETTY WELL MR PUMBLECHOOK REPEATED PRETTY WELL IS NO ANSWER
TELL US WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRETTY WELL BOY

WHITEWASH ON THE FOREHEAD HARDENS THE BRAIN INTO A STATE OF OBSTINACY
PERHAPS ANYHOW WITH WHITEWASH FROM THE WALL ON MY FOREHEAD MY
OBSTINACY WAS ADAMANTINE I REFLECTED FOR SOME TIME AND THEN ANSWERED
AS IF I HAD DISCOVERED A NEW IDEA I MEAN PRETTY WELL

MY SISTER WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF IMPATIENCE WAS GOING TO FLY AT MEI
HAD NO SHADOW OF DEFENCE FOR JOE WAS BUSY IN THE FORGEWHEN MR
PUMBLECHOOK INTERPOSED WITH NO DONT LOSE YOUR TEMPER LEAVE THIS LAD
TO ME MAAM LEAVE THIS LAD TO ME MR PUMBLECHOOK THEN TURNED ME
TOWARDS HIM AS IF HE WERE GOING TO CUT MY HAIR AND SAID

FIRST TO GET OUR THOUGHTS IN ORDER FORTYTHREE PENCE

I CALCULATED THE CONSEQUENCES OF REPLYING FOUR HUNDRED POUND AND
FINDING THEM AGAINST ME WENT AS NEAR THE ANSWER AS I COULDWHICH WAS
SOMEWHERE ABOUT EIGHTPENCE OFF MR PUMBLECHOOK THEN PUT ME THROUGH MY
PENCETABLE FROM TWELVE PENCE MAKE ONE SHILLING UP TO FORTY PENCE
MAKE THREE AND FOURPENCE AND THEN TRIUMPHANTLY DEMANDED AS IF HE HAD
DONE FOR ME NOW HOW MUCH IS FORTYTHREE PENCE TO WHICH I
REPLIED AFTER A LONG INTERVAL OF REFLECTION I DONT KNOW AND I WAS
SO AGGRAVATED THAT I ALMOST DOUBT IF I DID KNOW

MR PUMBLECHOOK WORKED HIS HEAD LIKE A SCREW TO SCREW IT OUT OF ME AND
SAID IS FORTYTHREE PENCE SEVEN AND SIXPENCE THREE FARDENS FOR
INSTANCE

YES SAID I AND ALTHOUGH MY SISTER INSTANTLY BOXED MY EARS IT WAS
HIGHLY GRATIFYING TO ME TO SEE THAT THE ANSWER SPOILT HIS JOKE AND
BROUGHT HIM TO A DEAD STOP

BOY WHAT LIKE IS MISS HAVISHAM MR PUMBLECHOOK BEGAN AGAIN WHEN HE
HAD RECOVERED FOLDING HIS ARMS TIGHT ON HIS CHEST AND APPLYING THE
SCREW

VERY TALL AND DARK I TOLD HIM

IS SHE UNCLE ASKED MY SISTER

MR PUMBLECHOOK WINKED ASSENT FROM WHICH I AT ONCE INFERRED THAT HE
HAD NEVER SEEN MISS HAVISHAM FOR SHE WAS NOTHING OF THE KIND

GOOD SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK CONCEITEDLY THIS IS THE WAY TO HAVE
HIM WE ARE BEGINNING TO HOLD OUR OWN I THINK MUM

I AM SURE UNCLE RETURNED MRS JOE I WISH YOU HAD HIM ALWAYS YOU
KNOW SO WELL HOW TO DEAL WITH HIM

NOW BOY WHAT WAS SHE ADOING OF WHEN YOU WENT IN TODAY ASKED MR
PUMBLECHOOK

SHE WAS SITTING I ANSWERED IN A BLACK VELVET COACH

MR PUMBLECHOOK AND MRS JOE STARED AT ONE ANOTHERAS THEY WELL
MIGHTAND BOTH REPEATED IN A BLACK VELVET COACH

YES SAID I AND MISS ESTELLATHATS HER NIECE I THINKHANDED HER
IN CAKE AND WINE AT THE COACHWINDOW ON A GOLD PLATE AND WE ALL HAD
CAKE AND WINE ON GOLD PLATES AND I GOT UP BEHIND THE COACH TO EAT
MINE BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME TO

WAS ANYBODY ELSE THERE ASKED MR PUMBLECHOOK

FOUR DOGS SAID I

LARGE OR SMALL

IMMENSE SAID I AND THEY FOUGHT FOR VEALCUTLETS OUT OF A SILVER
BASKET

MR PUMBLECHOOK AND MRS JOE STARED AT ONE ANOTHER AGAIN IN UTTER
AMAZEMENT I WAS PERFECTLY FRANTICA RECKLESS WITNESS UNDER THE
TORTUREAND WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM ANYTHING

WHERE WAS THIS COACH IN THE NAME OF GRACIOUS ASKED MY SISTER

IN MISS HAVISHAMS ROOM THEY STARED AGAIN BUT THERE WERENT ANY
HORSES TO IT I ADDED THIS SAVING CLAUSE IN THE MOMENT OF REJECTING
FOUR RICHLY CAPARISONED COURSERS WHICH I HAD HAD WILD THOUGHTS OF
HARNESSING

CAN THIS BE POSSIBLE UNCLE ASKED MRS JOE WHAT CAN THE BOY MEAN

ILL TELL YOU MUM SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK MY OPINION IS ITS A
SEDANCHAIR SHES FLIGHTY YOU KNOWVERY FLIGHTYQUITE FLIGHTY
ENOUGH TO PASS HER DAYS IN A SEDANCHAIR

DID YOU EVER SEE HER IN IT UNCLE ASKED MRS JOE

HOW COULD I HE RETURNED FORCED TO THE ADMISSION WHEN I NEVER SEE
HER IN MY LIFE NEVER CLAPPED EYES UPON HER

GOODNESS UNCLE AND YET YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO HER

WHY DONT YOU KNOW SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK TESTILY THAT WHEN I HAVE
BEEN THERE I HAVE BEEN TOOK UP TO THE OUTSIDE OF HER DOOR AND THE
DOOR HAS STOOD AJAR AND SHE HAS SPOKE TO ME THAT WAY DONT SAY YOU
DONT KNOW THAT MUM HOWSEVER THE BOY WENT THERE TO PLAY WHAT DID
YOU PLAY AT BOY

WE PLAYED WITH FLAGS I SAID I BEG TO OBSERVE THAT I THINK OF
MYSELF WITH AMAZEMENT WHEN I RECALL THE LIES I TOLD ON THIS OCCASION

FLAGS ECHOED MY SISTER

YES SAID I ESTELLA WAVED A BLUE FLAG AND I WAVED A RED ONE AND
MISS HAVISHAM WAVED ONE SPRINKLED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE GOLD STARS OUT
AT THE COACHWINDOW AND THEN WE ALL WAVED OUR SWORDS AND HURRAHED

SWORDS REPEATED MY SISTER WHERE DID YOU GET SWORDS FROM

OUT OF A CUPBOARD SAID I AND I SAW PISTOLS IN ITAND JAMAND
PILLS AND THERE WAS NO DAYLIGHT IN THE ROOM BUT IT WAS ALL LIGHTED UP
WITH CANDLES

THATS TRUE MUM SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK WITH A GRAVE NOD THATS THE
STATE OF THE CASE FOR THAT MUCH IVE SEEN MYSELF AND THEN THEY BOTH
STARED AT ME AND I WITH AN OBTRUSIVE SHOW OF ARTLESSNESS ON MY
COUNTENANCE STARED AT THEM AND PLAITED THE RIGHT LEG OF MY TROUSERS
WITH MY RIGHT HAND

IF THEY HAD ASKED ME ANY MORE QUESTIONS I SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE
BETRAYED MYSELF FOR I WAS EVEN THEN ON THE POINT OF MENTIONING THAT
THERE WAS A BALLOON IN THE YARD AND SHOULD HAVE HAZARDED THE STATEMENT
BUT FOR MY INVENTION BEING DIVIDED BETWEEN THAT PHENOMENON AND A BEAR
IN THE BREWERY THEY WERE SO MUCH OCCUPIED HOWEVER IN DISCUSSING THE
MARVELS I HAD ALREADY PRESENTED FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION THAT I
ESCAPED THE SUBJECT STILL HELD THEM WHEN JOE CAME IN FROM HIS WORK TO
HAVE A CUP OF TEA TO WHOM MY SISTER MORE FOR THE RELIEF OF HER OWN
MIND THAN FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS RELATED MY PRETENDED
EXPERIENCES

NOW WHEN I SAW JOE OPEN HIS BLUE EYES AND ROLL THEM ALL ROUND THE
KITCHEN IN HELPLESS AMAZEMENT I WAS OVERTAKEN BY PENITENCE BUT ONLY
AS REGARDED HIMNOT IN THE LEAST AS REGARDED THE OTHER TWO TOWARDS
JOE AND JOE ONLY I CONSIDERED MYSELF A YOUNG MONSTER WHILE THEY SAT
DEBATING WHAT RESULTS WOULD COME TO ME FROM MISS HAVISHAMS
ACQUAINTANCE AND FAVOUR THEY HAD NO DOUBT THAT MISS HAVISHAM WOULD DO
SOMETHING FOR ME THEIR DOUBTS RELATED TO THE FORM THAT SOMETHING
WOULD TAKE MY SISTER STOOD OUT FOR PROPERTY MR PUMBLECHOOK WAS IN
FAVOUR OF A HANDSOME PREMIUM FOR BINDING ME APPRENTICE TO SOME GENTEEL
TRADESAY THE CORN AND SEED TRADE FOR INSTANCE JOE FELL INTO THE
DEEPEST DISGRACE WITH BOTH FOR OFFERING THE BRIGHT SUGGESTION THAT I
MIGHT ONLY BE PRESENTED WITH ONE OF THE DOGS WHO HAD FOUGHT FOR THE
VEALCUTLETS IF A FOOLS HEAD CANT EXPRESS BETTER OPINIONS THAN
THAT SAID MY SISTER AND YOU HAVE GOT ANY WORK TO DO YOU HAD BETTER
GO AND DO IT SO HE WENT

AFTER MR PUMBLECHOOK HAD DRIVEN OFF AND WHEN MY SISTER WAS WASHING
UP I STOLE INTO THE FORGE TO JOE AND REMAINED BY HIM UNTIL HE HAD
DONE FOR THE NIGHT THEN I SAID BEFORE THE FIRE GOES OUT JOE I
SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

SHOULD YOU PIP SAID JOE DRAWING HIS SHOEINGSTOOL NEAR THE FORGE
THEN TELL US WHAT IS IT PIP

JOE SAID I TAKING HOLD OF HIS ROLLEDUP SHIRT SLEEVE AND TWISTING

HAVISHAMS

AMAZEMENT YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY ITS

THERE WAS DOGS PIP COME PIP SAID JOE PERSUASIVELY IF THERE

AS I FIXED MY EYES HOPELESSLY ON JOE JOE CONTEMPLATED ME IN DISMAY
PIP OLD CHAP THIS WONT DO OLD FELLOW I SAY WHERE DO YOU EXPECT
TO GO TO

ITS TERRIBLE JOE AINT IT

TERRIBLE CRIED JOE AWFUL WHAT POSSESSED YOU

I DONT KNOW WHAT POSSESSED ME JOE I REPLIED LETTING HIS SHIRT
SLEEVE GO AND SITTING DOWN IN THE ASHES AT HIS FEET HANGING MY HEAD
BUT I WISH YOU HADNT TAUGHT ME TO CALL KNAVES AT CARDS JACKS AND I
WISH MY BOOTS WERENT SO THICK NOR MY HANDS SO COARSE

AND THEN I TOLD JOE THAT I FELT VERY MISERABLE AND THAT I HADNT BEEN
ABLE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO MRS JOE AND PUMBLECHOOK WHO WERE SO RUDE TO
ME AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY AT MISS HAVISHAMS
WHO WAS DREADFULLY PROUD AND THAT SHE HAD SAID I WAS COMMON AND THAT
I KNEW I WAS COMMON AND THAT I WISHED I WAS NOT COMMON AND THAT THE
LIES HAD COME OF IT SOMEHOW THOUGH I DIDNT KNOW HOW

THIS WAS A CASE OF METAPHYSICS AT LEAST AS DIFFICULT FOR JOE TO DEAL
WITH AS FOR ME BUT JOE TOOK THE CASE ALTOGETHER OUT OF THE REGION OF
METAPHYSICS AND BY THAT MEANS VANQUISHED IT

THERES ONE THING YOU MAY BE SURE OF PIP SAID JOE AFTER SOME
RUMINATION NAMELY THAT LIES IS LIES HOWSEVER THEY COME THEY DIDNT
OUGHT TO COME AND THEY COME FROM THE FATHER OF LIES AND WORK ROUND TO
THE SAME DONT YOU TELL NO MORE OF EM PIP THAT AINT THE WAY TO
GET OUT OF BEING COMMON OLD CHAP AND AS TO BEING COMMON I DONT MAKE
IT OUT AT ALL CLEAR YOU ARE ONCOMMON IN SOME THINGS YOURE ONCOMMON
SMALL LIKEWISE YOURE A ONCOMMON SCHOLAR

WELL PIP SAID JOE BE IT SO OR BE IT SONT YOU MUST BE A COMMON
SCHOLAR AFORE YOU CAN BE A ONCOMMON ONE I SHOULD HOPE THE KING UPON
HIS THRONE WITH HIS CROWN UPON HIS ED CANT SIT AND WRITE HIS ACTS OF
PARLIAMENT IN PRINT WITHOUT HAVING BEGUN WHEN HE WERE A UNPROMOTED
PRINCE WITH THE ALPHABETAH ADDED JOE WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD
THAT WAS FULL OF MEANING AND BEGUN AT A TOO AND WORKED HIS WAY TO Z
AND I KNOW WHAT THAT IS TO DO THOUGH I CANT SAY IVE EXACTLY DONE
IT

THERE WAS SOME HOPE IN THIS PIECE OF WISDOM AND IT RATHER ENCOURAGED
ME

WHETHER COMMON ONES AS TO CALLINGS AND EARNINGS PURSUED JOE
REFLECTIVELY MIGHTNT BE THE BETTER OF CONTINUING FOR TO KEEP COMPANY
WITH COMMON ONES INSTEAD OF GOING OUT TO PLAY WITH ONCOMMON
ONESWHICH REMINDS ME TO HOPE THAT THERE WERE A FLAG PERHAPS

NO JOE

IM SORRY THERE WERENT A FLAG PIP WHETHER THAT MIGHT BE OR
MIGHTNT BE IS A THING AS CANT BE LOOKED INTO NOW WITHOUT PUTTING
YOUR SISTER ON THE RAMPAGE AND THATS A THING NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS
BEING DONE INTENTIONAL LOOKEE HERE PIP AT WHAT IS SAID TO YOU BY A
TRUE FRIEND WHICH THIS TO YOU THE TRUE FRIEND SAY IF YOU CANT GET TO
BE ONCOMMON THROUGH GOING STRAIGHT YOULL NEVER GET TO DO IT THROUGH
GOING CROOKED SO DONT TELL NO MORE ON EM PIP AND LIVE WELL AND DIE
HAPPY

YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME JOE

NO OLD CHAP BUT BEARING IN MIND THAT THEM WERE WHICH I MEANTERSAY OF
A STUNNING AND OUTDACIOUS SORTALLUDING TO THEM WHICH BORDERED ON
WEALCUTLETS AND DOGFIGHTINGA SINCERE WELLWISHER WOULD ADWISE PIP
THEIR BEING DROPPED INTO YOUR MEDITATIONS WHEN YOU GO UPSTAIRS TO BED
THATS ALL OLD CHAP AND DONT NEVER DO IT NO MORE

WHEN I GOT UP TO MY LITTLE ROOM AND SAID MY PRAYERS I DID NOT FORGET
JOES RECOMMENDATION AND YET MY YOUNG MIND WAS IN THAT DISTURBED AND
UNTHANKFUL STATE THAT I THOUGHT LONG AFTER I LAID ME DOWN HOW COMMON
ESTELLA WOULD CONSIDER JOE A MERE BLACKSMITH HOW THICK HIS BOOTS AND
HOW COARSE HIS HANDS I THOUGHT HOW JOE AND MY SISTER WERE THEN SITTING
IN THE KITCHEN AND HOW I HAD COME UP TO BED FROM THE KITCHEN AND HOW
MISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA NEVER SAT IN A KITCHEN BUT WERE FAR ABOVE
THE LEVEL OF SUCH COMMON DOINGS I FELL ASLEEP RECALLING WHAT I USED
TO DO WHEN I WAS AT MISS HAVISHAMS AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THERE WEEKS
OR MONTHS INSTEAD OF HOURS AND AS THOUGH IT WERE QUITE AN OLD SUBJECT
OF REMEMBRANCE INSTEAD OF ONE THAT HAD ARISEN ONLY THAT DAY

THAT WAS A MEMORABLE DAY TO ME FOR IT MADE GREAT CHANGES IN ME BUT IT
IS THE SAME WITH ANY LIFE IMAGINE ONE SELECTED DAY STRUCK OUT OF IT
AND THINK HOW DIFFERENT ITS COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAUSE YOU WHO READ
THIS AND THINK FOR A MOMENT OF THE LONG CHAIN OF IRON OR GOLD OF
THORNS OR FLOWERS THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUND YOU BUT FOR THE
FORMATION OF THE FIRST LINK ON ONE MEMORABLE DAY




CHAPTER X


THE FELICITOUS IDEA OCCURRED TO ME A MORNING OR TWO LATER WHEN I WOKE
THAT THE BEST STEP I COULD TAKE TOWARDS MAKING MYSELF UNCOMMON WAS TO
GET OUT OF BIDDY EVERYTHING SHE KNEW IN PURSUANCE OF THIS LUMINOUS
CONCEPTION I MENTIONED TO BIDDY WHEN I WENT TO MR WOPSLES
GREATAUNTS AT NIGHT THAT I HAD A PARTICULAR REASON FOR WISHING TO
GET ON IN LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD FEEL VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER IF SHE
WOULD IMPART ALL HER LEARNING TO ME BIDDY WHO WAS THE MOST OBLIGING
OF GIRLS IMMEDIATELY SAID SHE WOULD AND INDEED BEGAN TO CARRY OUT HER
PROMISE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES

THE EDUCATIONAL SCHEME OR COURSE ESTABLISHED BY MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT
MAY BE RESOLVED INTO THE FOLLOWING SYNOPSIS THE PUPILS ATE APPLES AND
PUT STRAWS DOWN ONE ANOTHERS BACKS UNTIL MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT
COLLECTED HER ENERGIES AND MADE AN INDISCRIMINATE TOTTER AT THEM WITH
A BIRCHROD AFTER RECEIVING THE CHARGE WITH EVERY MARK OF DERISION
THE PUPILS FORMED IN LINE AND BUZZINGLY PASSED A RAGGED BOOK FROM HAND
TO HAND THE BOOK HAD AN ALPHABET IN IT SOME FIGURES AND TABLES AND A
LITTLE SPELLINGTHAT IS TO SAY IT HAD HAD ONCE AS SOON AS THIS
VOLUME BEGAN TO CIRCULATE MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT FELL INTO A STATE OF
COMA ARISING EITHER FROM SLEEP OR A RHEUMATIC PAROXYSM THE PUPILS
THEN ENTERED AMONG THEMSELVES UPON A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION ON THE
SUBJECT OF BOOTS WITH THE VIEW OF ASCERTAINING WHO COULD TREAD THE
HARDEST UPON WHOSE TOES THIS MENTAL EXERCISE LASTED UNTIL BIDDY MADE A
RUSH AT THEM AND DISTRIBUTED THREE DEFACED BIBLES SHAPED AS IF THEY
HAD BEEN UNSKILFULLY CUT OFF THE CHUMP END OF SOMETHING MORE
ILLEGIBLY PRINTED AT THE BEST THAN ANY CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE I HAVE
SINCE MET WITH SPECKLED ALL OVER WITH IRONMOULD AND HAVING VARIOUS
SPECIMENS OF THE INSECT WORLD SMASHED BETWEEN THEIR LEAVES THIS PART
OF THE COURSE WAS USUALLY LIGHTENED BY SEVERAL SINGLE COMBATS BETWEEN
BIDDY AND REFRACTORY STUDENTS WHEN THE FIGHTS WERE OVER BIDDY GAVE
OUT THE NUMBER OF A PAGE AND THEN WE ALL READ ALOUD WHAT WE COULDOR
WHAT WE COULDNTIN A FRIGHTFUL CHORUS BIDDY LEADING WITH A HIGH
SHRILL MONOTONOUS VOICE AND NONE OF US HAVING THE LEAST NOTION OF OR
REVERENCE FOR WHAT WE WERE READING ABOUT WHEN THIS HORRIBLE DIN HAD
LASTED A CERTAIN TIME IT MECHANICALLY AWOKE MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT
WHO STAGGERED AT A BOY FORTUITOUSLY AND PULLED HIS EARS THIS WAS
UNDERSTOOD TO TERMINATE THE COURSE FOR THE EVENING AND WE EMERGED INTO
THE AIR WITH SHRIEKS OF INTELLECTUAL VICTORY IT IS FAIR TO REMARK THAT
THERE WAS NO PROHIBITION AGAINST ANY PUPILS ENTERTAINING HIMSELF WITH
A SLATE OR EVEN WITH THE INK WHEN THERE WAS ANY BUT THAT IT WAS NOT
EASY TO PURSUE THAT BRANCH OF STUDY IN THE WINTER SEASON ON ACCOUNT OF
THE LITTLE GENERAL SHOP IN WHICH THE CLASSES WERE HOLDENAND WHICH WAS
ALSO MR WOPSLES GREATAUNTS SITTINGROOM AND BEDCHAMBERBEING BUT
FAINTLY ILLUMINATED THROUGH THE AGENCY OF ONE LOWSPIRITED DIPCANDLE
AND NO SNUFFERS

IT APPEARED TO ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO BECOME UNCOMMON UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES NEVERTHELESS I RESOLVED TO TRY IT AND THAT VERY
EVENING BIDDY ENTERED ON OUR SPECIAL AGREEMENT BY IMPARTING SOME
INFORMATION FROM HER LITTLE CATALOGUE OF PRICES UNDER THE HEAD OF
MOIST SUGAR AND LENDING ME TO COPY AT HOME A LARGE OLD ENGLISH D
WHICH SHE HAD IMITATED FROM THE HEADING OF SOME NEWSPAPER AND WHICH I
SUPPOSED UNTIL SHE TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS TO BE A DESIGN FOR A BUCKLE

OF COURSE THERE WAS A PUBLICHOUSE IN THE VILLAGE AND OF COURSE JOE
LIKED SOMETIMES TO SMOKE HIS PIPE THERE I HAD RECEIVED STRICT ORDERS
FROM MY SISTER TO CALL FOR HIM AT THE THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN THAT
EVENING ON MY WAY FROM SCHOOL AND BRING HIM HOME AT MY PERIL TO THE
THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN THEREFORE I DIRECTED MY STEPS

THERE WAS A BAR AT THE JOLLY BARGEMEN WITH SOME ALARMINGLY LONG CHALK
SCORES IN IT ON THE WALL AT THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO
BE NEVER PAID OFF THEY HAD BEEN THERE EVER SINCE I COULD REMEMBER AND
HAD GROWN MORE THAN I HAD BUT THERE WAS A QUANTITY OF CHALK ABOUT OUR
COUNTRY AND PERHAPS THE PEOPLE NEGLECTED NO OPPORTUNITY OF TURNING IT
TO ACCOUNT

IT BEING SATURDAY NIGHT I FOUND THE LANDLORD LOOKING RATHER GRIMLY AT
THESE RECORDS BUT AS MY BUSINESS WAS WITH JOE AND NOT WITH HIM I
MERELY WISHED HIM GOOD EVENING AND PASSED INTO THE COMMON ROOM AT THE
END OF THE PASSAGE WHERE THERE WAS A BRIGHT LARGE KITCHEN FIRE AND
WHERE JOE WAS SMOKING HIS PIPE IN COMPANY WITH MR WOPSLE AND A
STRANGER JOE GREETED ME AS USUAL WITH HALLOA PIP OLD CHAP AND THE
MOMENT HE SAID THAT THE STRANGER TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME

HE WAS A SECRETLOOKING MAN WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE HIS HEAD WAS
ALL ON ONE SIDE AND ONE OF HIS EYES WAS HALF SHUT UP AS IF HE WERE
TAKING AIM AT SOMETHING WITH AN INVISIBLE GUN HE HAD A PIPE IN HIS
MOUTH AND HE TOOK IT OUT AND AFTER SLOWLY BLOWING ALL HIS SMOKE AWAY
AND LOOKING HARD AT ME ALL THE TIME NODDED SO I NODDED AND THEN HE
NODDED AGAIN AND MADE ROOM ON THE SETTLE BESIDE HIM THAT I MIGHT SIT
DOWN THERE

BUT AS I WAS USED TO SIT BESIDE JOE WHENEVER I ENTERED THAT PLACE OF
RESORT I SAID NO THANK YOU SIR AND FELL INTO THE SPACE JOE MADE
FOR ME ON THE OPPOSITE SETTLE THE STRANGE MAN AFTER GLANCING AT JOE
AND SEEING THAT HIS ATTENTION WAS OTHERWISE ENGAGED NODDED TO ME AGAIN
WHEN I HAD TAKEN MY SEAT AND THEN RUBBED HIS LEGIN A VERY ODD WAY AS
IT STRUCK ME

YOU WAS SAYING SAID THE STRANGE MAN TURNING TO JOE THAT YOU WAS A
BLACKSMITH

YES I SAID IT YOU KNOW SAID JOE

WHATLL YOU DRINK MR YOU DIDNT MENTION YOUR NAME BY THE BYE

JOE MENTIONED IT NOW AND THE STRANGE MAN CALLED HIM BY IT WHATLL
YOU DRINK MR GARGERY AT MY EXPENSE TO TOP UP WITH

WELL SAID JOE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I AINT MUCH IN THE HABIT OF
DRINKING AT ANYBODYS EXPENSE BUT MY OWN

HABIT NO RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT ONCE AND AWAY AND ON A
SATURDAY NIGHT TOO COME PUT A NAME TO IT MR GARGERY

I WOULDNT WISH TO BE STIFF COMPANY SAID JOE RUM

RUM REPEATED THE STRANGER AND WILL THE OTHER GENTLEMAN ORIGINATE A
SENTIMENT

RUM SAID MR WOPSLE

THREE RUMS CRIED THE STRANGER CALLING TO THE LANDLORD GLASSES
ROUND

THIS OTHER GENTLEMAN OBSERVED JOE BY WAY OF INTRODUCING MR WOPSLE
IS A GENTLEMAN THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR GIVE IT OUT OUR CLERK AT
CHURCH

AHA SAID THE STRANGER QUICKLY AND COCKING HIS EYE AT ME THE
LONELY CHURCH RIGHT OUT ON THE MARSHES WITH GRAVES ROUND IT

THATS IT SAID JOE

THE STRANGER WITH A COMFORTABLE KIND OF GRUNT OVER HIS PIPE PUT HIS
LEGS UP ON THE SETTLE THAT HE HAD TO HIMSELF HE WORE A FLAPPING
BROADBRIMMED TRAVELLERS HAT AND UNDER IT A HANDKERCHIEF TIED OVER
HIS HEAD IN THE MANNER OF A CAP SO THAT HE SHOWED NO HAIR AS HE
LOOKED AT THE FIRE I THOUGHT I SAW A CUNNING EXPRESSION FOLLOWED BY A
HALFLAUGH COME INTO HIS FACE

I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THIS COUNTRY GENTLEMEN BUT IT SEEMS A
SOLITARY COUNTRY TOWARDS THE RIVER

MOST MARSHES IS SOLITARY SAID JOE

NO DOUBT NO DOUBT DO YOU FIND ANY GYPSIES NOW OR TRAMPS OR
VAGRANTS OF ANY SORT OUT THERE

NO SAID JOE NONE BUT A RUNAWAY CONVICT NOW AND THEN AND WE DONT
FIND THEM EASY EH MR WOPSLE

MR WOPSLE WITH A MAJESTIC REMEMBRANCE OF OLD DISCOMFITURE ASSENTED
BUT NOT WARMLY

SEEMS YOU HAVE BEEN OUT AFTER SUCH ASKED THE STRANGER

ONCE RETURNED JOE NOT THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE THEM YOU UNDERSTAND
WE WENT OUT AS LOOKERS ON ME AND MR WOPSLE AND PIP DIDNT US
PIP

YES JOE

THE STRANGER LOOKED AT ME AGAINSTILL COCKING HIS EYE AS IF HE WERE
EXPRESSLY TAKING AIM AT ME WITH HIS INVISIBLE GUNAND SAID HES A
LIKELY YOUNG PARCEL OF BONES THAT WHAT IS IT YOU CALL HIM

PIP SAID JOE

CHRISTENED PIP

NO NOT CHRISTENED PIP

SURNAME PIP

NO SAID JOE ITS A KIND OF FAMILY NAME WHAT HE GAVE HIMSELF WHEN A
INFANT AND IS CALLED BY

SON OF YOURS

WELL SAID JOE MEDITATIVELY NOT OF COURSE THAT IT COULD BE IN
ANYWISE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER ABOUT IT BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THE WAY AT
THE JOLLY BARGEMEN TO SEEM TO CONSIDER DEEPLY ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WAS
DISCUSSED OVER PIPESWELLNO NO HE AINT

NEVVY SAID THE STRANGE MAN

WELL SAID JOE WITH THE SAME APPEARANCE OF PROFOUND COGITATION HE
IS NOTNO NOT TO DECEIVE YOU HE IS NOTMY NEVVY

WHAT THE BLUE BLAZES IS HE ASKED THE STRANGER WHICH APPEARED TO ME
TO BE AN INQUIRY OF UNNECESSARY STRENGTH

MR WOPSLE STRUCK IN UPON THAT AS ONE WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT
RELATIONSHIPS HAVING PROFESSIONAL OCCASION TO BEAR IN MIND WHAT FEMALE
RELATIONS A MAN MIGHT NOT MARRY AND EXPOUNDED THE TIES BETWEEN ME AND
JOE HAVING HIS HAND IN MR WOPSLE FINISHED OFF WITH A MOST
TERRIFICALLY SNARLING PASSAGE FROM RICHARD THE THIRD AND SEEMED TO
THINK HE HAD DONE QUITE ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR IT WHEN HE ADDED AS
THE POET SAYS

AND HERE I MAY REMARK THAT WHEN MR WOPSLE REFERRED TO ME HE
CONSIDERED IT A NECESSARY PART OF SUCH REFERENCE TO RUMPLE MY HAIR AND
POKE IT INTO MY EYES I CANNOT CONCEIVE WHY EVERYBODY OF HIS STANDING
WHO VISITED AT OUR HOUSE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE PUT ME THROUGH THE SAME
INFLAMMATORY PROCESS UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES YET I DO NOT CALL TO
MIND THAT I WAS EVER IN MY EARLIER YOUTH THE SUBJECT OF REMARK IN OUR
SOCIAL FAMILY CIRCLE BUT SOME LARGEHANDED PERSON TOOK SOME SUCH
OPHTHALMIC STEPS TO PATRONISE ME

ALL THIS WHILE THE STRANGE MAN LOOKED AT NOBODY BUT ME AND LOOKED AT
ME AS IF HE WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE A SHOT AT ME AT LAST AND BRING ME
DOWN BUT HE SAID NOTHING AFTER OFFERING HIS BLUE BLAZES OBSERVATION
UNTIL THE GLASSES OF RUM AND WATER WERE BROUGHT AND THEN HE MADE HIS
SHOT AND A MOST EXTRAORDINARY SHOT IT WAS

IT WAS NOT A VERBAL REMARK BUT A PROCEEDING IN DUMBSHOW AND WAS
POINTEDLY ADDRESSED TO ME HE STIRRED HIS RUM AND WATER POINTEDLY AT
ME AND HE TASTED HIS RUM AND WATER POINTEDLY AT ME AND HE STIRRED IT
AND HE TASTED IT NOT WITH A SPOON THAT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM BUT WITH A
FILE

HE DID THIS SO THAT NOBODY BUT I SAW THE FILE AND WHEN HE HAD DONE IT
HE WIPED THE FILE AND PUT IT IN A BREASTPOCKET I KNEW IT TO BE JOES
FILE AND I KNEW THAT HE KNEW MY CONVICT THE MOMENT I SAW THE
INSTRUMENT I SAT GAZING AT HIM SPELLBOUND BUT HE NOW RECLINED ON
HIS SETTLE TAKING VERY LITTLE NOTICE OF ME AND TALKING PRINCIPALLY
ABOUT TURNIPS

THERE WAS A DELICIOUS SENSE OF CLEANINGUP AND MAKING A QUIET PAUSE
BEFORE GOING ON IN LIFE AFRESH IN OUR VILLAGE ON SATURDAY NIGHTS
WHICH STIMULATED JOE TO DARE TO STAY OUT HALF AN HOUR LONGER ON
SATURDAYS THAN AT OTHER TIMES THE HALFHOUR AND THE RUM AND WATER
RUNNING OUT TOGETHER JOE GOT UP TO GO AND TOOK ME BY THE HAND

STOP HALF A MOMENT MR GARGERY SAID THE STRANGE MAN I THINK IVE
GOT A BRIGHT NEW SHILLING SOMEWHERE IN MY POCKET AND IF I HAVE THE
BOY SHALL HAVE IT

HE LOOKED IT OUT FROM A HANDFUL OF SMALL CHANGE FOLDED IT IN SOME
CRUMPLED PAPER AND GAVE IT TO ME YOURS SAID HE MIND YOUR OWN

I THANKED HIM STARING AT HIM FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF GOOD MANNERS
AND HOLDING TIGHT TO JOE HE GAVE JOE GOODNIGHT AND HE GAVE MR
WOPSLE GOODNIGHT WHO WENT OUT WITH US AND HE GAVE ME ONLY A LOOK
WITH HIS AIMING EYENO NOT A LOOK FOR HE SHUT IT UP BUT WONDERS MAY
BE DONE WITH AN EYE BY HIDING IT

ON THE WAY HOME IF I HAD BEEN IN A HUMOUR FOR TALKING THE TALK MUST
HAVE BEEN ALL ON MY SIDE FOR MR WOPSLE PARTED FROM US AT THE DOOR OF
THE JOLLY BARGEMEN AND JOE WENT ALL THE WAY HOME WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE
OPEN TO RINSE THE RUM OUT WITH AS MUCH AIR AS POSSIBLE BUT I WAS IN A
MANNER STUPEFIED BY THIS TURNING UP OF MY OLD MISDEED AND OLD
ACQUAINTANCE AND COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE

MY SISTER WAS NOT IN A VERY BAD TEMPER WHEN WE PRESENTED OURSELVES IN
THE KITCHEN AND JOE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THAT UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE TO
TELL HER ABOUT THE BRIGHT SHILLING A BAD UN ILL BE BOUND SAID
MRS JOE TRIUMPHANTLY OR HE WOULDNT HAVE GIVEN IT TO THE BOY LETS
LOOK AT IT

I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PAPER AND IT PROVED TO BE A GOOD ONE BUT WHATS
THIS SAID MRS JOE THROWING DOWN THE SHILLING AND CATCHING UP THE
PAPER TWO ONEPOUND NOTES

NOTHING LESS THAN TWO FAT SWELTERING ONEPOUND NOTES THAT SEEMED TO
HAVE BEEN ON TERMS OF THE WARMEST INTIMACY WITH ALL THE CATTLEMARKETS
IN THE COUNTY JOE CAUGHT UP HIS HAT AGAIN AND RAN WITH THEM TO THE
JOLLY BARGEMEN TO RESTORE THEM TO THEIR OWNER WHILE HE WAS GONE I SAT
DOWN ON MY USUAL STOOL AND LOOKED VACANTLY AT MY SISTER FEELING PRETTY
SURE THAT THE MAN WOULD NOT BE THERE

PRESENTLY JOE CAME BACK SAYING THAT THE MAN WAS GONE BUT THAT HE
JOE HAD LEFT WORD AT THE THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN CONCERNING THE NOTES
THEN MY SISTER SEALED THEM UP IN A PIECE OF PAPER AND PUT THEM UNDER
SOME DRIED ROSELEAVES IN AN ORNAMENTAL TEAPOT ON THE TOP OF A PRESS IN
THE STATE PARLOUR THERE THEY REMAINED A NIGHTMARE TO ME MANY AND
MANY A NIGHT AND DAY

I HAD SADLY BROKEN SLEEP WHEN I GOT TO BED THROUGH THINKING OF THE
STRANGE MAN TAKING AIM AT ME WITH HIS INVISIBLE GUN AND OF THE
GUILTILY COARSE AND COMMON THING IT WAS TO BE ON SECRET TERMS OF
CONSPIRACY WITH CONVICTSA FEATURE IN MY LOW CAREER THAT I HAD
PREVIOUSLY FORGOTTEN I WAS HAUNTED BY THE FILE TOO A DREAD POSSESSED
ME THAT WHEN I LEAST EXPECTED IT THE FILE WOULD REAPPEAR I COAXED
MYSELF TO SLEEP BY THINKING OF MISS HAVISHAMS NEXT WEDNESDAY AND IN
MY SLEEP I SAW THE FILE COMING AT ME OUT OF A DOOR WITHOUT SEEING WHO
HELD IT AND I SCREAMED MYSELF AWAKE




CHAPTER XI


AT THE APPOINTED TIME I RETURNED TO MISS HAVISHAMS AND MY HESITATING
RING AT THE GATE BROUGHT OUT ESTELLA SHE LOCKED IT AFTER ADMITTING ME
AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE AND AGAIN PRECEDED ME INTO THE DARK PASSAGE
WHERE HER CANDLE STOOD SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF ME UNTIL SHE HAD THE
CANDLE IN HER HAND WHEN SHE LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER SUPERCILIOUSLY
SAYING YOU ARE TO COME THIS WAY TODAY AND TOOK ME TO QUITE ANOTHER
PART OF THE HOUSE

THE PASSAGE WAS A LONG ONE AND SEEMED TO PERVADE THE WHOLE SQUARE
BASEMENT OF THE MANOR HOUSE WE TRAVERSED BUT ONE SIDE OF THE SQUARE
HOWEVER AND AT THE END OF IT SHE STOPPED AND PUT HER CANDLE DOWN AND
OPENED A DOOR HERE THE DAYLIGHT REAPPEARED AND I FOUND MYSELF IN A
SMALL PAVED COURTYARD THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHICH WAS FORMED BY A
DETACHED DWELLINGHOUSE THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD ONCE BELONGED TO THE
MANAGER OR HEAD CLERK OF THE EXTINCT BREWERY THERE WAS A CLOCK IN THE
OUTER WALL OF THIS HOUSE LIKE THE CLOCK IN MISS HAVISHAMS ROOM AND
LIKE MISS HAVISHAMS WATCH IT HAD STOPPED AT TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE

WE WENT IN AT THE DOOR WHICH STOOD OPEN AND INTO A GLOOMY ROOM WITH A
LOW CEILING ON THE GROUNDFLOOR AT THE BACK THERE WAS SOME COMPANY IN
THE ROOM AND ESTELLA SAID TO ME AS SHE JOINED IT YOU ARE TO GO AND
STAND THERE BOY TILL YOU ARE WANTED THERE BEING THE WINDOW I
CROSSED TO IT AND STOOD THERE IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE STATE OF
MIND LOOKING OUT

IT OPENED TO THE GROUND AND LOOKED INTO A MOST MISERABLE CORNER OF THE
NEGLECTED GARDEN UPON A RANK RUIN OF CABBAGESTALKS AND ONE BOXTREE
THAT HAD BEEN CLIPPED ROUND LONG AGO LIKE A PUDDING AND HAD A NEW
GROWTH AT THE TOP OF IT OUT OF SHAPE AND OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR AS IF
THAT PART OF THE PUDDING HAD STUCK TO THE SAUCEPAN AND GOT BURNT THIS
WAS MY HOMELY THOUGHT AS I CONTEMPLATED THE BOXTREE THERE HAD BEEN
SOME LIGHT SNOW OVERNIGHT AND IT LAY NOWHERE ELSE TO MY KNOWLEDGE
BUT IT HAD NOT QUITE MELTED FROM THE COLD SHADOW OF THIS BIT OF
GARDEN AND THE WIND CAUGHT IT UP IN LITTLE EDDIES AND THREW IT AT THE
WINDOW AS IF IT PELTED ME FOR COMING THERE

I DIVINED THAT MY COMING HAD STOPPED CONVERSATION IN THE ROOM AND THAT
ITS OTHER OCCUPANTS WERE LOOKING AT ME I COULD SEE NOTHING OF THE ROOM
EXCEPT THE SHINING OF THE FIRE IN THE WINDOWGLASS BUT I STIFFENED IN
ALL MY JOINTS WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I WAS UNDER CLOSE INSPECTION

THERE WERE THREE LADIES IN THE ROOM AND ONE GENTLEMAN BEFORE I HAD
BEEN STANDING AT THE WINDOW FIVE MINUTES THEY SOMEHOW CONVEYED TO ME
THAT THEY WERE ALL TOADIES AND HUMBUGS BUT THAT EACH OF THEM PRETENDED
NOT TO KNOW THAT THE OTHERS WERE TOADIES AND HUMBUGS BECAUSE THE
ADMISSION THAT HE OR SHE DID KNOW IT WOULD HAVE MADE HIM OR HER OUT TO
BE A TOADY AND HUMBUG

THEY ALL HAD A LISTLESS AND DREARY AIR OF WAITING SOMEBODYS PLEASURE
AND THE MOST TALKATIVE OF THE LADIES HAD TO SPEAK QUITE RIGIDLY TO
REPRESS A YAWN THIS LADY WHOSE NAME WAS CAMILLA VERY MUCH REMINDED
ME OF MY SISTER WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT SHE WAS OLDER AND AS I
FOUND WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER OF A BLUNTER CAST OF FEATURES
INDEED WHEN I KNEW HER BETTER I BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS A MERCY SHE HAD
ANY FEATURES AT ALL SO VERY BLANK AND HIGH WAS THE DEAD WALL OF HER
FACE

POOR DEAR SOUL SAID THIS LADY WITH AN ABRUPTNESS OF MANNER QUITE MY
SISTERS NOBODYS ENEMY BUT HIS OWN

IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE COMMENDABLE TO BE SOMEBODY ELSES ENEMY SAID
THE GENTLEMAN FAR MORE NATURAL

COUSIN RAYMOND OBSERVED ANOTHER LADY WE ARE TO LOVE OUR
NEIGHBOUR

SARAH POCKET RETURNED COUSIN RAYMOND IF A MAN IS NOT HIS OWN
NEIGHBOUR WHO IS

MISS POCKET LAUGHED AND CAMILLA LAUGHED AND SAID CHECKING A YAWN
THE IDEA BUT I THOUGHT THEY SEEMED TO THINK IT RATHER A GOOD IDEA
TOO THE OTHER LADY WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN YET SAID GRAVELY AND
EMPHATICALLY VERY TRUE

POOR SOUL CAMILLA PRESENTLY WENT ON I KNEW THEY HAD ALL BEEN
LOOKING AT ME IN THE MEAN TIME HE IS SO VERY STRANGE WOULD ANYONE
BELIEVE THAT WHEN TOMS WIFE DIED HE ACTUALLY COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO
SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILDRENS HAVING THE DEEPEST OF TRIMMINGS TO
THEIR MOURNING GOOD LORD SAYS HE CAMILLA WHAT CAN IT SIGNIFY SO
LONG AS THE POOR BEREAVED LITTLE THINGS ARE IN BLACK SO LIKE MATTHEW
THE IDEA

GOOD POINTS IN HIM GOOD POINTS IN HIM SAID COUSIN RAYMOND HEAVEN
FORBID I SHOULD DENY GOOD POINTS IN HIM BUT HE NEVER HAD AND HE NEVER
WILL HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES

YOU KNOW I WAS OBLIGED SAID CAMILLAI WAS OBLIGED TO BE FIRM I
SAID IT WILL NOT DO FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY I TOLD HIM THAT
WITHOUT DEEP TRIMMINGS THE FAMILY WAS DISGRACED I CRIED ABOUT IT FROM
BREAKFAST TILL DINNER I INJURED MY DIGESTION AND AT LAST HE FLUNG OUT
IN HIS VIOLENT WAY AND SAID WITH A D THEN DO AS YOU LIKE THANK
GOODNESS IT WILL ALWAYS BE A CONSOLATION TO ME TO KNOW THAT I INSTANTLY
WENT OUT IN A POURING RAIN AND BOUGHT THE THINGS

HE PAID FOR THEM DID HE NOT ASKED ESTELLA

ITS NOT THE QUESTION MY DEAR CHILD WHO PAID FOR THEM RETURNED
CAMILLA I BOUGHT THEM AND I SHALL OFTEN THINK OF THAT WITH PEACE
WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT

THE RINGING OF A DISTANT BELL COMBINED WITH THE ECHOING OF SOME CRY OR
CALL ALONG THE PASSAGE BY WHICH I HAD COME INTERRUPTED THE
CONVERSATION AND CAUSED ESTELLA TO SAY TO ME NOW BOY ON MY TURNING
ROUND THEY ALL LOOKED AT ME WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT AND AS I WENT
OUT I HEARD SARAH POCKET SAY WELL I AM SURE WHAT NEXT AND CAMILLA
ADD WITH INDIGNATION WAS THERE EVER SUCH A FANCY THE IDEA

AS WE WERE GOING WITH OUR CANDLE ALONG THE DARK PASSAGE ESTELLA
STOPPED ALL OF A SUDDEN AND FACING ROUND SAID IN HER TAUNTING
MANNER WITH HER FACE QUITE CLOSE TO MINE

WELL

WELL MISS I ANSWERED ALMOST FALLING OVER HER AND CHECKING MYSELF

SHE STOOD LOOKING AT ME AND OF COURSE I STOOD LOOKING AT HER

AM I PRETTY

YES I THINK YOU ARE VERY PRETTY

AM I INSULTING

NOT SO MUCH SO AS YOU WERE LAST TIME SAID I

NOT SO MUCH SO

NO

SHE FIRED WHEN SHE ASKED THE LAST QUESTION AND SHE SLAPPED MY FACE
WITH SUCH FORCE AS SHE HAD WHEN I ANSWERED IT

NOW SAID SHE YOU LITTLE COARSE MONSTER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME
NOW

I SHALL NOT TELL YOU

BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO TELL UPSTAIRS IS THAT IT

NO SAID I THATS NOT IT

WHY DONT YOU CRY AGAIN YOU LITTLE WRETCH

BECAUSE ILL NEVER CRY FOR YOU AGAIN SAID I WHICH WAS I SUPPOSE
AS FALSE A DECLARATION AS EVER WAS MADE FOR I WAS INWARDLY CRYING FOR
HER THEN AND I KNOW WHAT I KNOW OF THE PAIN SHE COST ME AFTERWARDS

WE WENT ON OUR WAY UPSTAIRS AFTER THIS EPISODE AND AS WE WERE GOING
UP WE MET A GENTLEMAN GROPING HIS WAY DOWN

WHOM HAVE WE HERE ASKED THE GENTLEMAN STOPPING AND LOOKING AT ME

A BOY SAID ESTELLA

HE WAS A BURLY MAN OF AN EXCEEDINGLY DARK COMPLEXION WITH AN
EXCEEDINGLY LARGE HEAD AND A CORRESPONDING LARGE HAND HE TOOK MY CHIN
IN HIS LARGE HAND AND TURNED UP MY FACE TO HAVE A LOOK AT ME BY THE
LIGHT OF THE CANDLE HE WAS PREMATURELY BALD ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
AND HAD BUSHY BLACK EYEBROWS THAT WOULDNT LIE DOWN BUT STOOD UP
BRISTLING HIS EYES WERE SET VERY DEEP IN HIS HEAD AND WERE
DISAGREEABLY SHARP AND SUSPICIOUS HE HAD A LARGE WATCHCHAIN AND
STRONG BLACK DOTS WHERE HIS BEARD AND WHISKERS WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE
HAD LET THEM HE WAS NOTHING TO ME AND I COULD HAVE HAD NO FORESIGHT
THEN THAT HE EVER WOULD BE ANYTHING TO ME BUT IT HAPPENED THAT I HAD
THIS OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING HIM WELL

BOY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HEY SAID HE

YES SIR SAID I

HOW DO YOU COME HERE

MISS HAVISHAM SENT FOR ME SIR I EXPLAINED

WELL BEHAVE YOURSELF I HAVE A PRETTY LARGE EXPERIENCE OF BOYS AND
YOURE A BAD SET OF FELLOWS NOW MIND SAID HE BITING THE SIDE OF HIS
GREAT FOREFINGER AS HE FROWNED AT ME YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF

WITH THOSE WORDS HE RELEASED MEWHICH I WAS GLAD OF FOR HIS HAND
SMELT OF SCENTED SOAPAND WENT HIS WAY DOWNSTAIRS I WONDERED WHETHER
HE COULD BE A DOCTOR BUT NO I THOUGHT HE COULDNT BE A DOCTOR OR HE
WOULD HAVE A QUIETER AND MORE PERSUASIVE MANNER THERE WAS NOT MUCH
TIME TO CONSIDER THE SUBJECT FOR WE WERE SOON IN MISS HAVISHAMS ROOM
WHERE SHE AND EVERYTHING ELSE WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFT THEM ESTELLA
LEFT ME STANDING NEAR THE DOOR AND I STOOD THERE UNTIL MISS HAVISHAM
CAST HER EYES UPON ME FROM THE DRESSINGTABLE

SO SHE SAID WITHOUT BEING STARTLED OR SURPRISED THE DAYS HAVE
WORN AWAY HAVE THEY

YES MAAM TODAY IS

THERE THERE THERE WITH THE IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER FINGERS I
DONT WANT TO KNOW ARE YOU READY TO PLAY

I WAS OBLIGED TO ANSWER IN SOME CONFUSION I DONT THINK I AM MAAM

NOT AT CARDS AGAIN SHE DEMANDED WITH A SEARCHING LOOK

YES MAAM I COULD DO THAT IF I WAS WANTED

SINCE THIS HOUSE STRIKES YOU OLD AND GRAVE BOY SAID MISS HAVISHAM
IMPATIENTLY AND YOU ARE UNWILLING TO PLAY ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK

I COULD ANSWER THIS INQUIRY WITH A BETTER HEART THAN I HAD BEEN ABLE TO
FIND FOR THE OTHER QUESTION AND I SAID I WAS QUITE WILLING

THEN GO INTO THAT OPPOSITE ROOM SAID SHE POINTING AT THE DOOR
BEHIND ME WITH HER WITHERED HAND AND WAIT THERE TILL I COME

I CROSSED THE STAIRCASE LANDING AND ENTERED THE ROOM SHE INDICATED
FROM THAT ROOM TOO THE DAYLIGHT WAS COMPLETELY EXCLUDED AND IT HAD
AN AIRLESS SMELL THAT WAS OPPRESSIVE A FIRE HAD BEEN LATELY KINDLED IN
THE DAMP OLDFASHIONED GRATE AND IT WAS MORE DISPOSED TO GO OUT THAN
TO BURN UP AND THE RELUCTANT SMOKE WHICH HUNG IN THE ROOM SEEMED
COLDER THAN THE CLEARER AIRLIKE OUR OWN MARSH MIST CERTAIN WINTRY
BRANCHES OF CANDLES ON THE HIGH CHIMNEYPIECE FAINTLY LIGHTED THE
CHAMBER OR IT WOULD BE MORE EXPRESSIVE TO SAY FAINTLY TROUBLED ITS
DARKNESS IT WAS SPACIOUS AND I DARE SAY HAD ONCE BEEN HANDSOME BUT
EVERY DISCERNIBLE THING IN IT WAS COVERED WITH DUST AND MOULD AND
DROPPING TO PIECES THE MOST PROMINENT OBJECT WAS A LONG TABLE WITH A
TABLECLOTH SPREAD ON IT AS IF A FEAST HAD BEEN IN PREPARATION WHEN THE
HOUSE AND THE CLOCKS ALL STOPPED TOGETHER AN EPERGNE OR CENTREPIECE
OF SOME KIND WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CLOTH IT WAS SO HEAVILY
OVERHUNG WITH COBWEBS THAT ITS FORM WAS QUITE UNDISTINGUISHABLE AND
AS I LOOKED ALONG THE YELLOW EXPANSE OUT OF WHICH I REMEMBER ITS
SEEMING TO GROW LIKE A BLACK FUNGUS I SAW SPECKLELEGGED SPIDERS WITH
BLOTCHY BODIES RUNNING HOME TO IT AND RUNNING OUT FROM IT AS IF SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE GREATEST PUBLIC IMPORTANCE HAD JUST TRANSPIRED IN
THE SPIDER COMMUNITY

I HEARD THE MICE TOO RATTLING BEHIND THE PANELS AS IF THE SAME
OCCURRENCE WERE IMPORTANT TO THEIR INTERESTS BUT THE BLACK BEETLES
TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE AGITATION AND GROPED ABOUT THE HEARTH IN A
PONDEROUS ELDERLY WAY AS IF THEY WERE SHORTSIGHTED AND HARD OF
HEARING AND NOT ON TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER

THESE CRAWLING THINGS HAD FASCINATED MY ATTENTION AND I WAS WATCHING
THEM FROM A DISTANCE WHEN MISS HAVISHAM LAID A HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
IN HER OTHER HAND SHE HAD A CRUTCHHEADED STICK ON WHICH SHE LEANED
AND SHE LOOKED LIKE THE WITCH OF THE PLACE

THIS SAID SHE POINTING TO THE LONG TABLE WITH HER STICK IS WHERE
I WILL BE LAID WHEN I AM DEAD THEY SHALL COME AND LOOK AT ME HERE

WITH SOME VAGUE MISGIVING THAT SHE MIGHT GET UPON THE TABLE THEN AND
THERE AND DIE AT ONCE THE COMPLETE REALISATION OF THE GHASTLY WAXWORK
AT THE FAIR I SHRANK UNDER HER TOUCH

WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS SHE ASKED ME AGAIN POINTING WITH HER
STICK THAT WHERE THOSE COBWEBS ARE

I CANT GUESS WHAT IT IS MAAM

ITS A GREAT CAKE A BRIDECAKE MINE

SHE LOOKED ALL ROUND THE ROOM IN A GLARING MANNER AND THEN SAID
LEANING ON ME WHILE HER HAND TWITCHED MY SHOULDER COME COME COME
WALK ME WALK ME

I MADE OUT FROM THIS THAT THE WORK I HAD TO DO WAS TO WALK MISS
HAVISHAM ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM ACCORDINGLY I STARTED AT ONCE AND
SHE LEANED UPON MY SHOULDER AND WE WENT AWAY AT A PACE THAT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN AN IMITATION FOUNDED ON MY FIRST IMPULSE UNDER THAT ROOF OF MR
PUMBLECHOOKS CHAISECART

SHE WAS NOT PHYSICALLY STRONG AND AFTER A LITTLE TIME SAID SLOWER
STILL WE WENT AT AN IMPATIENT FITFUL SPEED AND AS WE WENT SHE
TWITCHED THE HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND WORKED HER MOUTH AND LED ME TO
BELIEVE THAT WE WERE GOING FAST BECAUSE HER THOUGHTS WENT FAST AFTER A
WHILE SHE SAID CALL ESTELLA SO I WENT OUT ON THE LANDING AND ROARED
THAT NAME AS I HAD DONE ON THE PREVIOUS OCCASION WHEN HER LIGHT
APPEARED I RETURNED TO MISS HAVISHAM AND WE STARTED AWAY AGAIN ROUND
AND ROUND THE ROOM

IF ONLY ESTELLA HAD COME TO BE A SPECTATOR OF OUR PROCEEDINGS I SHOULD
HAVE FELT SUFFICIENTLY DISCONTENTED BUT AS SHE BROUGHT WITH HER THE
THREE LADIES AND THE GENTLEMAN WHOM I HAD SEEN BELOW I DIDNT KNOW
WHAT TO DO IN MY POLITENESS I WOULD HAVE STOPPED BUT MISS HAVISHAM
TWITCHED MY SHOULDER AND WE POSTED ONWITH A SHAMEFACED
CONSCIOUSNESS ON MY PART THAT THEY WOULD THINK IT WAS ALL MY DOING

DEAR MISS HAVISHAM SAID MISS SARAH POCKET HOW WELL YOU LOOK

I DO NOT RETURNED MISS HAVISHAM I AM YELLOW SKIN AND BONE

CAMILLA BRIGHTENED WHEN MISS POCKET MET WITH THIS REBUFF AND SHE
MURMURED AS SHE PLAINTIVELY CONTEMPLATED MISS HAVISHAM POOR DEAR
SOUL CERTAINLY NOT TO BE EXPECTED TO LOOK WELL POOR THING THE IDEA

AND HOW ARE YOU SAID MISS HAVISHAM TO CAMILLA AS WE WERE CLOSE TO
CAMILLA THEN I WOULD HAVE STOPPED AS A MATTER OF COURSE ONLY MISS
HAVISHAM WOULDNT STOP WE SWEPT ON AND I FELT THAT I WAS HIGHLY
OBNOXIOUS TO CAMILLA

THANK YOU MISS HAVISHAM SHE RETURNED I AM AS WELL AS CAN BE
EXPECTED

WHY WHATS THE MATTER WITH YOU ASKED MISS HAVISHAM WITH EXCEEDING
SHARPNESS

NOTHING WORTH MENTIONING REPLIED CAMILLA I DONT WISH TO MAKE A
DISPLAY OF MY FEELINGS BUT I HAVE HABITUALLY THOUGHT OF YOU MORE IN
THE NIGHT THAN I AM QUITE EQUAL TO

THEN DONT THINK OF ME RETORTED MISS HAVISHAM

VERY EASILY SAID REMARKED CAMILLA AMIABLY REPRESSING A SOB WHILE A
HITCH CAME INTO HER UPPER LIP AND HER TEARS OVERFLOWED RAYMOND IS A
WITNESS WHAT GINGER AND SAL VOLATILE I AM OBLIGED TO TAKE IN THE NIGHT
RAYMOND IS A WITNESS WHAT NERVOUS JERKINGS I HAVE IN MY LEGS CHOKINGS
AND NERVOUS JERKINGS HOWEVER ARE NOTHING NEW TO ME WHEN I THINK WITH
ANXIETY OF THOSE I LOVE IF I COULD BE LESS AFFECTIONATE AND SENSITIVE
I SHOULD HAVE A BETTER DIGESTION AND AN IRON SET OF NERVES I AM SURE I
WISH IT COULD BE SO BUT AS TO NOT THINKING OF YOU IN THE NIGHTTHE
IDEA HERE A BURST OF TEARS

THE RAYMOND REFERRED TO I UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE GENTLEMAN PRESENT AND
HIM I UNDERSTOOD TO BE MR CAMILLA HE CAME TO THE RESCUE AT THIS
POINT AND SAID IN A CONSOLATORY AND COMPLIMENTARY VOICE CAMILLA MY
DEAR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT YOUR FAMILY FEELINGS ARE GRADUALLY
UNDERMINING YOU TO THE EXTENT OF MAKING ONE OF YOUR LEGS SHORTER THAN
THE OTHER

I AM NOT AWARE OBSERVED THE GRAVE LADY WHOSE VOICE I HAD HEARD BUT
ONCE THAT TO THINK OF ANY PERSON IS TO MAKE A GREAT CLAIM UPON THAT
PERSON MY DEAR

MISS SARAH POCKET WHOM I NOW SAW TO BE A LITTLE DRY BROWN CORRUGATED
OLD WOMAN WITH A SMALL FACE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE OF
WALNUTSHELLS AND A LARGE MOUTH LIKE A CATS WITHOUT THE WHISKERS
SUPPORTED THIS POSITION BY SAYING NO INDEED MY DEAR HEM

THINKING IS EASY ENOUGH SAID THE GRAVE LADY

WHAT IS EASIER YOU KNOW ASSENTED MISS SARAH POCKET

OH YES YES CRIED CAMILLA WHOSE FERMENTING FEELINGS APPEARED TO
RISE FROM HER LEGS TO HER BOSOM ITS ALL VERY TRUE ITS A WEAKNESS
TO BE SO AFFECTIONATE BUT I CANT HELP IT NO DOUBT MY HEALTH WOULD BE
MUCH BETTER IF IT WAS OTHERWISE STILL I WOULDNT CHANGE MY DISPOSITION
IF I COULD ITS THE CAUSE OF MUCH SUFFERING BUT ITS A CONSOLATION TO
KNOW I POSSES IT WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT HERE ANOTHER BURST OF
FEELING

MISS HAVISHAM AND I HAD NEVER STOPPED ALL THIS TIME BUT KEPT GOING
ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM NOW BRUSHING AGAINST THE SKIRTS OF THE
VISITORS NOW GIVING THEM THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE DISMAL CHAMBER

THERES MATTHEW SAID CAMILLA NEVER MIXING WITH ANY NATURAL TIES
NEVER COMING HERE TO SEE HOW MISS HAVISHAM IS I HAVE TAKEN TO THE SOFA
WITH MY STAYLACE CUT AND HAVE LAIN THERE HOURS INSENSIBLE WITH MY
HEAD OVER THE SIDE AND MY HAIR ALL DOWN AND MY FEET I DONT KNOW
WHERE

MUCH HIGHER THAN YOUR HEAD MY LOVE SAID MR CAMILLA

I HAVE GONE OFF INTO THAT STATE HOURS AND HOURS ON ACCOUNT OF
MATTHEWS STRANGE AND INEXPLICABLE CONDUCT AND NOBODY HAS THANKED ME

REALLY I MUST SAY I SHOULD THINK NOT INTERPOSED THE GRAVE LADY

YOU SEE MY DEAR ADDED MISS SARAH POCKET A BLANDLY VICIOUS
PERSONAGE THE QUESTION TO PUT TO YOURSELF IS WHO DID YOU EXPECT TO
THANK YOU MY LOVE

WITHOUT EXPECTING ANY THANKS OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT RESUMED
CAMILLA I HAVE REMAINED IN THAT STATE HOURS AND HOURS AND RAYMOND
IS A WITNESS OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH I HAVE CHOKED AND WHAT THE TOTAL
INEFFICACY OF GINGER HAS BEEN AND I HAVE BEEN HEARD AT THE PIANOFORTE
TUNERS ACROSS THE STREET WHERE THE POOR MISTAKEN CHILDREN HAVE EVEN
SUPPOSED IT TO BE PIGEONS COOING AT A DISTANCEAND NOW TO BE TOLD
HERE CAMILLA PUT HER HAND TO HER THROAT AND BEGAN TO BE QUITE CHEMICAL
AS TO THE FORMATION OF NEW COMBINATIONS THERE

WHEN THIS SAME MATTHEW WAS MENTIONED MISS HAVISHAM STOPPED ME AND
HERSELF AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE SPEAKER THIS CHANGE HAD A GREAT
INFLUENCE IN BRINGING CAMILLAS CHEMISTRY TO A SUDDEN END

MATTHEW WILL COME AND SEE ME AT LAST SAID MISS HAVISHAM STERNLY
WHEN I AM LAID ON THAT TABLE THAT WILL BE HIS PLACETHERE STRIKING
THE TABLE WITH HER STICK AT MY HEAD AND YOURS WILL BE THERE AND
YOUR HUSBANDS THERE AND SARAH POCKETS THERE AND GEORGIANAS THERE
NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHERE TO TAKE YOUR STATIONS WHEN YOU COME TO FEAST
UPON ME AND NOW GO

AT THE MENTION OF EACH NAME SHE HAD STRUCK THE TABLE WITH HER STICK IN
A NEW PLACE SHE NOW SAID WALK ME WALK ME AND WE WENT ON AGAIN

I SUPPOSE THERES NOTHING TO BE DONE EXCLAIMED CAMILLA BUT COMPLY
AND DEPART ITS SOMETHING TO HAVE SEEN THE OBJECT OF ONES LOVE AND
DUTY FOR EVEN SO SHORT A TIME I SHALL THINK OF IT WITH A MELANCHOLY
SATISFACTION WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT I WISH MATTHEW COULD HAVE
THAT COMFORT BUT HE SETS IT AT DEFIANCE I AM DETERMINED NOT TO MAKE A
DISPLAY OF MY FEELINGS BUT ITS VERY HARD TO BE TOLD ONE WANTS TO
FEAST ON ONES RELATIONSAS IF ONE WAS A GIANTAND TO BE TOLD TO GO
THE BARE IDEA

MR CAMILLA INTERPOSING AS MRS CAMILLA LAID HER HAND UPON HER HEAVING
BOSOM THAT LADY ASSUMED AN UNNATURAL FORTITUDE OF MANNER WHICH I
SUPPOSED TO BE EXPRESSIVE OF AN INTENTION TO DROP AND CHOKE WHEN OUT OF
VIEW AND KISSING HER HAND TO MISS HAVISHAM WAS ESCORTED FORTH SARAH
POCKET AND GEORGIANA CONTENDED WHO SHOULD REMAIN LAST BUT SARAH WAS
TOO KNOWING TO BE OUTDONE AND AMBLED ROUND GEORGIANA WITH THAT ARTFUL
SLIPPERINESS THAT THE LATTER WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE PRECEDENCE SARAH
POCKET THEN MADE HER SEPARATE EFFECT OF DEPARTING WITH BLESS YOU
MISS HAVISHAM DEAR AND WITH A SMILE OF FORGIVING PITY ON HER
WALNUTSHELL COUNTENANCE FOR THE WEAKNESSES OF THE REST

WHILE ESTELLA WAS AWAY LIGHTING THEM DOWN MISS HAVISHAM STILL WALKED
WITH HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER BUT MORE AND MORE SLOWLY AT LAST SHE
STOPPED BEFORE THE FIRE AND SAID AFTER MUTTERING AND LOOKING AT IT
SOME SECONDS

THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY PIP

I WAS GOING TO WISH HER MANY HAPPY RETURNS WHEN SHE LIFTED HER STICK

I DONT SUFFER IT TO BE SPOKEN OF I DONT SUFFER THOSE WHO WERE HERE
JUST NOW OR ANY ONE TO SPEAK OF IT THEY COME HERE ON THE DAY BUT
THEY DARE NOT REFER TO IT

OF COURSE I MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO REFER TO IT

ON THIS DAY OF THE YEAR LONG BEFORE YOU WERE BORN THIS HEAP OF
DECAY STABBING WITH HER CRUTCHED STICK AT THE PILE OF COBWEBS ON THE
TABLE BUT NOT TOUCHING IT WAS BROUGHT HERE IT AND I HAVE WORN AWAY
TOGETHER THE MICE HAVE GNAWED AT IT AND SHARPER TEETH THAN TEETH OF
MICE HAVE GNAWED AT ME

SHE HELD THE HEAD OF HER STICK AGAINST HER HEART AS SHE STOOD LOOKING
AT THE TABLE SHE IN HER ONCE WHITE DRESS ALL YELLOW AND WITHERED THE
ONCE WHITE CLOTH ALL YELLOW AND WITHERED EVERYTHING AROUND IN A STATE
TO CRUMBLE UNDER A TOUCH

WHEN THE RUIN IS COMPLETE SAID SHE WITH A GHASTLY LOOK AND WHEN
THEY LAY ME DEAD IN MY BRIDES DRESS ON THE BRIDES TABLEWHICH SHALL
BE DONE AND WHICH WILL BE THE FINISHED CURSE UPON HIMSO MUCH THE
BETTER IF IT IS DONE ON THIS DAY

SHE STOOD LOOKING AT THE TABLE AS IF SHE STOOD LOOKING AT HER OWN
FIGURE LYING THERE I REMAINED QUIET ESTELLA RETURNED AND SHE TOO
REMAINED QUIET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WE CONTINUED THUS FOR A LONG TIME
IN THE HEAVY AIR OF THE ROOM AND THE HEAVY DARKNESS THAT BROODED IN
ITS REMOTER CORNERS I EVEN HAD AN ALARMING FANCY THAT ESTELLA AND I
MIGHT PRESENTLY BEGIN TO DECAY

AT LENGTH NOT COMING OUT OF HER DISTRAUGHT STATE BY DEGREES BUT IN AN
INSTANT MISS HAVISHAM SAID LET ME SEE YOU TWO PLAY CARDS WHY HAVE
YOU NOT BEGUN WITH THAT WE RETURNED TO HER ROOM AND SAT DOWN AS
BEFORE I WAS BEGGARED AS BEFORE AND AGAIN AS BEFORE MISS HAVISHAM
WATCHED US ALL THE TIME DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TO ESTELLAS BEAUTY AND
MADE ME NOTICE IT THE MORE BY TRYING HER JEWELS ON ESTELLAS BREAST AND
HAIR

ESTELLA FOR HER PART LIKEWISE TREATED ME AS BEFORE EXCEPT THAT SHE
DID NOT CONDESCEND TO SPEAK WHEN WE HAD PLAYED SOME HALFDOZEN GAMES
A DAY WAS APPOINTED FOR MY RETURN AND I WAS TAKEN DOWN INTO THE YARD
TO BE FED IN THE FORMER DOGLIKE MANNER THERE TOO I WAS AGAIN LEFT
TO WANDER ABOUT AS I LIKED

IT IS NOT MUCH TO THE PURPOSE WHETHER A GATE IN THAT GARDEN WALL WHICH
I HAD SCRAMBLED UP TO PEEP OVER ON THE LAST OCCASION WAS ON THAT LAST
OCCASION OPEN OR SHUT ENOUGH THAT I SAW NO GATE THEN AND THAT I SAW
ONE NOW AS IT STOOD OPEN AND AS I KNEW THAT ESTELLA HAD LET THE
VISITORS OUTFOR SHE HAD RETURNED WITH THE KEYS IN HER HANDI
STROLLED INTO THE GARDEN AND STROLLED ALL OVER IT IT WAS QUITE A
WILDERNESS AND THERE WERE OLD MELONFRAMES AND CUCUMBERFRAMES IN IT
WHICH SEEMED IN THEIR DECLINE TO HAVE PRODUCED A SPONTANEOUS GROWTH OF
WEAK ATTEMPTS AT PIECES OF OLD HATS AND BOOTS WITH NOW AND THEN A
WEEDY OFFSHOOT INTO THE LIKENESS OF A BATTERED SAUCEPAN

WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THE GARDEN AND A GREENHOUSE WITH NOTHING IN IT BUT
A FALLENDOWN GRAPEVINE AND SOME BOTTLES I FOUND MYSELF IN THE DISMAL
CORNER UPON WHICH I HAD LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW NEVER QUESTIONING FOR
A MOMENT THAT THE HOUSE WAS NOW EMPTY I LOOKED IN AT ANOTHER WINDOW
AND FOUND MYSELF TO MY GREAT SURPRISE EXCHANGING A BROAD STARE WITH A
PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WITH RED EYELIDS AND LIGHT HAIR

THIS PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN QUICKLY DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED BESIDE
ME HE HAD BEEN AT HIS BOOKS WHEN I HAD FOUND MYSELF STARING AT HIM
AND I NOW SAW THAT HE WAS INKY

HALLOA SAID HE YOUNG FELLOW

HALLOA BEING A GENERAL OBSERVATION WHICH I HAD USUALLY OBSERVED TO BE
BEST ANSWERED BY ITSELF I SAID HALLOA POLITELY OMITTING YOUNG
FELLOW

WHO LET YOU IN SAID HE

MISS ESTELLA

WHO GAVE YOU LEAVE TO PROWL ABOUT

MISS ESTELLA

COME AND FIGHT SAID THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN

WHAT COULD I DO BUT FOLLOW HIM I HAVE OFTEN ASKED MYSELF THE QUESTION
SINCE BUT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HIS MANNER WAS SO FINAL AND I WAS SO
ASTONISHED THAT I FOLLOWED WHERE HE LED AS IF I HAD BEEN UNDER A
SPELL

STOP A MINUTE THOUGH HE SAID WHEELING ROUND BEFORE WE HAD GONE
MANY PACES I OUGHT TO GIVE YOU A REASON FOR FIGHTING TOO THERE IT
IS IN A MOST IRRITATING MANNER HE INSTANTLY SLAPPED HIS HANDS AGAINST
ONE ANOTHER DAINTILY FLUNG ONE OF HIS LEGS UP BEHIND HIM PULLED MY
HAIR SLAPPED HIS HANDS AGAIN DIPPED HIS HEAD AND BUTTED IT INTO MY
STOMACH

THE BULLLIKE PROCEEDING LAST MENTIONED BESIDES THAT IT WAS
UNQUESTIONABLY TO BE REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A LIBERTY WAS
PARTICULARLY DISAGREEABLE JUST AFTER BREAD AND MEAT I THEREFORE HIT
OUT AT HIM AND WAS GOING TO HIT OUT AGAIN WHEN HE SAID AHA WOULD
YOU AND BEGAN DANCING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN A MANNER QUITE
UNPARALLELED WITHIN MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE

LAWS OF THE GAME SAID HE HERE HE SKIPPED FROM HIS LEFT LEG ON TO
HIS RIGHT REGULAR RULES HERE HE SKIPPED FROM HIS RIGHT LEG ON TO
HIS LEFT COME TO THE GROUND AND GO THROUGH THE PRELIMINARIES HERE
HE DODGED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND DID ALL SORTS OF THINGS WHILE I
LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT HIM

I WAS SECRETLY AFRAID OF HIM WHEN I SAW HIM SO DEXTEROUS BUT I FELT
MORALLY AND PHYSICALLY CONVINCED THAT HIS LIGHT HEAD OF HAIR COULD HAVE
HAD NO BUSINESS IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH AND THAT I HAD A RIGHT TO
CONSIDER IT IRRELEVANT WHEN SO OBTRUDED ON MY ATTENTION THEREFORE I
FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT A WORD TO A RETIRED NOOK OF THE GARDEN FORMED BY
THE JUNCTION OF TWO WALLS AND SCREENED BY SOME RUBBISH ON HIS ASKING
ME IF I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE GROUND AND ON MY REPLYING YES HE
BEGGED MY LEAVE TO ABSENT HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT AND QUICKLY RETURNED
WITH A BOTTLE OF WATER AND A SPONGE DIPPED IN VINEGAR AVAILABLE FOR
BOTH HE SAID PLACING THESE AGAINST THE WALL AND THEN FELL TO
PULLING OFF NOT ONLY HIS JACKET AND WAISTCOAT BUT HIS SHIRT TOO IN A
MANNER AT ONCE LIGHTHEARTED BUSINESSLIKE AND BLOODTHIRSTY

ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT LOOK VERY HEALTHYHAVING PIMPLES ON HIS FACE AND
A BREAKING OUT AT HIS MOUTHTHESE DREADFUL PREPARATIONS QUITE APPALLED
ME I JUDGED HIM TO BE ABOUT MY OWN AGE BUT HE WAS MUCH TALLER AND HE
HAD A WAY OF SPINNING HIMSELF ABOUT THAT WAS FULL OF APPEARANCE FOR
THE REST HE WAS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN A GREY SUIT WHEN NOT DENUDED FOR
BATTLE WITH HIS ELBOWS KNEES WRISTS AND HEELS CONSIDERABLY IN
ADVANCE OF THE REST OF HIM AS TO DEVELOPMENT

MY HEART FAILED ME WHEN I SAW HIM SQUARING AT ME WITH EVERY
DEMONSTRATION OF MECHANICAL NICETY AND EYEING MY ANATOMY AS IF HE WERE
MINUTELY CHOOSING HIS BONE I NEVER HAVE BEEN SO SURPRISED IN MY LIFE
AS I WAS WHEN I LET OUT THE FIRST BLOW AND SAW HIM LYING ON HIS BACK
LOOKING UP AT ME WITH A BLOODY NOSE AND HIS FACE EXCEEDINGLY
FORESHORTENED

BUT HE WAS ON HIS FEET DIRECTLY AND AFTER SPONGING HIMSELF WITH A
GREAT SHOW OF DEXTERITY BEGAN SQUARING AGAIN THE SECOND GREATEST
SURPRISE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE WAS SEEING HIM ON HIS BACK AGAIN
LOOKING UP AT ME OUT OF A BLACK EYE

HIS SPIRIT INSPIRED ME WITH GREAT RESPECT HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO
STRENGTH AND HE NEVER ONCE HIT ME HARD AND HE WAS ALWAYS KNOCKED
DOWN BUT HE WOULD BE UP AGAIN IN A MOMENT SPONGING HIMSELF OR
DRINKING OUT OF THE WATERBOTTLE WITH THE GREATEST SATISFACTION IN
SECONDING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO FORM AND THEN CAME AT ME WITH AN AIR
AND A SHOW THAT MADE ME BELIEVE HE REALLY WAS GOING TO DO FOR ME AT
LAST HE GOT HEAVILY BRUISED FOR I AM SORRY TO RECORD THAT THE MORE I
HIT HIM THE HARDER I HIT HIM BUT HE CAME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND
AGAIN UNTIL AT LAST HE GOT A BAD FALL WITH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
AGAINST THE WALL EVEN AFTER THAT CRISIS IN OUR AFFAIRS HE GOT UP AND
TURNED ROUND AND ROUND CONFUSEDLY A FEW TIMES NOT KNOWING WHERE I WAS
BUT FINALLY WENT ON HIS KNEES TO HIS SPONGE AND THREW IT UP AT THE
SAME TIME PANTING OUT THAT MEANS YOU HAVE WON

HE SEEMED SO BRAVE AND INNOCENT THAT ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT PROPOSED THE
CONTEST I FELT BUT A GLOOMY SATISFACTION IN MY VICTORY INDEED I GO
SO FAR AS TO HOPE THAT I REGARDED MYSELF WHILE DRESSING AS A SPECIES OF
SAVAGE YOUNG WOLF OR OTHER WILD BEAST HOWEVER I GOT DRESSED DARKLY
WIPING MY SANGUINARY FACE AT INTERVALS AND I SAID CAN I HELP YOU
AND HE SAID NO THANKEE AND I SAID GOOD AFTERNOON AND HE SAID
SAME TO YOU

WHEN I GOT INTO THE COURTYARD I FOUND ESTELLA WAITING WITH THE KEYS
BUT SHE NEITHER ASKED ME WHERE I HAD BEEN NOR WHY I HAD KEPT HER
WAITING AND THERE WAS A BRIGHT FLUSH UPON HER FACE AS THOUGH
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO DELIGHT HER INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO THE
GATE TOO SHE STEPPED BACK INTO THE PASSAGE AND BECKONED ME

COME HERE YOU MAY KISS ME IF YOU LIKE

I KISSED HER CHEEK AS SHE TURNED IT TO ME I THINK I WOULD HAVE GONE
THROUGH A GREAT DEAL TO KISS HER CHEEK BUT I FELT THAT THE KISS WAS
GIVEN TO THE COARSE COMMON BOY AS A PIECE OF MONEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND
THAT IT WAS WORTH NOTHING

WHAT WITH THE BIRTHDAY VISITORS AND WHAT WITH THE CARDS AND WHAT WITH
THE FIGHT MY STAY HAD LASTED SO LONG THAT WHEN I NEARED HOME THE
LIGHT ON THE SPIT OF SAND OFF THE POINT ON THE MARSHES WAS GLEAMING
AGAINST A BLACK NIGHTSKY AND JOES FURNACE WAS FLINGING A PATH OF
FIRE ACROSS THE ROAD




CHAPTER XII


MY MIND GREW VERY UNEASY ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN
THE MORE I THOUGHT OF THE FIGHT AND RECALLED THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN
ON HIS BACK IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PUFFY AND INCRIMSONED COUNTENANCE THE
MORE CERTAIN IT APPEARED THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE DONE TO ME I FELT
THAT THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMANS BLOOD WAS ON MY HEAD AND THAT THE LAW
WOULD AVENGE IT WITHOUT HAVING ANY DEFINITE IDEA OF THE PENALTIES I
HAD INCURRED IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT VILLAGE BOYS COULD NOT GO
STALKING ABOUT THE COUNTRY RAVAGING THE HOUSES OF GENTLEFOLKS AND
PITCHING INTO THE STUDIOUS YOUTH OF ENGLAND WITHOUT LAYING THEMSELVES
OPEN TO SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR SOME DAYS I EVEN KEPT CLOSE AT HOME
AND LOOKED OUT AT THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION AND
TREPIDATION BEFORE GOING ON AN ERRAND LEST THE OFFICERS OF THE COUNTY
JAIL SHOULD POUNCE UPON ME THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMANS NOSE HAD STAINED
MY TROUSERS AND I TRIED TO WASH OUT THAT EVIDENCE OF MY GUILT IN THE
DEAD OF NIGHT I HAD CUT MY KNUCKLES AGAINST THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMANS
TEETH AND I TWISTED MY IMAGINATION INTO A THOUSAND TANGLES AS I
DEVISED INCREDIBLE WAYS OF ACCOUNTING FOR THAT DAMNATORY CIRCUMSTANCE
WHEN I SHOULD BE HALED BEFORE THE JUDGES

WHEN THE DAY CAME ROUND FOR MY RETURN TO THE SCENE OF THE DEED OF
VIOLENCE MY TERRORS REACHED THEIR HEIGHT WHETHER MYRMIDONS OF
JUSTICE ESPECIALLY SENT DOWN FROM LONDON WOULD BE LYING IN AMBUSH
BEHIND THE GATEWHETHER MISS HAVISHAM PREFERRING TO TAKE PERSONAL
VENGEANCE FOR AN OUTRAGE DONE TO HER HOUSE MIGHT RISE IN THOSE
GRAVECLOTHES OF HERS DRAW A PISTOL AND SHOOT ME DEADWHETHER
SUBORNED BOYSA NUMEROUS BAND OF MERCENARIESMIGHT BE ENGAGED TO FALL
UPON ME IN THE BREWERY AND CUFF ME UNTIL I WAS NO MOREIT WAS HIGH
TESTIMONY TO MY CONFIDENCE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN
THAT I NEVER IMAGINED HIM ACCESSORY TO THESE RETALIATIONS THEY
ALWAYS CAME INTO MY MIND AS THE ACTS OF INJUDICIOUS RELATIVES OF HIS
GOADED ON BY THE STATE OF HIS VISAGE AND AN INDIGNANT SYMPATHY WITH THE
FAMILY FEATURES

HOWEVER GO TO MISS HAVISHAMS I MUST AND GO I DID AND BEHOLD
NOTHING CAME OF THE LATE STRUGGLE IT WAS NOT ALLUDED TO IN ANY WAY
AND NO PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS TO BE DISCOVERED ON THE PREMISES I
FOUND THE SAME GATE OPEN AND I EXPLORED THE GARDEN AND EVEN LOOKED IN
AT THE WINDOWS OF THE DETACHED HOUSE BUT MY VIEW WAS SUDDENLY STOPPED
BY THE CLOSED SHUTTERS WITHIN AND ALL WAS LIFELESS ONLY IN THE CORNER
WHERE THE COMBAT HAD TAKEN PLACE COULD I DETECT ANY EVIDENCE OF THE
YOUNG GENTLEMANS EXISTENCE THERE WERE TRACES OF HIS GORE IN THAT
SPOT AND I COVERED THEM WITH GARDENMOULD FROM THE EYE OF MAN

ON THE BROAD LANDING BETWEEN MISS HAVISHAMS OWN ROOM AND THAT OTHER
ROOM IN WHICH THE LONG TABLE WAS LAID OUT I SAW A GARDENCHAIRA
LIGHT CHAIR ON WHEELS THAT YOU PUSHED FROM BEHIND IT HAD BEEN PLACED
THERE SINCE MY LAST VISIT AND I ENTERED THAT SAME DAY ON A REGULAR
OCCUPATION OF PUSHING MISS HAVISHAM IN THIS CHAIR WHEN SHE WAS TIRED
OF WALKING WITH HER HAND UPON MY SHOULDER ROUND HER OWN ROOM AND
ACROSS THE LANDING AND ROUND THE OTHER ROOM OVER AND OVER AND OVER
AGAIN WE WOULD MAKE THESE JOURNEYS AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD LAST AS
LONG AS THREE HOURS AT A STRETCH I INSENSIBLY FALL INTO A GENERAL
MENTION OF THESE JOURNEYS AS NUMEROUS BECAUSE IT WAS AT ONCE SETTLED
THAT I SHOULD RETURN EVERY ALTERNATE DAY AT NOON FOR THESE PURPOSES
AND BECAUSE I AM NOW GOING TO SUM UP A PERIOD OF AT LEAST EIGHT OR TEN
MONTHS

AS WE BEGAN TO BE MORE USED TO ONE ANOTHER MISS HAVISHAM TALKED MORE
TO ME AND ASKED ME SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHAT HAD I LEARNT AND WHAT WAS I
GOING TO BE I TOLD HER I WAS GOING TO BE APPRENTICED TO JOE I
BELIEVED AND I ENLARGED UPON MY KNOWING NOTHING AND WANTING TO KNOW
EVERYTHING IN THE HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT OFFER SOME HELP TOWARDS THAT
DESIRABLE END BUT SHE DID NOT ON THE CONTRARY SHE SEEMED TO PREFER
MY BEING IGNORANT NEITHER DID SHE EVER GIVE ME ANY MONEYOR ANYTHING
BUT MY DAILY DINNERNOR EVER STIPULATE THAT I SHOULD BE PAID FOR MY
SERVICES

ESTELLA WAS ALWAYS ABOUT AND ALWAYS LET ME IN AND OUT BUT NEVER TOLD
ME I MIGHT KISS HER AGAIN SOMETIMES SHE WOULD COLDLY TOLERATE ME
SOMETIMES SHE WOULD CONDESCEND TO ME SOMETIMES SHE WOULD BE QUITE
FAMILIAR WITH ME SOMETIMES SHE WOULD TELL ME ENERGETICALLY THAT SHE
HATED ME MISS HAVISHAM WOULD OFTEN ASK ME IN A WHISPER OR WHEN WE
WERE ALONE DOES SHE GROW PRETTIER AND PRETTIER PIP AND WHEN I SAID
YES FOR INDEED SHE DID WOULD SEEM TO ENJOY IT GREEDILY ALSO WHEN
WE PLAYED AT CARDS MISS HAVISHAM WOULD LOOK ON WITH A MISERLY RELISH
OF ESTELLAS MOODS WHATEVER THEY WERE AND SOMETIMES WHEN HER MOODS
WERE SO MANY AND SO CONTRADICTORY OF ONE ANOTHER THAT I WAS PUZZLED
WHAT TO SAY OR DO MISS HAVISHAM WOULD EMBRACE HER WITH LAVISH
FONDNESS MURMURING SOMETHING IN HER EAR THAT SOUNDED LIKE BREAK THEIR
HEARTS MY PRIDE AND HOPE BREAK THEIR HEARTS AND HAVE NO MERCY

THERE WAS A SONG JOE USED TO HUM FRAGMENTS OF AT THE FORGE OF WHICH
THE BURDEN WAS OLD CLEM THIS WAS NOT A VERY CEREMONIOUS WAY OF
RENDERING HOMAGE TO A PATRON SAINT BUT I BELIEVE OLD CLEM STOOD IN
THAT RELATION TOWARDS SMITHS IT WAS A SONG THAT IMITATED THE MEASURE
OF BEATING UPON IRON AND WAS A MERE LYRICAL EXCUSE FOR THE
INTRODUCTION OF OLD CLEMS RESPECTED NAME THUS YOU WERE TO HAMMER
BOYS ROUNDOLD CLEM WITH A THUMP AND A SOUNDOLD CLEM BEAT IT OUT
BEAT IT OUTOLD CLEM WITH A CLINK FOR THE STOUTOLD CLEM BLOW THE
FIRE BLOW THE FIREOLD CLEM ROARING DRYER SOARING HIGHEROLD CLEM
ONE DAY SOON AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHAIR MISS HAVISHAM SUDDENLY
SAYING TO ME WITH THE IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER FINGERS THERE
THERE THERE SING I WAS SURPRISED INTO CROONING THIS DITTY AS I
PUSHED HER OVER THE FLOOR IT HAPPENED SO TO CATCH HER FANCY THAT SHE
TOOK IT UP IN A LOW BROODING VOICE AS IF SHE WERE SINGING IN HER SLEEP
AFTER THAT IT BECAME CUSTOMARY WITH US TO HAVE IT AS WE MOVED ABOUT
AND ESTELLA WOULD OFTEN JOIN IN THOUGH THE WHOLE STRAIN WAS SO
SUBDUED EVEN WHEN THERE WERE THREE OF US THAT IT MADE LESS NOISE IN
THE GRIM OLD HOUSE THAN THE LIGHTEST BREATH OF WIND

WHAT COULD I BECOME WITH THESE SURROUNDINGS HOW COULD MY CHARACTER
FAIL TO BE INFLUENCED BY THEM IS IT TO BE WONDERED AT IF MY THOUGHTS
WERE DAZED AS MY EYES WERE WHEN I CAME OUT INTO THE NATURAL LIGHT
FROM THE MISTY YELLOW ROOMS

PERHAPS I MIGHT HAVE TOLD JOE ABOUT THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IF I HAD
NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN BETRAYED INTO THOSE ENORMOUS INVENTIONS TO WHICH I
HAD CONFESSED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I FELT THAT JOE COULD HARDLY
FAIL TO DISCERN IN THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN AN APPROPRIATE PASSENGER
TO BE PUT INTO THE BLACK VELVET COACH THEREFORE I SAID NOTHING OF
HIM BESIDES THAT SHRINKING FROM HAVING MISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA
DISCUSSED WHICH HAD COME UPON ME IN THE BEGINNING GREW MUCH MORE
POTENT AS TIME WENT ON I REPOSED COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN NO ONE BUT
BIDDY BUT I TOLD POOR BIDDY EVERYTHING WHY IT CAME NATURAL TO ME TO
DO SO AND WHY BIDDY HAD A DEEP CONCERN IN EVERYTHING I TOLD HER I DID
NOT KNOW THEN THOUGH I THINK I KNOW NOW

MEANWHILE COUNCILS WENT ON IN THE KITCHEN AT HOME FRAUGHT WITH ALMOST
INSUPPORTABLE AGGRAVATION TO MY EXASPERATED SPIRIT THAT ASS
PUMBLECHOOK USED OFTEN TO COME OVER OF A NIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF
DISCUSSING MY PROSPECTS WITH MY SISTER AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE TO
THIS HOUR WITH LESS PENITENCE THAN I OUGHT TO FEEL THAT IF THESE
HANDS COULD HAVE TAKEN A LINCHPIN OUT OF HIS CHAISECART THEY WOULD
HAVE DONE IT THE MISERABLE MAN WAS A MAN OF THAT CONFINED STOLIDITY OF
MIND THAT HE COULD NOT DISCUSS MY PROSPECTS WITHOUT HAVING ME BEFORE
HIMAS IT WERE TO OPERATE UPONAND HE WOULD DRAG ME UP FROM MY STOOL
USUALLY BY THE COLLAR WHERE I WAS QUIET IN A CORNER AND PUTTING ME
BEFORE THE FIRE AS IF I WERE GOING TO BE COOKED WOULD BEGIN BY SAYING
NOW MUM HERE IS THIS BOY HERE IS THIS BOY WHICH YOU BROUGHT UP BY
HAND HOLD UP YOUR HEAD BOY AND BE FOREVER GRATEFUL UNTO THEM WHICH
SO DID DO NOW MUM WITH RESPECTIONS TO THIS BOY AND THEN HE WOULD
RUMPLE MY HAIR THE WRONG WAYWHICH FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE AS
ALREADY HINTED I HAVE IN MY SOUL DENIED THE RIGHT OF ANY
FELLOWCREATURE TO DOAND WOULD HOLD ME BEFORE HIM BY THE SLEEVEA
SPECTACLE OF IMBECILITY ONLY TO BE EQUALLED BY HIMSELF

THEN HE AND MY SISTER WOULD PAIR OFF IN SUCH NONSENSICAL SPECULATIONS
ABOUT MISS HAVISHAM AND ABOUT WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITH ME AND FOR ME
THAT I USED TO WANTQUITE PAINFULLYTO BURST INTO SPITEFUL TEARS FLY
AT PUMBLECHOOK AND PUMMEL HIM ALL OVER IN THESE DIALOGUES MY SISTER
SPOKE TO ME AS IF SHE WERE MORALLY WRENCHING ONE OF MY TEETH OUT AT
EVERY REFERENCE WHILE PUMBLECHOOK HIMSELF SELFCONSTITUTED MY PATRON
WOULD SIT SUPERVISING ME WITH A DEPRECIATORY EYE LIKE THE ARCHITECT OF
MY FORTUNES WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF ENGAGED ON A VERY UNREMUNERATIVE JOB

IN THESE DISCUSSIONS JOE BORE NO PART BUT HE WAS OFTEN TALKED AT
WHILE THEY WERE IN PROGRESS BY REASON OF MRS JOES PERCEIVING THAT HE
WAS NOT FAVOURABLE TO MY BEING TAKEN FROM THE FORGE I WAS FULLY OLD
ENOUGH NOW TO BE APPRENTICED TO JOE AND WHEN JOE SAT WITH THE POKER ON
HIS KNEES THOUGHTFULLY RAKING OUT THE ASHES BETWEEN THE LOWER BARS MY
SISTER WOULD SO DISTINCTLY CONSTRUE THAT INNOCENT ACTION INTO
OPPOSITION ON HIS PART THAT SHE WOULD DIVE AT HIM TAKE THE POKER OUT
OF HIS HANDS SHAKE HIM AND PUT IT AWAY THERE WAS A MOST IRRITATING
END TO EVERY ONE OF THESE DEBATES ALL IN A MOMENT WITH NOTHING TO
LEAD UP TO IT MY SISTER WOULD STOP HERSELF IN A YAWN AND CATCHING
SIGHT OF ME AS IT WERE INCIDENTALLY WOULD SWOOP UPON ME WITH COME
THERES ENOUGH OF YOU YOU GET ALONG TO BED YOUVE GIVEN TROUBLE
ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT I HOPE AS IF I HAD BESOUGHT THEM AS A FAVOUR TO
BOTHER MY LIFE OUT

WE WENT ON IN THIS WAY FOR A LONG TIME AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT WE
SHOULD CONTINUE TO GO ON IN THIS WAY FOR A LONG TIME WHEN ONE DAY MISS
HAVISHAM STOPPED SHORT AS SHE AND I WERE WALKING SHE LEANING ON MY
SHOULDER AND SAID WITH SOME DISPLEASURE

YOU ARE GROWING TALL PIP

I THOUGHT IT BEST TO HINT THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A MEDITATIVE LOOK
THAT THIS MIGHT BE OCCASIONED BY CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAD NO
CONTROL

SHE SAID NO MORE AT THE TIME BUT SHE PRESENTLY STOPPED AND LOOKED AT
ME AGAIN AND PRESENTLY AGAIN AND AFTER THAT LOOKED FROWNING AND
MOODY ON THE NEXT DAY OF MY ATTENDANCE WHEN OUR USUAL EXERCISE WAS
OVER AND I HAD LANDED HER AT HER DRESSINGTABLE SHE STAYED ME WITH A
MOVEMENT OF HER IMPATIENT FINGERS

TELL ME THE NAME AGAIN OF THAT BLACKSMITH OF YOURS

JOE GARGERY MAAM

MEANING THE MASTER YOU WERE TO BE APPRENTICED TO

YES MISS HAVISHAM

YOU HAD BETTER BE APPRENTICED AT ONCE WOULD GARGERY COME HERE WITH
YOU AND BRING YOUR INDENTURES DO YOU THINK

I SIGNIFIED THAT I HAD NO DOUBT HE WOULD TAKE IT AS AN HONOUR TO BE
ASKED

THEN LET HIM COME

AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME MISS HAVISHAM

THERE THERE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT TIMES LET HIM COME SOON AND COME
ALONG WITH YOU

WHEN I GOT HOME AT NIGHT AND DELIVERED THIS MESSAGE FOR JOE MY SISTER
WENT ON THE RAMPAGE IN A MORE ALARMING DEGREE THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS
PERIOD SHE ASKED ME AND JOE WHETHER WE SUPPOSED SHE WAS DOORMATS
UNDER OUR FEET AND HOW WE DARED TO USE HER SO AND WHAT COMPANY WE
GRACIOUSLY THOUGHT SHE WAS FIT FOR WHEN SHE HAD EXHAUSTED A TORRENT
OF SUCH INQUIRIES SHE THREW A CANDLESTICK AT JOE BURST INTO A LOUD
SOBBING GOT OUT THE DUSTPANWHICH WAS ALWAYS A VERY BAD SIGNPUT ON
HER COARSE APRON AND BEGAN CLEANING UP TO A TERRIBLE EXTENT NOT
SATISFIED WITH A DRY CLEANING SHE TOOK TO A PAIL AND SCRUBBINGBRUSH
AND CLEANED US OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME SO THAT WE STOOD SHIVERING IN THE
BACKYARD IT WAS TEN OCLOCK AT NIGHT BEFORE WE VENTURED TO CREEP IN
AGAIN AND THEN SHE ASKED JOE WHY HE HADNT MARRIED A NEGRESS SLAVE AT
ONCE JOE OFFERED NO ANSWER POOR FELLOW BUT STOOD FEELING HIS WHISKER
AND LOOKING DEJECTEDLY AT ME AS IF HE THOUGHT IT REALLY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN A BETTER SPECULATION




CHAPTER XIII


IT WAS A TRIAL TO MY FEELINGS ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE TO SEE JOE
ARRAYING HIMSELF IN HIS SUNDAY CLOTHES TO ACCOMPANY ME TO MISS
HAVISHAMS HOWEVER AS HE THOUGHT HIS COURTSUIT NECESSARY TO THE
OCCASION IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO TELL HIM THAT HE LOOKED FAR BETTER IN
HIS WORKINGDRESS THE RATHER BECAUSE I KNEW HE MADE HIMSELF SO
DREADFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE ENTIRELY ON MY ACCOUNT AND THAT IT WAS FOR
ME HE PULLED UP HIS SHIRTCOLLAR SO VERY HIGH BEHIND THAT IT MADE THE
HAIR ON THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD STAND UP LIKE A TUFT OF FEATHERS

AT BREAKFASTTIME MY SISTER DECLARED HER INTENTION OF GOING TO TOWN
WITH US AND BEING LEFT AT UNCLE PUMBLECHOOKS AND CALLED FOR WHEN WE
HAD DONE WITH OUR FINE LADIESA WAY OF PUTTING THE CASE FROM WHICH
JOE APPEARED INCLINED TO AUGUR THE WORST THE FORGE WAS SHUT UP FOR THE
DAY AND JOE INSCRIBED IN CHALK UPON THE DOOR AS IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO
DO ON THE VERY RARE OCCASIONS WHEN HE WAS NOT AT WORK THE MONOSYLLABLE
HOUT ACCOMPANIED BY A SKETCH OF AN ARROW SUPPOSED TO BE FLYING IN THE
DIRECTION HE HAD TAKEN

WE WALKED TO TOWN MY SISTER LEADING THE WAY IN A VERY LARGE BEAVER
BONNET AND CARRYING A BASKET LIKE THE GREAT SEAL OF ENGLAND IN PLAITED
STRAW A PAIR OF PATTENS A SPARE SHAWL AND AN UMBRELLA THOUGH IT WAS
A FINE BRIGHT DAY I AM NOT QUITE CLEAR WHETHER THESE ARTICLES WERE
CARRIED PENITENTIALLY OR OSTENTATIOUSLY BUT I RATHER THINK THEY WERE
DISPLAYED AS ARTICLES OF PROPERTYMUCH AS CLEOPATRA OR ANY OTHER
SOVEREIGN LADY ON THE RAMPAGE MIGHT EXHIBIT HER WEALTH IN A PAGEANT OR
PROCESSION

WHEN WE CAME TO PUMBLECHOOKS MY SISTER BOUNCED IN AND LEFT US AS IT
WAS ALMOST NOON JOE AND I HELD STRAIGHT ON TO MISS HAVISHAMS HOUSE
ESTELLA OPENED THE GATE AS USUAL AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED JOE
TOOK HIS HAT OFF AND STOOD WEIGHING IT BY THE BRIM IN BOTH HIS HANDS
AS IF HE HAD SOME URGENT REASON IN HIS MIND FOR BEING PARTICULAR TO
HALF A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE

ESTELLA TOOK NO NOTICE OF EITHER OF US BUT LED US THE WAY THAT I KNEW
SO WELL I FOLLOWED NEXT TO HER AND JOE CAME LAST WHEN I LOOKED BACK
AT JOE IN THE LONG PASSAGE HE WAS STILL WEIGHING HIS HAT WITH THE
GREATEST CARE AND WAS COMING AFTER US IN LONG STRIDES ON THE TIPS OF
HIS TOES

ESTELLA TOLD ME WE WERE BOTH TO GO IN SO I TOOK JOE BY THE COATCUFF
AND CONDUCTED HIM INTO MISS HAVISHAMS PRESENCE SHE WAS SEATED AT HER
DRESSINGTABLE AND LOOKED ROUND AT US IMMEDIATELY

OH SAID SHE TO JOE YOU ARE THE HUSBAND OF THE SISTER OF THIS BOY

I COULD HARDLY HAVE IMAGINED DEAR OLD JOE LOOKING SO UNLIKE HIMSELF OR
SO LIKE SOME EXTRAORDINARY BIRD STANDING AS HE DID SPEECHLESS WITH
HIS TUFT OF FEATHERS RUFFLED AND HIS MOUTH OPEN AS IF HE WANTED A
WORM

YOU ARE THE HUSBAND REPEATED MISS HAVISHAM OF THE SISTER OF THIS
BOY

IT WAS VERY AGGRAVATING BUT THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW JOE PERSISTED
IN ADDRESSING ME INSTEAD OF MISS HAVISHAM

WHICH I MEANTERSAY PIP JOE NOW OBSERVED IN A MANNER THAT WAS AT
ONCE EXPRESSIVE OF FORCIBLE ARGUMENTATION STRICT CONFIDENCE AND GREAT
POLITENESS AS I HUP AND MARRIED YOUR SISTER AND I WERE AT THE TIME
WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL IF YOU WAS ANYWAYS INCLINED A SINGLE MAN

WELL SAID MISS HAVISHAM AND YOU HAVE REARED THE BOY WITH THE
INTENTION OF TAKING HIM FOR YOUR APPRENTICE IS THAT SO MR GARGERY

YOU KNOW PIP REPLIED JOE AS YOU AND ME WERE EVER FRIENDS AND IT
WERE LOOKED FORARD TO BETWIXT US AS BEING CALCLATED TO LEAD TO
LARKS NOT BUT WHAT PIP IF YOU HAD EVER MADE OBJECTIONS TO THE
BUSINESSSUCH AS ITS BEING OPEN TO BLACK AND SUT OR SUCHLIKENOT
BUT WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTENDED TO DONT YOU SEE

HAS THE BOY SAID MISS HAVISHAM EVER MADE ANY OBJECTION DOES HE
LIKE THE TRADE

WHICH IT IS WELL BEKNOWN TO YOURSELF PIP RETURNED JOE
STRENGTHENING HIS FORMER MIXTURE OF ARGUMENTATION CONFIDENCE AND
POLITENESS THAT IT WERE THE WISH OF YOUR OWN HART I SAW THE IDEA
SUDDENLY BREAK UPON HIM THAT HE WOULD ADAPT HIS EPITAPH TO THE
OCCASION BEFORE HE WENT ON TO SAY AND THERE WERENT NO OBJECTION ON
YOUR PART AND PIP IT WERE THE GREAT WISH OF YOUR HART

IT WAS QUITE IN VAIN FOR ME TO ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE THAT HE
OUGHT TO SPEAK TO MISS HAVISHAM THE MORE I MADE FACES AND GESTURES TO
HIM TO DO IT THE MORE CONFIDENTIAL ARGUMENTATIVE AND POLITE HE
PERSISTED IN BEING TO ME

HAVE YOU BROUGHT HIS INDENTURES WITH YOU ASKED MISS HAVISHAM

WELL PIP YOU KNOW REPLIED JOE AS IF THAT WERE A LITTLE
UNREASONABLE YOU YOURSELF SEE ME PUT EM IN MY AT AND THEREFORE YOU
KNOW AS THEY ARE HERE WITH WHICH HE TOOK THEM OUT AND GAVE THEM NOT
TO MISS HAVISHAM BUT TO ME I AM AFRAID I WAS ASHAMED OF THE DEAR GOOD
FELLOWI KNOW I WAS ASHAMED OF HIMWHEN I SAW THAT ESTELLA STOOD AT
THE BACK OF MISS HAVISHAMS CHAIR AND THAT HER EYES LAUGHED
MISCHIEVOUSLY I TOOK THE INDENTURES OUT OF HIS HAND AND GAVE THEM TO
MISS HAVISHAM

YOU EXPECTED SAID MISS HAVISHAM AS SHE LOOKED THEM OVER NO
PREMIUM WITH THE BOY

JOE I REMONSTRATED FOR HE MADE NO REPLY AT ALL WHY DONT YOU
ANSWER

PIP RETURNED JOE CUTTING ME SHORT AS IF HE WERE HURT WHICH I
MEANTERSAY THAT WERE NOT A QUESTION REQUIRING A ANSWER BETWIXT YOURSELF
AND ME AND WHICH YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO BE FULL WELL NO YOU KNOW IT
TO BE NO PIP AND WHEREFORE SHOULD I SAY IT

MISS HAVISHAM GLANCED AT HIM AS IF SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE REALLY WAS
BETTER THAN I HAD THOUGHT POSSIBLE SEEING WHAT HE WAS THERE AND TOOK
UP A LITTLE BAG FROM THE TABLE BESIDE HER

PIP HAS EARNED A PREMIUM HERE SHE SAID AND HERE IT IS THERE ARE
FIVEANDTWENTY GUINEAS IN THIS BAG GIVE IT TO YOUR MASTER PIP

AS IF HE WERE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF HIS MIND WITH THE WONDER AWAKENED IN
HIM BY HER STRANGE FIGURE AND THE STRANGE ROOM JOE EVEN AT THIS PASS
PERSISTED IN ADDRESSING ME

THIS IS WERY LIBERAL ON YOUR PART PIP SAID JOE AND IT IS AS SUCH
RECEIVED AND GRATEFUL WELCOME THOUGH NEVER LOOKED FOR FAR NOR NEAR
NOR NOWHERES AND NOW OLD CHAP SAID JOE CONVEYING TO ME A
SENSATION FIRST OF BURNING AND THEN OF FREEZING FOR I FELT AS IF THAT
FAMILIAR EXPRESSION WERE APPLIED TO MISS HAVISHAMAND NOW OLD CHAP
MAY WE DO OUR DUTY MAY YOU AND ME DO OUR DUTY BOTH ON US BY ONE AND
ANOTHER AND BY THEM WHICH YOUR LIBERAL PRESENTHAVECONWEYEDTO BEFOR
THE SATISFACTION OF MINDOFTHEM AS NEVER HERE JOE SHOWED THAT HE
FELT HE HAD FALLEN INTO FRIGHTFUL DIFFICULTIES UNTIL HE TRIUMPHANTLY
RESCUED HIMSELF WITH THE WORDS AND FROM MYSELF FAR BE IT THESE
WORDS HAD SUCH A ROUND AND CONVINCING SOUND FOR HIM THAT HE SAID THEM
TWICE

GOODBYE PIP SAID MISS HAVISHAM LET THEM OUT ESTELLA

AM I TO COME AGAIN MISS HAVISHAM I ASKED

NO GARGERY IS YOUR MASTER NOW GARGERY ONE WORD

THUS CALLING HIM BACK AS I WENT OUT OF THE DOOR I HEARD HER SAY TO JOE
IN A DISTINCT EMPHATIC VOICE THE BOY HAS BEEN A GOOD BOY HERE AND
THAT IS HIS REWARD OF COURSE AS AN HONEST MAN YOU WILL EXPECT NO
OTHER AND NO MORE

HOW JOE GOT OUT OF THE ROOM I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE BUT I
KNOW THAT WHEN HE DID GET OUT HE WAS STEADILY PROCEEDING UPSTAIRS
INSTEAD OF COMING DOWN AND WAS DEAF TO ALL REMONSTRANCES UNTIL I WENT
AFTER HIM AND LAID HOLD OF HIM IN ANOTHER MINUTE WE WERE OUTSIDE THE
GATE AND IT WAS LOCKED AND ESTELLA WAS GONE WHEN WE STOOD IN THE
DAYLIGHT ALONE AGAIN JOE BACKED UP AGAINST A WALL AND SAID TO ME
ASTONISHING AND THERE HE REMAINED SO LONG SAYING ASTONISHING AT
INTERVALS SO OFTEN THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HIS SENSES WERE NEVER COMING
BACK AT LENGTH HE PROLONGED HIS REMARK INTO PIP I DO ASSURE YOU
THIS IS ASTONISHING AND SO BY DEGREES BECAME CONVERSATIONAL AND
ABLE TO WALK AWAY

I HAVE REASON TO THINK THAT JOES INTELLECTS WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE
ENCOUNTER THEY HAD PASSED THROUGH AND THAT ON OUR WAY TO PUMBLECHOOKS
HE INVENTED A SUBTLE AND DEEP DESIGN MY REASON IS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT
TOOK PLACE IN MR PUMBLECHOOKS PARLOUR WHERE ON OUR PRESENTING
OURSELVES MY SISTER SAT IN CONFERENCE WITH THAT DETESTED SEEDSMAN

WELL CRIED MY SISTER ADDRESSING US BOTH AT ONCE AND WHATS

REMEMBRANCE MADE IT WERY PARTICKLER THAT WE SHOULD GIVE HERWERE IT
COMPLIMENTS OR RESPECTS PIP

COMPLIMENTS I SAID

WHICH THAT WERE MY OWN BELIEF ANSWERED JOE HER COMPLIMENTS TO MRS
J GARGERY

EFFORT OF REMEMBRANCE THAT THE STATE OF MISS HAVISHAMS ELTH WERE
SITCH AS WOULD HAVEALLOWED WERE IT PIP

OF HER HAVING THE PLEASURE I ADDED

OF LADIES COMPANY SAID JOE AND DREW A LONG BREATH

WELL CRIED MY SISTER WITH A MOLLIFIED GLANCE AT MR PUMBLECHOOK
SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE POLITENESS TO SEND THAT MESSAGE AT FIRST BUT
ITS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER AND WHAT DID SHE GIVE YOUNG RANTIPOLE
HERE

SHE GIV HIM SAID JOE NOTHING

WHAT SHE GIV SAID JOE SHE GIV TO HIS FRIENDS AND BY HIS
FRIENDS WERE HER EXPLANATION I MEAN INTO THE HANDS OF HIS SISTER
MRS J GARGERY THEM WERE HER WORDS MRS J GARGERY SHE MAYNT
HAVE KNOWD ADDED JOE WITH AN APPEARANCE OF REFLECTION WHETHER IT
WERE JOE OR JORGE

MY SISTER LOOKED AT PUMBLECHOOK WHO SMOOTHED THE ELBOWS OF HIS WOODEN
ARMCHAIR AND NODDED AT HER AND AT THE FIRE AS IF HE HAD KNOWN ALL
ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND

AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT ASKED MY SISTER LAUGHING POSITIVELY
LAUGHING

WHAT WOULD PRESENT COMPANY SAY TO TEN POUND DEMANDED JOE

THEYD SAY RETURNED MY SISTER CURTLY PRETTY WELL NOT TOO MUCH
BUT PRETTY WELL

ITS MORE THAN THAT THEN SAID JOE

THAT FEARFUL IMPOSTOR PUMBLECHOOK IMMEDIATELY NODDED AND SAID AS HE
RUBBED THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR ITS MORE THAN THAT MUM

WHY YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY BEGAN MY SISTER

YES I DO MUM SAID PUMBLECHOOK BUT WAIT A BIT GO ON JOSEPH GOOD
IN YOU GO ON

WHAT WOULD PRESENT COMPANY SAY PROCEEDED JOE TO TWENTY POUND

HANDSOME WOULD BE THE WORD RETURNED MY SISTER

WELL THEN SAID JOE ITS MORE THAN TWENTY POUND

THAT ABJECT HYPOCRITE PUMBLECHOOK NODDED AGAIN AND SAID WITH A
PATRONIZING LAUGH ITS MORE THAN THAT MUM GOOD AGAIN FOLLOW HER
UP JOSEPH

THEN TO MAKE AN END OF IT SAID JOE DELIGHTEDLY HANDING THE BAG TO
MY SISTER ITS FIVEANDTWENTY POUND

ITS FIVEANDTWENTY POUND MUM ECHOED THAT BASEST OF SWINDLERS
PUMBLECHOOK RISING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HER AND ITS NO MORE THAN
YOUR MERITS AS I SAID WHEN MY OPINION WAS ASKED AND I WISH YOU JOY
OF THE MONEY

IF THE VILLAIN HAD STOPPED HERE HIS CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY
AWFUL BUT HE BLACKENED HIS GUILT BY PROCEEDING TO TAKE ME INTO
CUSTODY WITH A RIGHT OF PATRONAGE THAT LEFT ALL HIS FORMER CRIMINALITY
FAR BEHIND

NOW YOU SEE JOSEPH AND WIFE SAID PUMBLECHOOK AS HE TOOK ME BY THE
ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW I AM ONE OF THEM THAT ALWAYS GO RIGHT THROUGH
WITH WHAT THEYVE BEGUN THIS BOY MUST BE BOUND OUT OF HAND THATS
MY WAY BOUND OUT OF HAND

GOODNESS KNOWS UNCLE PUMBLECHOOK SAID MY SISTER GRASPING THE
MONEY WERE DEEPLY BEHOLDEN TO YOU

NEVER MIND ME MUM RETURNED THAT DIABOLICAL CORNCHANDLER A
PLEASURES A PLEASURE ALL THE WORLD OVER BUT THIS BOY YOU KNOW WE
MUST HAVE HIM BOUND I SAID ID SEE TO ITTO TELL YOU THE TRUTH

THE JUSTICES WERE SITTING IN THE TOWN HALL NEAR AT HAND AND WE AT ONCE
WENT OVER TO HAVE ME BOUND APPRENTICE TO JOE IN THE MAGISTERIAL
PRESENCE I SAY WE WENT OVER BUT I WAS PUSHED OVER BY PUMBLECHOOK
EXACTLY AS IF I HAD THAT MOMENT PICKED A POCKET OR FIRED A RICK
INDEED IT WAS THE GENERAL IMPRESSION IN COURT THAT I HAD BEEN TAKEN
REDHANDED FOR AS PUMBLECHOOK SHOVED ME BEFORE HIM THROUGH THE CROWD
I HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY WHATS HE DONE AND OTHERS HES A YOUNG
UN TOO BUT LOOKS BAD DONT HE ONE PERSON OF MILD AND BENEVOLENT
ASPECT EVEN GAVE ME A TRACT ORNAMENTED WITH A WOODCUT OF A MALEVOLENT
YOUNG MAN FITTED UP WITH A PERFECT SAUSAGESHOP OF FETTERS AND
ENTITLED TO BE READ IN MY CELL

THE HALL WAS A QUEER PLACE I THOUGHT WITH HIGHER PEWS IN IT THAN A
CHURCHAND WITH PEOPLE HANGING OVER THE PEWS LOOKING ONAND WITH
MIGHTY JUSTICES ONE WITH A POWDERED HEAD LEANING BACK IN CHAIRS WITH
FOLDED ARMS OR TAKING SNUFF OR GOING TO SLEEP OR WRITING OR READING
THE NEWSPAPERSAND WITH SOME SHINING BLACK PORTRAITS ON THE WALLS
WHICH MY UNARTISTIC EYE REGARDED AS A COMPOSITION OF HARDBAKE AND
STICKINGPLASTER HERE IN A CORNER MY INDENTURES WERE DULY SIGNED AND
ATTESTED AND I WAS BOUND MR PUMBLECHOOK HOLDING ME ALL THE WHILE
AS IF WE HAD LOOKED IN ON OUR WAY TO THE SCAFFOLD TO HAVE THOSE LITTLE
PRELIMINARIES DISPOSED OF

WHEN WE HAD COME OUT AGAIN AND HAD GOT RID OF THE BOYS WHO HAD BEEN
PUT INTO GREAT SPIRITS BY THE EXPECTATION OF SEEING ME PUBLICLY
TORTURED AND WHO WERE MUCH DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT MY FRIENDS WERE
MERELY RALLYING ROUND ME WE WENT BACK TO PUMBLECHOOKS AND THERE MY
SISTER BECAME SO EXCITED BY THE TWENTYFIVE GUINEAS THAT NOTHING WOULD
SERVE HER BUT WE MUST HAVE A DINNER OUT OF THAT WINDFALL AT THE BLUE
BOAR AND THAT PUMBLECHOOK MUST GO OVER IN HIS CHAISECART AND BRING
THE HUBBLES AND MR WOPSLE

IT WAS AGREED TO BE DONE AND A MOST MELANCHOLY DAY I PASSED FOR IT
INSCRUTABLY APPEARED TO STAND TO REASON IN THE MINDS OF THE WHOLE
COMPANY THAT I WAS AN EXCRESCENCE ON THE ENTERTAINMENT AND TO MAKE IT
WORSE THEY ALL ASKED ME FROM TIME TO TIMEIN SHORT WHENEVER THEY HAD
NOTHING ELSE TO DOWHY I DIDNT ENJOY MYSELF AND WHAT COULD I
POSSIBLY DO THEN BUT SAY I WAS ENJOYING MYSELFWHEN I WASNT

HOWEVER THEY WERE GROWN UP AND HAD THEIR OWN WAY AND THEY MADE THE
MOST OF IT THAT SWINDLING PUMBLECHOOK EXALTED INTO THE BENEFICENT
CONTRIVER OF THE WHOLE OCCASION ACTUALLY TOOK THE TOP OF THE TABLE
AND WHEN HE ADDRESSED THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEING BOUND AND HAD
FIENDISHLY CONGRATULATED THEM ON MY BEING LIABLE TO IMPRISONMENT IF I
PLAYED AT CARDS DRANK STRONG LIQUORS KEPT LATE HOURS OR BAD COMPANY
OR INDULGED IN OTHER VAGARIES WHICH THE FORM OF MY INDENTURES APPEARED
TO CONTEMPLATE AS NEXT TO INEVITABLE HE PLACED ME STANDING ON A CHAIR
BESIDE HIM TO ILLUSTRATE HIS REMARKS

MY ONLY OTHER REMEMBRANCES OF THE GREAT FESTIVAL ARE THAT THEY
WOULDNT LET ME GO TO SLEEP BUT WHENEVER THEY SAW ME DROPPING OFF
WOKE ME UP AND TOLD ME TO ENJOY MYSELF THAT RATHER LATE IN THE
EVENING MR WOPSLE GAVE US COLLINSS ODE AND THREW HIS BLOODSTAINED
SWORD IN THUNDER DOWN WITH SUCH EFFECT THAT A WAITER CAME IN AND
SAID THE COMMERCIALS UNDERNEATH SENT UP THEIR COMPLIMENTS AND IT
WASNT THE TUMBLERS ARMS THAT THEY WERE ALL IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS ON
THE ROAD HOME AND SANG O LADY FAIR MR WOPSLE TAKING THE BASS AND
ASSERTING WITH A TREMENDOUSLY STRONG VOICE IN REPLY TO THE INQUISITIVE
BORE WHO LEADS THAT PIECE OF MUSIC IN A MOST IMPERTINENT MANNER BY
WANTING TO KNOW ALL ABOUT EVERYBODYS PRIVATE AFFAIRS THAT HE WAS
THE MAN WITH HIS WHITE LOCKS FLOWING AND THAT HE WAS UPON THE WHOLE
THE WEAKEST PILGRIM GOING

FINALLY I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I GOT INTO MY LITTLE BEDROOM I WAS TRULY
WRETCHED AND HAD A STRONG CONVICTION ON ME THAT I SHOULD NEVER LIKE
JOES TRADE I HAD LIKED IT ONCE BUT ONCE WAS NOT NOW




CHAPTER XIV


IT IS A MOST MISERABLE THING TO FEEL ASHAMED OF HOME THERE MAY BE
BLACK INGRATITUDE IN THE THING AND THE PUNISHMENT MAY BE RETRIBUTIVE
AND WELL DESERVED BUT THAT IT IS A MISERABLE THING I CAN TESTIFY

HOME HAD NEVER BEEN A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME BECAUSE OF MY SISTERS
TEMPER BUT JOE HAD SANCTIFIED IT AND I HAD BELIEVED IN IT I HAD
BELIEVED IN THE BEST PARLOUR AS A MOST ELEGANT SALOON I HAD BELIEVED
IN THE FRONT DOOR AS A MYSTERIOUS PORTAL OF THE TEMPLE OF STATE WHOSE
SOLEMN OPENING WAS ATTENDED WITH A SACRIFICE OF ROAST FOWLS I HAD
BELIEVED IN THE KITCHEN AS A CHASTE THOUGH NOT MAGNIFICENT APARTMENT I
HAD BELIEVED IN THE FORGE AS THE GLOWING ROAD TO MANHOOD AND
INDEPENDENCE WITHIN A SINGLE YEAR ALL THIS WAS CHANGED NOW IT WAS ALL
COARSE AND COMMON AND I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA
SEE IT ON ANY ACCOUNT

HOW MUCH OF MY UNGRACIOUS CONDITION OF MIND MAY HAVE BEEN MY OWN FAULT
HOW MUCH MISS HAVISHAMS HOW MUCH MY SISTERS IS NOW OF NO MOMENT TO
ME OR TO ANY ONE THE CHANGE WAS MADE IN ME THE THING WAS DONE WELL
OR ILL DONE EXCUSABLY OR INEXCUSABLY IT WAS DONE

ONCE IT HAD SEEMED TO ME THAT WHEN I SHOULD AT LAST ROLL UP MY
SHIRTSLEEVES AND GO INTO THE FORGE JOES PRENTICE I SHOULD BE
DISTINGUISHED AND HAPPY NOW THE REALITY WAS IN MY HOLD I ONLY FELT
THAT I WAS DUSTY WITH THE DUST OF SMALLCOAL AND THAT I HAD A WEIGHT
UPON MY DAILY REMEMBRANCE TO WHICH THE ANVIL WAS A FEATHER THERE HAVE
BEEN OCCASIONS IN MY LATER LIFE I SUPPOSE AS IN MOST LIVES WHEN I
HAVE FELT FOR A TIME AS IF A THICK CURTAIN HAD FALLEN ON ALL ITS
INTEREST AND ROMANCE TO SHUT ME OUT FROM ANYTHING SAVE DULL ENDURANCE
ANY MORE NEVER HAS THAT CURTAIN DROPPED SO HEAVY AND BLANK AS WHEN MY
WAY IN LIFE LAY STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE ME THROUGH THE NEWLY
ENTERED ROAD OF APPRENTICESHIP TO JOE

I REMEMBER THAT AT A LATER PERIOD OF MY TIME I USED TO STAND ABOUT
THE CHURCHYARD ON SUNDAY EVENINGS WHEN NIGHT WAS FALLING COMPARING MY
OWN PERSPECTIVE WITH THE WINDY MARSH VIEW AND MAKING OUT SOME LIKENESS
BETWEEN THEM BY THINKING HOW FLAT AND LOW BOTH WERE AND HOW ON BOTH
THERE CAME AN UNKNOWN WAY AND A DARK MIST AND THEN THE SEA I WAS QUITE
AS DEJECTED ON THE FIRST WORKINGDAY OF MY APPRENTICESHIP AS IN THAT
AFTERTIME BUT I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT I NEVER BREATHED A MURMUR TO JOE
WHILE MY INDENTURES LASTED IT IS ABOUT THE ONLY THING I AM GLAD TO
KNOW OF MYSELF IN THAT CONNECTION

FOR THOUGH IT INCLUDES WHAT I PROCEED TO ADD ALL THE MERIT OF WHAT I
PROCEED TO ADD WAS JOES IT WAS NOT BECAUSE I WAS FAITHFUL BUT
BECAUSE JOE WAS FAITHFUL THAT I NEVER RAN AWAY AND WENT FOR A SOLDIER
OR A SAILOR IT WAS NOT BECAUSE I HAD A STRONG SENSE OF THE VIRTUE OF
INDUSTRY BUT BECAUSE JOE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF THE VIRTUE OF INDUSTRY
THAT I WORKED WITH TOLERABLE ZEAL AGAINST THE GRAIN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
TO KNOW HOW FAR THE INFLUENCE OF ANY AMIABLE HONESTHEARTED DUTYDOING
MAN FLIES OUT INTO THE WORLD BUT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO KNOW HOW IT
HAS TOUCHED ONES SELF IN GOING BY AND I KNOW RIGHT WELL THAT ANY GOOD
THAT INTERMIXED ITSELF WITH MY APPRENTICESHIP CAME OF PLAIN CONTENTED
JOE AND NOT OF RESTLESSLY ASPIRING DISCONTENTED ME

WHAT I WANTED WHO CAN SAY HOW CAN I SAY WHEN I NEVER KNEW WHAT I
DREADED WAS THAT IN SOME UNLUCKY HOUR I BEING AT MY GRIMIEST AND
COMMONEST SHOULD LIFT UP MY EYES AND SEE ESTELLA LOOKING IN AT ONE OF
THE WOODEN WINDOWS OF THE FORGE I WAS HAUNTED BY THE FEAR THAT SHE
WOULD SOONER OR LATER FIND ME OUT WITH A BLACK FACE AND HANDS DOING
THE COARSEST PART OF MY WORK AND WOULD EXULT OVER ME AND DESPISE ME
OFTEN AFTER DARK WHEN I WAS PULLING THE BELLOWS FOR JOE AND WE WERE
SINGING OLD CLEM AND WHEN THE THOUGHT HOW WE USED TO SING IT AT MISS
HAVISHAMS WOULD SEEM TO SHOW ME ESTELLAS FACE IN THE FIRE WITH HER
PRETTY HAIR FLUTTERING IN THE WIND AND HER EYES SCORNING MEOFTEN AT
SUCH A TIME I WOULD LOOK TOWARDS THOSE PANELS OF BLACK NIGHT IN THE
WALL WHICH THE WOODEN WINDOWS THEN WERE AND WOULD FANCY THAT I SAW HER
JUST DRAWING HER FACE AWAY AND WOULD BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD COME AT
LAST

AFTER THAT WHEN WE WENT IN TO SUPPER THE PLACE AND THE MEAL WOULD
HAVE A MORE HOMELY LOOK THAN EVER AND I WOULD FEEL MORE ASHAMED OF
HOME THAN EVER IN MY OWN UNGRACIOUS BREAST




CHAPTER XV


AS I WAS GETTING TOO BIG FOR MR WOPSLES GREATAUNTS ROOM MY
EDUCATION UNDER THAT PREPOSTEROUS FEMALE TERMINATED NOT HOWEVER
UNTIL BIDDY HAD IMPARTED TO ME EVERYTHING SHE KNEW FROM THE LITTLE
CATALOGUE OF PRICES TO A COMIC SONG SHE HAD ONCE BOUGHT FOR A
HALFPENNY ALTHOUGH THE ONLY COHERENT PART OF THE LATTER PIECE OF
LITERATURE WERE THE OPENING LINES

WHEN I WENT TO LUNNON TOWN SIRS
TOO RUL LOO RUL
TOO RUL LOO RUL
WASNT I DONE VERY BROWN SIRS
TOO RUL LOO RUL
TOO RUL LOO RUL


STILL IN MY DESIRE TO BE WISER I GOT THIS COMPOSITION BY HEART WITH
THE UTMOST GRAVITY NOR DO I RECOLLECT THAT I QUESTIONED ITS MERIT
EXCEPT THAT I THOUGHT AS I STILL DO THE AMOUNT OF TOO RUL SOMEWHAT IN
EXCESS OF THE POETRY IN MY HUNGER FOR INFORMATION I MADE PROPOSALS TO
MR WOPSLE TO BESTOW SOME INTELLECTUAL CRUMBS UPON ME WITH WHICH HE
KINDLY COMPLIED AS IT TURNED OUT HOWEVER THAT HE ONLY WANTED ME FOR
A DRAMATIC LAYFIGURE TO BE CONTRADICTED AND EMBRACED AND WEPT OVER
AND BULLIED AND CLUTCHED AND STABBED AND KNOCKED ABOUT IN A VARIETY OF
WAYS I SOON DECLINED THAT COURSE OF INSTRUCTION THOUGH NOT UNTIL MR
WOPSLE IN HIS POETIC FURY HAD SEVERELY MAULED ME

WHATEVER I ACQUIRED I TRIED TO IMPART TO JOE THIS STATEMENT SOUNDS SO
WELL THAT I CANNOT IN MY CONSCIENCE LET IT PASS UNEXPLAINED I WANTED
TO MAKE JOE LESS IGNORANT AND COMMON THAT HE MIGHT BE WORTHIER OF MY
SOCIETY AND LESS OPEN TO ESTELLAS REPROACH

THE OLD BATTERY OUT ON THE MARSHES WAS OUR PLACE OF STUDY AND A BROKEN
SLATE AND A SHORT PIECE OF SLATEPENCIL WERE OUR EDUCATIONAL
IMPLEMENTS TO WHICH JOE ALWAYS ADDED A PIPE OF TOBACCO I NEVER KNEW
JOE TO REMEMBER ANYTHING FROM ONE SUNDAY TO ANOTHER OR TO ACQUIRE
UNDER MY TUITION ANY PIECE OF INFORMATION WHATEVER YET HE WOULD SMOKE
HIS PIPE AT THE BATTERY WITH A FAR MORE SAGACIOUS AIR THAN ANYWHERE
ELSEEVEN WITH A LEARNED AIRAS IF HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO BE
ADVANCING IMMENSELY DEAR FELLOW I HOPE HE DID

IT WAS PLEASANT AND QUIET OUT THERE WITH THE SAILS ON THE RIVER
PASSING BEYOND THE EARTHWORK AND SOMETIMES WHEN THE TIDE WAS LOW
LOOKING AS IF THEY BELONGED TO SUNKEN SHIPS THAT WERE STILL SAILING ON
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER WHENEVER I WATCHED THE VESSELS STANDING OUT
TO SEA WITH THEIR WHITE SAILS SPREAD I SOMEHOW THOUGHT OF MISS
HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA AND WHENEVER THE LIGHT STRUCK ASLANT AFAR OFF
UPON A CLOUD OR SAIL OR GREEN HILLSIDE OR WATERLINE IT WAS JUST THE
SAMEMISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA AND THE STRANGE HOUSE AND THE STRANGE
LIFE APPEARED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS
PICTURESQUE

ONE SUNDAY WHEN JOE GREATLY ENJOYING HIS PIPE HAD SO PLUMED HIMSELF
ON BEING MOST AWFUL DULL THAT I HAD GIVEN HIM UP FOR THE DAY I LAY
ON THE EARTHWORK FOR SOME TIME WITH MY CHIN ON MY HAND DESCRYING
TRACES OF MISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA ALL OVER THE PROSPECT IN THE SKY
AND IN THE WATER UNTIL AT LAST I RESOLVED TO MENTION A THOUGHT
CONCERNING THEM THAT HAD BEEN MUCH IN MY HEAD

JOE SAID I DONT YOU THINK I OUGHT TO MAKE MISS HAVISHAM A VISIT

WELL PIP RETURNED JOE SLOWLY CONSIDERING WHAT FOR

WHAT FOR JOE WHAT IS ANY VISIT MADE FOR

THERE IS SOME WISITS PRAPS SAID JOE AS FOR EVER REMAINS OPEN TO
THE QUESTION PIP BUT IN REGARD TO WISITING MISS HAVISHAM SHE MIGHT
THINK YOU WANTED SOMETHINGEXPECTED SOMETHING OF HER

DONT YOU THINK I MIGHT SAY THAT I DID NOT JOE

YOU MIGHT OLD CHAP SAID JOE AND SHE MIGHT CREDIT IT SIMILARLY
SHE MIGHTNT

JOE FELT AS I DID THAT HE HAD MADE A POINT THERE AND HE PULLED HARD
AT HIS PIPE TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM WEAKENING IT BY REPETITION

YOU SEE PIP JOE PURSUED AS SOON AS HE WAS PAST THAT DANGER MISS
HAVISHAM DONE THE HANDSOME THING BY YOU WHEN MISS HAVISHAM DONE THE
HANDSOME THING BY YOU SHE CALLED ME BACK TO SAY TO ME AS THAT WERE
ALL

YES JOE I HEARD HER

ALL JOE REPEATED VERY EMPHATICALLY

YES JOE I TELL YOU I HEARD HER

WHICH I MEANTERSAY PIP IT MIGHT BE THAT HER MEANING WEREMAKE A END
ON ITAS YOU WASME TO THE NORTH AND YOU TO THE SOUTHKEEP IN
SUNDERS

I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT TOO AND IT WAS VERY FAR FROM COMFORTING TO ME TO
FIND THAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF IT FOR IT SEEMED TO RENDER IT MORE
PROBABLE

BUT JOE

YES OLD CHAP

HERE AM I GETTING ON IN THE FIRST YEAR OF MY TIME AND SINCE THE DAY
OF MY BEING BOUND I HAVE NEVER THANKED MISS HAVISHAM OR ASKED AFTER
HER OR SHOWN THAT I REMEMBER HER

THATS TRUE PIP AND UNLESS YOU WAS TO TURN HER OUT A SET OF SHOES
ALL FOUR ROUNDAND WHICH I MEANTERSAY AS EVEN A SET OF SHOES ALL FOUR
ROUND MIGHT NOT BE ACCEPTABLE AS A PRESENT IN A TOTAL WACANCY OF
HOOFS

I DONT MEAN THAT SORT OF REMEMBRANCE JOE I DONT MEAN A PRESENT

BUT JOE HAD GOT THE IDEA OF A PRESENT IN HIS HEAD AND MUST HARP UPON
IT OR EVEN SAID HE IF YOU WAS HELPED TO KNOCKING HER UP A NEW
CHAIN FOR THE FRONT DOOROR SAY A GROSS OR TWO OF SHARKHEADED SCREWS
FOR GENERAL USEOR SOME LIGHT FANCY ARTICLE SUCH AS A TOASTINGFORK
WHEN SHE TOOK HER MUFFINSOR A GRIDIRON WHEN SHE TOOK A SPRAT OR SUCH
LIKE

I DONT MEAN ANY PRESENT AT ALL JOE I INTERPOSED

WELL SAID JOE STILL HARPING ON IT AS THOUGH I HAD PARTICULARLY
PRESSED IT IF I WAS YOURSELF PIP I WOULDNT NO I WOULD NOT FOR
WHATS A DOORCHAIN WHEN SHES GOT ONE ALWAYS UP AND SHARKHEADERS IS
OPEN TO MISREPRESENTATIONS AND IF IT WAS A TOASTINGFORK YOUD GO
INTO BRASS AND DO YOURSELF NO CREDIT AND THE ONCOMMONEST WORKMAN CANT
SHOW HIMSELF ONCOMMON IN A GRIDIRONFOR A GRIDIRON IS A GRIDIRON
SAID JOE STEADFASTLY IMPRESSING IT UPON ME AS IF HE WERE ENDEAVOURING
TO ROUSE ME FROM A FIXED DELUSION AND YOU MAY HAIM AT WHAT YOU LIKE
BUT A GRIDIRON IT WILL COME OUT EITHER BY YOUR LEAVE OR AGAIN YOUR
LEAVE AND YOU CANT HELP YOURSELF

MY DEAR JOE I CRIED IN DESPERATION TAKING HOLD OF HIS COAT DONT
GO ON IN THAT WAY I NEVER THOUGHT OF MAKING MISS HAVISHAM ANY
PRESENT

NO PIP JOE ASSENTED AS IF HE HAD BEEN CONTENDING FOR THAT ALL
ALONG AND WHAT I SAY TO YOU IS YOU ARE RIGHT PIP

YES JOE BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS THAT AS WE ARE RATHER SLACK
JUST NOW IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME A HALFHOLIDAY TOMORROW I THINK I
WOULD GO UPTOWN AND MAKE A CALL ON MISS ESTHAVISHAM

WHICH HER NAME SAID JOE GRAVELY AINT ESTAVISHAM PIP UNLESS SHE
HAVE BEEN RECHRISENED

I KNOW JOE I KNOW IT WAS A SLIP OF MINE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
JOE

IN BRIEF JOE THOUGHT THAT IF I THOUGHT WELL OF IT HE THOUGHT WELL OF
IT BUT HE WAS PARTICULAR IN STIPULATING THAT IF I WERE NOT RECEIVED
WITH CORDIALITY OR IF I WERE NOT ENCOURAGED TO REPEAT MY VISIT AS A
VISIT WHICH HAD NO ULTERIOR OBJECT BUT WAS SIMPLY ONE OF GRATITUDE FOR
A FAVOUR RECEIVED THEN THIS EXPERIMENTAL TRIP SHOULD HAVE NO
SUCCESSOR BY THESE CONDITIONS I PROMISED TO ABIDE

NOW JOE KEPT A JOURNEYMAN AT WEEKLY WAGES WHOSE NAME WAS ORLICK HE
PRETENDED THAT HIS CHRISTIAN NAME WAS DOLGEA CLEAR IMPOSSIBILITYBUT
HE WAS A FELLOW OF THAT OBSTINATE DISPOSITION THAT I BELIEVE HIM TO
HAVE BEEN THE PREY OF NO DELUSION IN THIS PARTICULAR BUT WILFULLY TO
HAVE IMPOSED THAT NAME UPON THE VILLAGE AS AN AFFRONT TO ITS
UNDERSTANDING HE WAS A BROADSHOULDERED LOOSELIMBED SWARTHY FELLOW OF
GREAT STRENGTH NEVER IN A HURRY AND ALWAYS SLOUCHING HE NEVER EVEN
SEEMED TO COME TO HIS WORK ON PURPOSE BUT WOULD SLOUCH IN AS IF BY
MERE ACCIDENT AND WHEN HE WENT TO THE JOLLY BARGEMEN TO EAT HIS
DINNER OR WENT AWAY AT NIGHT HE WOULD SLOUCH OUT LIKE CAIN OR THE
WANDERING JEW AS IF HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS GOING AND NO INTENTION
OF EVER COMING BACK HE LODGED AT A SLUICEKEEPERS OUT ON THE MARSHES
AND ON WORKINGDAYS WOULD COME SLOUCHING FROM HIS HERMITAGE WITH HIS
HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND HIS DINNER LOOSELY TIED IN A BUNDLE ROUND HIS
NECK AND DANGLING ON HIS BACK ON SUNDAYS HE MOSTLY LAY ALL DAY ON THE
SLUICEGATES OR STOOD AGAINST RICKS AND BARNS HE ALWAYS SLOUCHED
LOCOMOTIVELY WITH HIS EYES ON THE GROUND AND WHEN ACCOSTED OR
OTHERWISE REQUIRED TO RAISE THEM HE LOOKED UP IN A HALFRESENTFUL
HALFPUZZLED WAY AS THOUGH THE ONLY THOUGHT HE EVER HAD WAS THAT IT
WAS RATHER AN ODD AND INJURIOUS FACT THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE THINKING

THIS MOROSE JOURNEYMAN HAD NO LIKING FOR ME WHEN I WAS VERY SMALL AND
TIMID HE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEVIL LIVED IN A BLACK CORNER
OF THE FORGE AND THAT HE KNEW THE FIEND VERY WELL ALSO THAT IT WAS
NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE FIRE ONCE IN SEVEN YEARS WITH A LIVE BOY
AND THAT I MIGHT CONSIDER MYSELF FUEL WHEN I BECAME JOES PRENTICE
ORLICK WAS PERHAPS CONFIRMED IN SOME SUSPICION THAT I SHOULD DISPLACE
HIM HOWBEIT HE LIKED ME STILL LESS NOT THAT HE EVER SAID ANYTHING
OR DID ANYTHING OPENLY IMPORTING HOSTILITY I ONLY NOTICED THAT HE
ALWAYS BEAT HIS SPARKS IN MY DIRECTION AND THAT WHENEVER I SANG OLD
CLEM HE CAME IN OUT OF TIME

DOLGE ORLICK WAS AT WORK AND PRESENT NEXT DAY WHEN I REMINDED JOE OF
MY HALFHOLIDAY HE SAID NOTHING AT THE MOMENT FOR HE AND JOE HAD JUST
GOT A PIECE OF HOT IRON BETWEEN THEM AND I WAS AT THE BELLOWS BUT BY
AND BY HE SAID LEANING ON HIS HAMMER

NOW MASTER SURE YOURE NOT AGOING TO FAVOUR ONLY ONE OF US IF
YOUNG PIP HAS A HALFHOLIDAY DO AS MUCH FOR OLD ORLICK I SUPPOSE HE
WAS ABOUT FIVEANDTWENTY BUT HE USUALLY SPOKE OF HIMSELF AS AN
ANCIENT PERSON

WHY WHATLL YOU DO WITH A HALFHOLIDAY IF YOU GET IT SAID JOE

WHATLL I DO WITH IT WHATLL HE DO WITH IT ILL DO AS MUCH WITH
IT AS HIM SAID ORLICK

AS TO PIP HES GOING UP TOWN SAID JOE

WELL THEN AS TO OLD ORLICK HES AGOING UP TOWN RETORTED THAT
WORTHY TWO CAN GO UP TOWN TAINT ONLY ONE WOT CAN GO UP TOWN

DONT LOSE YOUR TEMPER SAID JOE

SHALL IF I LIKE GROWLED ORLICK SOME AND THEIR UPTOWNING NOW
MASTER COME NO FAVOURING IN THIS SHOP BE A MAN

THE MASTER REFUSING TO ENTERTAIN THE SUBJECT UNTIL THE JOURNEYMAN WAS
IN A BETTER TEMPER ORLICK PLUNGED AT THE FURNACE DREW OUT A REDHOT
BAR MADE AT ME WITH IT AS IF HE WERE GOING TO RUN IT THROUGH MY BODY
WHISKED IT ROUND MY HEAD LAID IT ON THE ANVIL HAMMERED IT OUTAS IF
IT WERE I I THOUGHT AND THE SPARKS WERE MY SPIRTING BLOODAND
FINALLY SAID WHEN HE HAD HAMMERED HIMSELF HOT AND THE IRON COLD AND
HE AGAIN LEANED ON HIS HAMMER

NOW MASTER

AH I AM ALL RIGHT SAID GRUFF OLD ORLICK

THEN AS IN GENERAL YOU STICK TO YOUR WORK AS WELL AS MOST MEN SAID
JOE LET IT BE A HALFHOLIDAY FOR ALL

MY SISTER HAD BEEN STANDING SILENT IN THE YARD WITHIN HEARINGSHE WAS
A MOST UNSCRUPULOUS SPY AND LISTENERAND SHE INSTANTLY LOOKED IN AT
ONE OF THE WINDOWS

LIKE YOU YOU FOOL SAID SHE TO JOE GIVING HOLIDAYS TO GREAT IDLE
HULKERS LIKE THAT YOU ARE A RICH MAN UPON MY LIFE TO WASTE WAGES IN
THAT WAY I WISH I WAS HIS MASTER

YOUD BE EVERYBODYS MASTER IF YOU DURST RETORTED ORLICK WITH AN
ILLFAVOURED GRIN

LET HER ALONE SAID JOE

ID BE A MATCH FOR ALL NOODLES AND ALL ROGUES RETURNED MY SISTER
BEGINNING TO WORK HERSELF INTO A MIGHTY RAGE AND I COULDNT BE A
MATCH FOR THE NOODLES WITHOUT BEING A MATCH FOR YOUR MASTER WHOS THE
DUNDERHEADED KING OF THE NOODLES AND I COULDNT BE A MATCH FOR THE
ROGUES WITHOUT BEING A MATCH FOR YOU WHO ARE THE BLACKESTLOOKING AND
THE WORST ROGUE BETWEEN THIS AND FRANCE NOW

YOURE A FOUL SHREW MOTHER GARGERY GROWLED THE JOURNEYMAN IF THAT
MAKES A JUDGE OF ROGUES YOU OUGHT TO BE A GOODUN

LET HER ALONE WILL YOU SAID JOE

WHAT DID YOU SAY CRIED MY SISTER BEGINNING TO SCREAM WHAT DID YOU
SAY WHAT DID THAT FELLOW ORLICK SAY TO ME PIP WHAT DID HE CALL ME
WITH MY HUSBAND STANDING BY OH OH OH EACH OF THESE EXCLAMATIONS
WAS A SHRIEK AND I MUST REMARK OF MY SISTER WHAT IS EQUALLY TRUE OF
ALL THE VIOLENT WOMEN I HAVE EVER SEEN THAT PASSION WAS NO EXCUSE FOR
HER BECAUSE IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT INSTEAD OF LAPSING INTO PASSION SHE
CONSCIOUSLY AND DELIBERATELY TOOK EXTRAORDINARY PAINS TO FORCE HERSELF
INTO IT AND BECAME BLINDLY FURIOUS BY REGULAR STAGES WHAT WAS THE
NAME HE GAVE ME BEFORE THE BASE MAN WHO SWORE TO DEFEND ME OH HOLD
ME OH

AHHH GROWLED THE JOURNEYMAN BETWEEN HIS TEETH ID HOLD YOU IF
YOU WAS MY WIFE ID HOLD YOU UNDER THE PUMP AND CHOKE IT OUT OF YOU

I TELL YOU LET HER ALONE SAID JOE

OH TO HEAR HIM CRIED MY SISTER WITH A CLAP OF HER HANDS AND A
SCREAM TOGETHERWHICH WAS HER NEXT STAGE TO HEAR THE NAMES HES
GIVING ME THAT ORLICK IN MY OWN HOUSE ME A MARRIED WOMAN WITH MY
HUSBAND STANDING BY OH OH HERE MY SISTER AFTER A FIT OF CLAPPINGS
AND SCREAMINGS BEAT HER HANDS UPON HER BOSOM AND UPON HER KNEES AND
THREW HER CAP OFF AND PULLED HER HAIR DOWNWHICH WERE THE LAST STAGES
ON HER ROAD TO FRENZY BEING BY THIS TIME A PERFECT FURY AND A COMPLETE
SUCCESS SHE MADE A DASH AT THE DOOR WHICH I HAD FORTUNATELY LOCKED

WHAT COULD THE WRETCHED JOE DO NOW AFTER HIS DISREGARDED PARENTHETICAL
INTERRUPTIONS BUT STAND UP TO HIS JOURNEYMAN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE
MEANT BY INTERFERING BETWIXT HIMSELF AND MRS JOE AND FURTHER WHETHER
HE WAS MAN ENOUGH TO COME ON OLD ORLICK FELT THAT THE SITUATION
ADMITTED OF NOTHING LESS THAN COMING ON AND WAS ON HIS DEFENCE
STRAIGHTWAY SO WITHOUT SO MUCH AS PULLING OFF THEIR SINGED AND BURNT
APRONS THEY WENT AT ONE ANOTHER LIKE TWO GIANTS BUT IF ANY MAN IN
THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD COULD STAND UPLONG AGAINST JOE I NEVER SAW THE MAN
ORLICK AS IF HE HAD BEEN OF NO MORE ACCOUNT THAN THE PALE YOUNG
GENTLEMAN WAS VERY SOON AMONG THE COALDUST AND IN NO HURRY TO COME
OUT OF IT THEN JOE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND PICKED UP MY SISTER WHO HAD
DROPPED INSENSIBLE AT THE WINDOW BUT WHO HAD SEEN THE FIGHT FIRST I
THINK AND WHO WAS CARRIED INTO THE HOUSE AND LAID DOWN AND WHO WAS
RECOMMENDED TO REVIVE AND WOULD DO NOTHING BUT STRUGGLE AND CLENCH HER
HANDS IN JOES HAIR THEN CAME THAT SINGULAR CALM AND SILENCE WHICH
SUCCEED ALL UPROARS AND THEN WITH THE VAGUE SENSATION WHICH I HAVE
ALWAYS CONNECTED WITH SUCH A LULLNAMELY THAT IT WAS SUNDAY AND
SOMEBODY WAS DEADI WENT UPSTAIRS TO DRESS MYSELF

ILLUSTRATION

WHEN I CAME DOWN AGAIN I FOUND JOE AND ORLICK SWEEPING UP WITHOUT ANY
OTHER TRACES OF DISCOMPOSURE THAN A SLIT IN ONE OF ORLICKS NOSTRILS
WHICH WAS NEITHER EXPRESSIVE NOR ORNAMENTAL A POT OF BEER HAD APPEARED
FROM THE JOLLY BARGEMEN AND THEY WERE SHARING IT BY TURNS IN A
PEACEABLE MANNER THE LULL HAD A SEDATIVE AND PHILOSOPHICAL INFLUENCE
ON JOE WHO FOLLOWED ME OUT INTO THE ROAD TO SAY AS A PARTING
OBSERVATION THAT MIGHT DO ME GOOD ON THE RAMPAGE PIP AND OFF THE
RAMPAGE PIPSUCH IS LIFE

WITH WHAT ABSURD EMOTIONS FOR WE THINK THE FEELINGS THAT ARE VERY
SERIOUS IN A MAN QUITE COMICAL IN A BOY I FOUND MYSELF AGAIN GOING TO
MISS HAVISHAMS MATTERS LITTLE HERE NOR HOW I PASSED AND REPASSED
THE GATE MANY TIMES BEFORE I COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO RING NOR HOW I
DEBATED WHETHER I SHOULD GO AWAY WITHOUT RINGING NOR HOW I SHOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE GONE IF MY TIME HAD BEEN MY OWN TO COME BACK

MISS SARAH POCKET CAME TO THE GATE NO ESTELLA

HOW THEN YOU HERE AGAIN SAID MISS POCKET WHAT DO YOU WANT

WHEN I SAID THAT I ONLY CAME TO SEE HOW MISS HAVISHAM WAS SARAH
EVIDENTLY DELIBERATED WHETHER OR NO SHE SHOULD SEND ME ABOUT MY
BUSINESS BUT UNWILLING TO HAZARD THE RESPONSIBILITY SHE LET ME IN
AND PRESENTLY BROUGHT THE SHARP MESSAGE THAT I WAS TO COME UP

EVERYTHING WAS UNCHANGED AND MISS HAVISHAM WAS ALONE

WELL SAID SHE FIXING HER EYES UPON ME I HOPE YOU WANT NOTHING
YOULL GET NOTHING

NO INDEED MISS HAVISHAM I ONLY WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM DOING
VERY WELL IN MY APPRENTICESHIP AND AM ALWAYS MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU

THERE THERE WITH THE OLD RESTLESS FINGERS COME NOW AND THEN COME
ON YOUR BIRTHDAYAY SHE CRIED SUDDENLY TURNING HERSELF AND HER
CHAIR TOWARDS ME YOU ARE LOOKING ROUND FOR ESTELLA HEY

I HAD BEEN LOOKING ROUNDIN FACT FOR ESTELLAAND I STAMMERED THAT I
HOPED SHE WAS WELL

ABROAD SAID MISS HAVISHAM EDUCATING FOR A LADY FAR OUT OF REACH
PRETTIER THAN EVER ADMIRED BY ALL WHO SEE HER DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU
HAVE LOST HER

THERE WAS SUCH A MALIGNANT ENJOYMENT IN HER UTTERANCE OF THE LAST
WORDS AND SHE BROKE INTO SUCH A DISAGREEABLE LAUGH THAT I WAS AT A
LOSS WHAT TO SAY SHE SPARED ME THE TROUBLE OF CONSIDERING BY
DISMISSING ME WHEN THE GATE WAS CLOSED UPON ME BY SARAH OF THE
WALNUTSHELL COUNTENANCE I FELT MORE THAN EVER DISSATISFIED WITH MY
HOME AND WITH MY TRADE AND WITH EVERYTHING AND THAT WAS ALL I TOOK BY
THAT MOTION

AS I WAS LOITERING ALONG THE HIGH STREET LOOKING IN DISCONSOLATELY AT
THE SHOP WINDOWS AND THINKING WHAT I WOULD BUY IF I WERE A GENTLEMAN
WHO SHOULD COME OUT OF THE BOOKSHOP BUT MR WOPSLE MR WOPSLE HAD IN
HIS HAND THE AFFECTING TRAGEDY OF GEORGE BARNWELL IN WHICH HE HAD THAT
MOMENT INVESTED SIXPENCE WITH THE VIEW OF HEAPING EVERY WORD OF IT ON
THE HEAD OF PUMBLECHOOK WITH WHOM HE WAS GOING TO DRINK TEA NO SOONER
DID HE SEE ME THAN HE APPEARED TO CONSIDER THAT A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE
HAD PUT A PRENTICE IN HIS WAY TO BE READ AT AND HE LAID HOLD OF ME
AND INSISTED ON MY ACCOMPANYING HIM TO THE PUMBLECHOOKIAN PARLOUR AS I
KNEW IT WOULD BE MISERABLE AT HOME AND AS THE NIGHTS WERE DARK AND THE
WAY WAS DREARY AND ALMOST ANY COMPANIONSHIP ON THE ROAD WAS BETTER
THAN NONE I MADE NO GREAT RESISTANCE CONSEQUENTLY WE TURNED INTO
PUMBLECHOOKS JUST AS THE STREET AND THE SHOPS WERE LIGHTING UP

AS I NEVER ASSISTED AT ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OF GEORGE BARNWELL I
DONT KNOW HOW LONG IT MAY USUALLY TAKE BUT I KNOW VERY WELL THAT IT
TOOK UNTIL HALFPAST NINE O CLOCK THAT NIGHT AND THAT WHEN MR WOPSLE
GOT INTO NEWGATE I THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD GO TO THE SCAFFOLD HE
BECAME SO MUCH SLOWER THAN AT ANY FORMER PERIOD OF HIS DISGRACEFUL
CAREER I THOUGHT IT A LITTLE TOO MUCH THAT HE SHOULD COMPLAIN OF BEING
CUT SHORT IN HIS FLOWER AFTER ALL AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RUNNING TO
SEED LEAF AFTER LEAF EVER SINCE HIS COURSE BEGAN THIS HOWEVER WAS
A MERE QUESTION OF LENGTH AND WEARISOMENESS WHAT STUNG ME WAS THE
IDENTIFICATION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR WITH MY UNOFFENDING SELF WHEN
BARNWELL BEGAN TO GO WRONG I DECLARE THAT I FELT POSITIVELY
APOLOGETIC PUMBLECHOOKS INDIGNANT STARE SO TAXED ME WITH IT WOPSLE
TOO TOOK PAINS TO PRESENT ME IN THE WORST LIGHT AT ONCE FEROCIOUS AND
MAUDLIN I WAS MADE TO MURDER MY UNCLE WITH NO EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER MILLWOOD PUT ME DOWN IN ARGUMENT ON EVERY
OCCASION IT BECAME SHEER MONOMANIA IN MY MASTERS DAUGHTER TO CARE A
BUTTON FOR ME AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MY GASPING AND PROCRASTINATING
CONDUCT ON THE FATAL MORNING IS THAT IT WAS WORTHY OF THE GENERAL
FEEBLENESS OF MY CHARACTER EVEN AFTER I WAS HAPPILY HANGED AND WOPSLE
HAD CLOSED THE BOOK PUMBLECHOOK SAT STARING AT ME AND SHAKING HIS
HEAD AND SAYING TAKE WARNING BOY TAKE WARNING AS IF IT WERE A
WELLKNOWN FACT THAT I CONTEMPLATED MURDERING A NEAR RELATION PROVIDED
I COULD ONLY INDUCE ONE TO HAVE THE WEAKNESS TO BECOME MY BENEFACTOR

IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER AND WHEN I SET OUT WITH
MR WOPSLE ON THE WALK HOME BEYOND TOWN WE FOUND A HEAVY MIST OUT
AND IT FELL WET AND THICK THE TURNPIKE LAMP WAS A BLUR QUITE OUT OF
THE LAMPS USUAL PLACE APPARENTLY AND ITS RAYS LOOKED SOLID SUBSTANCE
ON THE FOG WE WERE NOTICING THIS AND SAYING HOW THAT THE MIST ROSE
WITH A CHANGE OF WIND FROM A CERTAIN QUARTER OF OUR MARSHES WHEN WE
CAME UPON A MAN SLOUCHING UNDER THE LEE OF THE TURNPIKE HOUSE

HALLOA WE SAID STOPPING ORLICK THERE

AH HE ANSWERED SLOUCHING OUT I WAS STANDING BY A MINUTE ON THE
CHANCE OF COMPANY

YOU ARE LATE I REMARKED

ORLICK NOT UNNATURALLY ANSWERED WELL AND YOURE LATE

WE HAVE BEEN SAID MR WOPSLE EXALTED WITH HIS LATE PERFORMANCEWE
HAVE BEEN INDULGING MR ORLICK IN AN INTELLECTUAL EVENING

OLD ORLICK GROWLED AS IF HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND WE ALL
WENT ON TOGETHER I ASKED HIM PRESENTLY WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SPENDING
HIS HALFHOLIDAY UP AND DOWN TOWN

YES SAID HE ALL OF IT I COME IN BEHIND YOURSELF I DIDNT SEE
YOU BUT I MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLOSE BEHIND YOU BY THE BY THE GUNS
IS GOING AGAIN

AT THE HULKS SAID I

AY THERES SOME OF THE BIRDS FLOWN FROM THE CAGES THE GUNS HAVE BEEN
GOING SINCE DARK ABOUT YOULL HEAR ONE PRESENTLY

IN EFFECT WE HAD NOT WALKED MANY YARDS FURTHER WHEN THE
WELLREMEMBERED BOOM CAME TOWARDS US DEADENED BY THE MIST AND HEAVILY
ROLLED AWAY ALONG THE LOW GROUNDS BY THE RIVER AS IF IT WERE PURSUING
AND THREATENING THE FUGITIVES

A GOOD NIGHT FOR CUTTING OFF IN SAID ORLICK WED BE PUZZLED HOW TO
BRING DOWN A JAILBIRD ON THE WING TONIGHT

THE SUBJECT WAS A SUGGESTIVE ONE TO ME AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN
SILENCE MR WOPSLE AS THE ILLREQUITED UNCLE OF THE EVENINGS
TRAGEDY FELL TO MEDITATING ALOUD IN HIS GARDEN AT CAMBERWELL ORLICK
WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS SLOUCHED HEAVILY AT MY SIDE IT WAS VERY
DARK VERY WET VERY MUDDY AND SO WE SPLASHED ALONG NOW AND THEN THE
SOUND OF THE SIGNAL CANNON BROKE UPON US AGAIN AND AGAIN ROLLED
SULKILY ALONG THE COURSE OF THE RIVER I KEPT MYSELF TO MYSELF AND MY
THOUGHTS MR WOPSLE DIED AMIABLY AT CAMBERWELL AND EXCEEDINGLY GAME
ON BOSWORTH FIELD AND IN THE GREATEST AGONIES AT GLASTONBURY ORLICK
SOMETIMES GROWLED BEAT IT OUT BEAT IT OUTOLD CLEM WITH A CLINK
FOR THE STOUTOLD CLEM I THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN DRINKING BUT HE WAS
NOT DRUNK

THUS WE CAME TO THE VILLAGE THE WAY BY WHICH WE APPROACHED IT TOOK US
PAST THE THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN WHICH WE WERE SURPRISED TO FINDIT BEING
ELEVEN OCLOCKIN A STATE OF COMMOTION WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN AND
UNWONTED LIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN HASTILY CAUGHT UP AND PUT DOWN SCATTERED
ABOUT MR WOPSLE DROPPED IN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SURMISING THAT
A CONVICT HAD BEEN TAKEN BUT CAME RUNNING OUT IN A GREAT HURRY

THERES SOMETHING WRONG SAID HE WITHOUT STOPPING UP AT YOUR
PLACE PIP RUN ALL

WHAT IS IT I ASKED KEEPING UP WITH HIM SO DID ORLICK AT MY SIDE

I CANT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE HOUSE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY
ENTERED WHEN JOE GARGERY WAS OUT SUPPOSED BY CONVICTS SOMEBODY HAS
BEEN ATTACKED AND HURT

WE WERE RUNNING TOO FAST TO ADMIT OF MORE BEING SAID AND WE MADE NO
STOP UNTIL WE GOT INTO OUR KITCHEN IT WAS FULL OF PEOPLE THE WHOLE
VILLAGE WAS THERE OR IN THE YARD AND THERE WAS A SURGEON AND THERE
WAS JOE AND THERE WERE A GROUP OF WOMEN ALL ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDST
OF THE KITCHEN THE UNEMPLOYED BYSTANDERS DREW BACK WHEN THEY SAW ME
AND SO I BECAME AWARE OF MY SISTERLYING WITHOUT SENSE OR MOVEMENT ON
THE BARE BOARDS WHERE SHE HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BY A TREMENDOUS BLOW ON
THE BACK OF THE HEAD DEALT BY SOME UNKNOWN HAND WHEN HER FACE WAS
TURNED TOWARDS THE FIREDESTINED NEVER TO BE ON THE RAMPAGE AGAIN
WHILE SHE WAS THE WIFE OF JOE




CHAPTER XVI


WITH MY HEAD FULL OF GEORGE BARNWELL I WAS AT FIRST DISPOSED TO
BELIEVE THAT I MUST HAVE HAD SOME HAND IN THE ATTACK UPON MY SISTER
OR AT ALL EVENTS THAT AS HER NEAR RELATION POPULARLY KNOWN TO BE UNDER
OBLIGATIONS TO HER I WAS A MORE LEGITIMATE OBJECT OF SUSPICION THAN
ANY ONE ELSE BUT WHEN IN THE CLEARER LIGHT OF NEXT MORNING I BEGAN
TO RECONSIDER THE MATTER AND TO HEAR IT DISCUSSED AROUND ME ON ALL
SIDES I TOOK ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CASE WHICH WAS MORE REASONABLE

JOE HAD BEEN AT THE THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN SMOKING HIS PIPE FROM A
QUARTER AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK TO A QUARTER BEFORE TEN WHILE HE WAS
THERE MY SISTER HAD BEEN SEEN STANDING AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND HAD
EXCHANGED GOOD NIGHT WITH A FARMLABOURER GOING HOME THE MAN COULD NOT
BE MORE PARTICULAR AS TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE SAW HER HE GOT INTO
DENSE CONFUSION WHEN HE TRIED TO BE THAN THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN
BEFORE NINE WHEN JOE WENT HOME AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE TEN HE FOUND
HER STRUCK DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PROMPTLY CALLED IN ASSISTANCE THE
FIRE HAD NOT THEN BURNT UNUSUALLY LOW NOR WAS THE SNUFF OF THE CANDLE
VERY LONG THE CANDLE HOWEVER HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT

NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM ANY PART OF THE HOUSE NEITHER BEYOND
THE BLOWING OUT OF THE CANDLEWHICH STOOD ON A TABLE BETWEEN THE DOOR
AND MY SISTER AND WAS BEHIND HER WHEN SHE STOOD FACING THE FIRE AND
WAS STRUCKWAS THERE ANY DISARRANGEMENT OF THE KITCHEN EXCEPTING SUCH
AS SHE HERSELF HAD MADE IN FALLING AND BLEEDING BUT THERE WAS ONE
REMARKABLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE ON THE SPOT SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH
SOMETHING BLUNT AND HEAVY ON THE HEAD AND SPINE AFTER THE BLOWS WERE
DEALT SOMETHING HEAVY HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN AT HER WITH CONSIDERABLE
VIOLENCE AS SHE LAY ON HER FACE AND ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER WHEN
JOE PICKED HER UP WAS A CONVICTS LEGIRON WHICH HAD BEEN FILED
ASUNDER

NOW JOE EXAMINING THIS IRON WITH A SMITHS EYE DECLARED IT TO HAVE
BEEN FILED ASUNDER SOME TIME AGO THE HUE AND CRY GOING OFF TO THE
HULKS AND PEOPLE COMING THENCE TO EXAMINE THE IRON JOES OPINION WAS
CORROBORATED THEY DID NOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY WHEN IT HAD LEFT THE
PRISONSHIPS TO WHICH IT UNDOUBTEDLY HAD ONCE BELONGED BUT THEY
CLAIMED TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THAT PARTICULAR MANACLE HAD NOT BEEN
WORN BY EITHER OF THE TWO CONVICTS WHO HAD ESCAPED LAST NIGHT FURTHER
ONE OF THOSE TWO WAS ALREADY RETAKEN AND HAD NOT FREED HIMSELF OF HIS
IRON

KNOWING WHAT I KNEW I SET UP AN INFERENCE OF MY OWN HERE I BELIEVED
THE IRON TO BE MY CONVICTS IRONTHE IRON I HAD SEEN AND HEARD HIM
FILING AT ON THE MARSHESBUT MY MIND DID NOT ACCUSE HIM OF HAVING PUT
IT TO ITS LATEST USE FOR I BELIEVED ONE OF TWO OTHER PERSONS TO HAVE
BECOME POSSESSED OF IT AND TO HAVE TURNED IT TO THIS CRUEL ACCOUNT
EITHER ORLICK OR THE STRANGE MAN WHO HAD SHOWN ME THE FILE

NOW AS TO ORLICK HE HAD GONE TO TOWN EXACTLY AS HE TOLD US WHEN WE
PICKED HIM UP AT THE TURNPIKE HE HAD BEEN SEEN ABOUT TOWN ALL THE
EVENING HE HAD BEEN IN DIVERS COMPANIES IN SEVERAL PUBLICHOUSES AND
HE HAD COME BACK WITH MYSELF AND MR WOPSLE THERE WAS NOTHING AGAINST
HIM SAVE THE QUARREL AND MY SISTER HAD QUARRELLED WITH HIM AND WITH
EVERYBODY ELSE ABOUT HER TEN THOUSAND TIMES AS TO THE STRANGE MAN IF
HE HAD COME BACK FOR HIS TWO BANKNOTES THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO
DISPUTE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE MY SISTER WAS FULLY PREPARED TO RESTORE
THEM BESIDES THERE HAD BEEN NO ALTERCATION THE ASSAILANT HAD COME IN
SO SILENTLY AND SUDDENLY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FELLED BEFORE SHE COULD
LOOK ROUND

IT WAS HORRIBLE TO THINK THAT I HAD PROVIDED THE WEAPON HOWEVER
UNDESIGNEDLY BUT I COULD HARDLY THINK OTHERWISE I SUFFERED
UNSPEAKABLE TROUBLE WHILE I CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED WHETHER I
SHOULD AT LAST DISSOLVE THAT SPELL OF MY CHILDHOOD AND TELL JOE ALL THE
STORY FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS I EVERY DAY SETTLED THE QUESTION FINALLY
IN THE NEGATIVE AND REOPENED AND REARGUED IT NEXT MORNING THE
CONTENTION CAME AFTER ALL TO THISTHE SECRET WAS SUCH AN OLD ONE
NOW HAD SO GROWN INTO ME AND BECOME A PART OF MYSELF THAT I COULD NOT
TEAR IT AWAY IN ADDITION TO THE DREAD THAT HAVING LED UP TO SO MUCH
MISCHIEF IT WOULD BE NOW MORE LIKELY THAN EVER TO ALIENATE JOE FROM ME
IF HE BELIEVED IT I HAD A FURTHER RESTRAINING DREAD THAT HE WOULD NOT
BELIEVE IT BUT WOULD ASSORT IT WITH THE FABULOUS DOGS AND VEALCUTLETS
AS A MONSTROUS INVENTION HOWEVER I TEMPORIZED WITH MYSELF OF
COURSEFOR WAS I NOT WAVERING BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG WHEN THE THING
IS ALWAYS DONEAND RESOLVED TO MAKE A FULL DISCLOSURE IF I SHOULD SEE
ANY SUCH NEW OCCASION AS A NEW CHANCE OF HELPING IN THE DISCOVERY OF
THE ASSAILANT

THE CONSTABLES AND THE BOW STREET MEN FROM LONDONFOR THIS HAPPENED IN
THE DAYS OF THE EXTINCT REDWAISTCOATED POLICEWERE ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR
A WEEK OR TWO AND DID PRETTY MUCH WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND READ OF LIKE
AUTHORITIES DOING IN OTHER SUCH CASES THEY TOOK UP SEVERAL OBVIOUSLY
WRONG PEOPLE AND THEY RAN THEIR HEADS VERY HARD AGAINST WRONG IDEAS
AND PERSISTED IN TRYING TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE IDEAS INSTEAD
OF TRYING TO EXTRACT IDEAS FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALSO THEY STOOD
ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE JOLLY BARGEMEN WITH KNOWING AND RESERVED LOOKS
THAT FILLED THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH ADMIRATION AND THEY HAD A
MYSTERIOUS MANNER OF TAKING THEIR DRINK THAT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS
TAKING THE CULPRIT BUT NOT QUITE FOR THEY NEVER DID IT

LONG AFTER THESE CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS HAD DISPERSED MY SISTER LAY
VERY ILL IN BED HER SIGHT WAS DISTURBED SO THAT SHE SAW OBJECTS
MULTIPLIED AND GRASPED AT VISIONARY TEACUPS AND WINEGLASSES INSTEAD OF
THE REALITIES HER HEARING WAS GREATLY IMPAIRED HER MEMORY ALSO AND
HER SPEECH WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE WHEN AT LAST SHE CAME ROUND SO FAR AS
TO BE HELPED DOWNSTAIRS IT WAS STILL NECESSARY TO KEEP MY SLATE ALWAYS
BY HER THAT SHE MIGHT INDICATE IN WRITING WHAT SHE COULD NOT INDICATE
IN SPEECH AS SHE WAS VERY BAD HANDWRITING APART A MORE THAN
INDIFFERENT SPELLER AND AS JOE WAS A MORE THAN INDIFFERENT READER
EXTRAORDINARY COMPLICATIONS AROSE BETWEEN THEM WHICH I WAS ALWAYS
CALLED IN TO SOLVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF MUTTON INSTEAD OF MEDICINE
THE SUBSTITUTION OF TEA FOR JOE AND THE BAKER FOR BACON WERE AMONG
THE MILDEST OF MY OWN MISTAKES

HOWEVER HER TEMPER WAS GREATLY IMPROVED AND SHE WAS PATIENT A
TREMULOUS UNCERTAINTY OF THE ACTION OF ALL HER LIMBS SOON BECAME A PART
OF HER REGULAR STATE AND AFTERWARDS AT INTERVALS OF TWO OR THREE
MONTHS SHE WOULD OFTEN PUT HER HANDS TO HER HEAD AND WOULD THEN
REMAIN FOR ABOUT A WEEK AT A TIME IN SOME GLOOMY ABERRATION OF MIND WE
WERE AT A LOSS TO FIND A SUITABLE ATTENDANT FOR HER UNTIL A
CIRCUMSTANCE HAPPENED CONVENIENTLY TO RELIEVE US MR WOPSLES
GREATAUNT CONQUERED A CONFIRMED HABIT OF LIVING INTO WHICH SHE HAD
FALLEN AND BIDDY BECAME A PART OF OUR ESTABLISHMENT

IT MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT A MONTH AFTER MY SISTERS REAPPEARANCE IN THE
KITCHEN WHEN BIDDY CAME TO US WITH A SMALL SPECKLED BOX CONTAINING THE
WHOLE OF HER WORLDLY EFFECTS AND BECAME A BLESSING TO THE HOUSEHOLD
ABOVE ALL SHE WAS A BLESSING TO JOE FOR THE DEAR OLD FELLOW WAS SADLY
CUT UP BY THE CONSTANT CONTEMPLATION OF THE WRECK OF HIS WIFE AND HAD
BEEN ACCUSTOMED WHILE ATTENDING ON HER OF AN EVENING TO TURN TO ME
EVERY NOW AND THEN AND SAY WITH HIS BLUE EYES MOISTENED SUCH A FINE
FIGURE OF A WOMAN AS SHE ONCE WERE PIP BIDDY INSTANTLY TAKING THE
CLEVEREST CHARGE OF HER AS THOUGH SHE HAD STUDIED HER FROM INFANCY JOE
BECAME ABLE IN SOME SORT TO APPRECIATE THE GREATER QUIET OF HIS LIFE
AND TO GET DOWN TO THE JOLLY BARGEMEN NOW AND THEN FOR A CHANGE THAT
DID HIM GOOD IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE POLICE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD
ALL MORE OR LESS SUSPECTED POOR JOE THOUGH HE NEVER KNEW IT AND THAT
THEY HAD TO A MAN CONCURRED IN REGARDING HIM AS ONE OF THE DEEPEST
SPIRITS THEY HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED

BIDDYS FIRST TRIUMPH IN HER NEW OFFICE WAS TO SOLVE A DIFFICULTY THAT
HAD COMPLETELY VANQUISHED ME I HAD TRIED HARD AT IT BUT HAD MADE
NOTHING OF IT THUS IT WAS

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN MY SISTER HAD TRACED UPON THE SLATE A
CHARACTER THAT LOOKED LIKE A CURIOUS T AND THEN WITH THE UTMOST
EAGERNESS HAD CALLED OUR ATTENTION TO IT AS SOMETHING SHE PARTICULARLY
WANTED I HAD IN VAIN TRIED EVERYTHING PRODUCIBLE THAT BEGAN WITH A T
FROM TAR TO TOAST AND TUB AT LENGTH IT HAD COME INTO MY HEAD THAT THE
SIGN LOOKED LIKE A HAMMER AND ON MY LUSTILY CALLING THAT WORD IN MY
SISTERS EAR SHE HAD BEGUN TO HAMMER ON THE TABLE AND HAD EXPRESSED A
QUALIFIED ASSENT THEREUPON I HAD BROUGHT IN ALL OUR HAMMERS ONE
AFTER ANOTHER BUT WITHOUT AVAIL THEN I BETHOUGHT ME OF A CRUTCH THE
SHAPE BEING MUCH THE SAME AND I BORROWED ONE IN THE VILLAGE AND
DISPLAYED IT TO MY SISTER WITH CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE BUT SHE SHOOK
HER HEAD TO THAT EXTENT WHEN SHE WAS SHOWN IT THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED
LEST IN HER WEAK AND SHATTERED STATE SHE SHOULD DISLOCATE HER NECK

WHEN MY SISTER FOUND THAT BIDDY WAS VERY QUICK TO UNDERSTAND HER THIS
MYSTERIOUS SIGN REAPPEARED ON THE SLATE BIDDY LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT
IT HEARD MY EXPLANATION LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT MY SISTER LOOKED
THOUGHTFULLY AT JOE WHO WAS ALWAYS REPRESENTED ON THE SLATE BY HIS
INITIAL LETTER AND RAN INTO THE FORGE FOLLOWED BY JOE AND ME

WHY OF COURSE CRIED BIDDY WITH AN EXULTANT FACE DONT YOU SEE
ITS HIM

ORLICK WITHOUT A DOUBT SHE HAD LOST HIS NAME AND COULD ONLY SIGNIFY
HIM BY HIS HAMMER WE TOLD HIM WHY WE WANTED HIM TO COME INTO THE
KITCHEN AND HE SLOWLY LAID DOWN HIS HAMMER WIPED HIS BROW WITH HIS
ARM TOOK ANOTHER WIPE AT IT WITH HIS APRON AND CAME SLOUCHING OUT
WITH A CURIOUS LOOSE VAGABOND BEND IN THE KNEES THAT STRONGLY
DISTINGUISHED HIM

I CONFESS THAT I EXPECTED TO SEE MY SISTER DENOUNCE HIM AND THAT I WAS
DISAPPOINTED BY THE DIFFERENT RESULT SHE MANIFESTED THE GREATEST
ANXIETY TO BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM WAS EVIDENTLY MUCH PLEASED BY HIS
BEING AT LENGTH PRODUCED AND MOTIONED THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HIM GIVEN
SOMETHING TO DRINK SHE WATCHED HIS COUNTENANCE AS IF SHE WERE
PARTICULARLY WISHFUL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE TOOK KINDLY TO HIS
RECEPTION SHE SHOWED EVERY POSSIBLE DESIRE TO CONCILIATE HIM AND
THERE WAS AN AIR OF HUMBLE PROPITIATION IN ALL SHE DID SUCH AS I HAVE
SEEN PERVADE THE BEARING OF A CHILD TOWARDS A HARD MASTER AFTER THAT
DAY A DAY RARELY PASSED WITHOUT HER DRAWING THE HAMMER ON HER SLATE
AND WITHOUT ORLICKS SLOUCHING IN AND STANDING DOGGEDLY BEFORE HER AS
IF HE KNEW NO MORE THAN I DID WHAT TO MAKE OF IT




CHAPTER XVII


I NOW FELL INTO A REGULAR ROUTINE OF APPRENTICESHIP LIFE WHICH WAS
VARIED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE VILLAGE AND THE MARSHES BY NO MORE
REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAN THE ARRIVAL OF MY BIRTHDAY AND MY PAYING
ANOTHER VISIT TO MISS HAVISHAM I FOUND MISS SARAH POCKET STILL ON DUTY
AT THE GATE I FOUND MISS HAVISHAM JUST AS I HAD LEFT HER AND SHE
SPOKE OF ESTELLA IN THE VERY SAME WAY IF NOT IN THE VERY SAME WORDS
THE INTERVIEW LASTED BUT A FEW MINUTES AND SHE GAVE ME A GUINEA WHEN I
WAS GOING AND TOLD ME TO COME AGAIN ON MY NEXT BIRTHDAY I MAY MENTION
AT ONCE THAT THIS BECAME AN ANNUAL CUSTOM I TRIED TO DECLINE TAKING
THE GUINEA ON THE FIRST OCCASION BUT WITH NO BETTER EFFECT THAN
CAUSING HER TO ASK ME VERY ANGRILY IF I EXPECTED MORE THEN AND AFTER
THAT I TOOK IT

SO UNCHANGING WAS THE DULL OLD HOUSE THE YELLOW LIGHT IN THE DARKENED
ROOM THE FADED SPECTRE IN THE CHAIR BY THE DRESSINGTABLE GLASS THAT
I FELT AS IF THE STOPPING OF THE CLOCKS HAD STOPPED TIME IN THAT
MYSTERIOUS PLACE AND WHILE I AND EVERYTHING ELSE OUTSIDE IT GREW
OLDER IT STOOD STILL DAYLIGHT NEVER ENTERED THE HOUSE AS TO MY
THOUGHTS AND REMEMBRANCES OF IT ANY MORE THAN AS TO THE ACTUAL FACT
IT BEWILDERED ME AND UNDER ITS INFLUENCE I CONTINUED AT HEART TO HATE
MY TRADE AND TO BE ASHAMED OF HOME

IMPERCEPTIBLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A CHANGE IN BIDDY HOWEVER HER
SHOES CAME UP AT THE HEEL HER HAIR GREW BRIGHT AND NEAT HER HANDS
WERE ALWAYS CLEAN SHE WAS NOT BEAUTIFULSHE WAS COMMON AND COULD NOT
BE LIKE ESTELLABUT SHE WAS PLEASANT AND WHOLESOME AND SWEETTEMPERED
SHE HAD NOT BEEN WITH US MORE THAN A YEAR I REMEMBER HER BEING NEWLY
OUT OF MOURNING AT THE TIME IT STRUCK ME WHEN I OBSERVED TO MYSELF
ONE EVENING THAT SHE HAD CURIOUSLY THOUGHTFUL AND ATTENTIVE EYES EYES
THAT WERE VERY PRETTY AND VERY GOOD

IT CAME OF MY LIFTING UP MY OWN EYES FROM A TASK I WAS PORING
ATWRITING SOME PASSAGES FROM A BOOK TO IMPROVE MYSELF IN TWO WAYS AT
ONCE BY A SORT OF STRATAGEMAND SEEING BIDDY OBSERVANT OF WHAT I WAS
ABOUT I LAID DOWN MY PEN AND BIDDY STOPPED IN HER NEEDLEWORK WITHOUT
LAYING IT DOWN

BIDDY SAID I HOW DO YOU MANAGE IT EITHER I AM VERY STUPID OR YOU
ARE VERY CLEVER

WHAT IS IT THAT I MANAGE I DONT KNOW RETURNED BIDDY SMILING

SHE MANAGED OUR WHOLE DOMESTIC LIFE AND WONDERFULLY TOO BUT I DID NOT
MEAN THAT THOUGH THAT MADE WHAT I DID MEAN MORE SURPRISING

HOW DO YOU MANAGE BIDDY SAID I TO LEARN EVERYTHING THAT I LEARN
AND ALWAYS TO KEEP UP WITH ME I WAS BEGINNING TO BE RATHER VAIN OF MY
KNOWLEDGE FOR I SPENT MY BIRTHDAY GUINEAS ON IT AND SET ASIDE THE
GREATER PART OF MY POCKETMONEY FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT THOUGH I HAVE
NO DOUBT NOW THAT THE LITTLE I KNEW WAS EXTREMELY DEAR AT THE PRICE

I MIGHT AS WELL ASK YOU SAID BIDDY HOW YOU MANAGE

NO BECAUSE WHEN I COME IN FROM THE FORGE OF A NIGHT ANY ONE CAN SEE
ME TURNING TO AT IT BUT YOU NEVER TURN TO AT IT BIDDY

I SUPPOSE I MUST CATCH IT LIKE A COUGH SAID BIDDY QUIETLY AND WENT
ON WITH HER SEWING

PURSUING MY IDEA AS I LEANED BACK IN MY WOODEN CHAIR AND LOOKED AT
BIDDY SEWING AWAY WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE I BEGAN TO THINK HER
RATHER AN EXTRAORDINARY GIRL FOR I CALLED TO MIND NOW THAT SHE WAS
EQUALLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE TERMS OF OUR TRADE AND THE NAMES OF OUR
DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK AND OUR VARIOUS TOOLS IN SHORT WHATEVER I
KNEW BIDDY KNEW THEORETICALLY SHE WAS ALREADY AS GOOD A BLACKSMITH
AS I OR BETTER

YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE BIDDY SAID I WHO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY
CHANCE YOU NEVER HAD A CHANCE BEFORE YOU CAME HERE AND SEE HOW
IMPROVED YOU ARE

BIDDY LOOKED AT ME FOR AN INSTANT AND WENT ON WITH HER SEWING I WAS
YOUR FIRST TEACHER THOUGH WASNT I SAID SHE AS SHE SEWED

BIDDY I EXCLAIMED IN AMAZEMENT WHY YOU ARE CRYING

NO I AM NOT SAID BIDDY LOOKING UP AND LAUGHING WHAT PUT THAT IN
YOUR HEAD

WHAT COULD HAVE PUT IT IN MY HEAD BUT THE GLISTENING OF A TEAR AS IT
DROPPED ON HER WORK I SAT SILENT RECALLING WHAT A DRUDGE SHE HAD BEEN
UNTIL MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT SUCCESSFULLY OVERCAME THAT BAD HABIT OF
LIVING SO HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO BE GOT RID OF BY SOME PEOPLE I RECALLED
THE HOPELESS CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SURROUNDED IN THE
MISERABLE LITTLE SHOP AND THE MISERABLE LITTLE NOISY EVENING SCHOOL
WITH THAT MISERABLE OLD BUNDLE OF INCOMPETENCE ALWAYS TO BE DRAGGED AND
SHOULDERED I REFLECTED THAT EVEN IN THOSE UNTOWARD TIMES THERE MUST
HAVE BEEN LATENT IN BIDDY WHAT WAS NOW DEVELOPING FOR IN MY FIRST
UNEASINESS AND DISCONTENT I HAD TURNED TO HER FOR HELP AS A MATTER OF
COURSE BIDDY SAT QUIETLY SEWING SHEDDING NO MORE TEARS AND WHILE I
LOOKED AT HER AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT PERHAPS
I HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY GRATEFUL TO BIDDY I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO
RESERVED AND SHOULD HAVE PATRONISED HER MORE THOUGH I DID NOT USE
THAT PRECISE WORD IN MY MEDITATIONS WITH MY CONFIDENCE

YES BIDDY I OBSERVED WHEN I HAD DONE TURNING IT OVER YOU WERE MY
FIRST TEACHER AND THAT AT A TIME WHEN WE LITTLE THOUGHT OF EVER BEING
TOGETHER LIKE THIS IN THIS KITCHEN

AH POOR THING REPLIED BIDDY IT WAS LIKE HER SELFFORGETFULNESS TO
TRANSFER THE REMARK TO MY SISTER AND TO GET UP AND BE BUSY ABOUT HER
MAKING HER MORE COMFORTABLE THATS SADLY TRUE

WELL SAID I WE MUST TALK TOGETHER A LITTLE MORE AS WE USED TO DO
AND I MUST CONSULT YOU A LITTLE MORE AS I USED TO DO LET US HAVE A
QUIET WALK ON THE MARSHES NEXT SUNDAY BIDDY AND A LONG CHAT

MY SISTER WAS NEVER LEFT ALONE NOW BUT JOE MORE THAN READILY UNDERTOOK
THE CARE OF HER ON THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND BIDDY AND I WENT OUT
TOGETHER IT WAS SUMMERTIME AND LOVELY WEATHER WHEN WE HAD PASSED
THE VILLAGE AND THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCHYARD AND WERE OUT ON THE
MARSHES AND BEGAN TO SEE THE SAILS OF THE SHIPS AS THEY SAILED ON I
BEGAN TO COMBINE MISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA WITH THE PROSPECT IN MY
USUAL WAY WHEN WE CAME TO THE RIVERSIDE AND SAT DOWN ON THE BANK
WITH THE WATER RIPPLING AT OUR FEET MAKING IT ALL MORE QUIET THAN IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THAT SOUND I RESOLVED THAT IT WAS A GOOD TIME
AND PLACE FOR THE ADMISSION OF BIDDY INTO MY INNER CONFIDENCE

BIDDY SAID I AFTER BINDING HER TO SECRECY I WANT TO BE A
GENTLEMAN

O I WOULDNT IF I WAS YOU SHE RETURNED I DONT THINK IT WOULD
ANSWER

BIDDY SAID I WITH SOME SEVERITY I HAVE PARTICULAR REASONS FOR
WANTING TO BE A GENTLEMAN

YOU KNOW BEST PIP BUT DONT YOU THINK YOU ARE HAPPIER AS YOU ARE

BIDDY I EXCLAIMED IMPATIENTLY I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY AS I AM I AM
DISGUSTED WITH MY CALLING AND WITH MY LIFE I HAVE NEVER TAKEN TO
EITHER SINCE I WAS BOUND DONT BE ABSURD

WAS I ABSURD SAID BIDDY QUIETLY RAISING HER EYEBROWS I AM SORRY
FOR THAT I DIDNT MEAN TO BE I ONLY WANT YOU TO DO WELL AND TO BE
COMFORTABLE

WELL THEN UNDERSTAND ONCE FOR ALL THAT I NEVER SHALL OR CAN BE
COMFORTABLEOR ANYTHING BUT MISERABLETHERE BIDDYUNLESS I CAN LEAD A
VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF LIFE FROM THE LIFE I LEAD NOW

THATS A PITY SAID BIDDY SHAKING HER HEAD WITH A SORROWFUL AIR

NOW I TOO HAD SO OFTEN THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT IN THE SINGULAR KIND
OF QUARREL WITH MYSELF WHICH I WAS ALWAYS CARRYING ON I WAS HALF
INCLINED TO SHED TEARS OF VEXATION AND DISTRESS WHEN BIDDY GAVE
UTTERANCE TO HER SENTIMENT AND MY OWN I TOLD HER SHE WAS RIGHT AND I
KNEW IT WAS MUCH TO BE REGRETTED BUT STILL IT WAS NOT TO BE HELPED

IF I COULD HAVE SETTLED DOWN I SAID TO BIDDY PLUCKING UP THE SHORT
GRASS WITHIN REACH MUCH AS I HAD ONCE UPON A TIME PULLED MY FEELINGS
OUT OF MY HAIR AND KICKED THEM INTO THE BREWERY WALLIF I COULD HAVE
SETTLED DOWN AND BEEN BUT HALF AS FOND OF THE FORGE AS I WAS WHEN I WAS
LITTLE I KNOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER FOR ME YOU AND I AND JOE
WOULD HAVE WANTED NOTHING THEN AND JOE AND I WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GONE
PARTNERS WHEN I WAS OUT OF MY TIME AND I MIGHT EVEN HAVE GROWN UP TO
KEEP COMPANY WITH YOU AND WE MIGHT HAVE SAT ON THIS VERY BANK ON A
FINE SUNDAY QUITE DIFFERENT PEOPLE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH FOR
YOU SHOULDNT I BIDDY

BIDDY SIGHED AS SHE LOOKED AT THE SHIPS SAILING ON AND RETURNED FOR
ANSWER YES I AM NOT OVERPARTICULAR IT SCARCELY SOUNDED
FLATTERING BUT I KNEW SHE MEANT WELL

INSTEAD OF THAT SAID I PLUCKING UP MORE GRASS AND CHEWING A BLADE
OR TWO SEE HOW I AM GOING ON DISSATISFIED AND UNCOMFORTABLE
ANDWHAT WOULD IT SIGNIFY TO ME BEING COARSE AND COMMON IF NOBODY HAD
TOLD ME SO

BIDDY TURNED HER FACE SUDDENLY TOWARDS MINE AND LOOKED FAR MORE
ATTENTIVELY AT ME THAN SHE HAD LOOKED AT THE SAILING SHIPS

IT WAS NEITHER A VERY TRUE NOR A VERY POLITE THING TO SAY SHE
REMARKED DIRECTING HER EYES TO THE SHIPS AGAIN WHO SAID IT

I WAS DISCONCERTED FOR I HAD BROKEN AWAY WITHOUT QUITE SEEING WHERE I
WAS GOING TO IT WAS NOT TO BE SHUFFLED OFF NOW HOWEVER AND I
ANSWERED THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY AT MISS HAVISHAMS AND SHES MORE
BEAUTIFUL THAN ANYBODY EVER WAS AND I ADMIRE HER DREADFULLY AND I
WANT TO BE A GENTLEMAN ON HER ACCOUNT HAVING MADE THIS LUNATIC
CONFESSION I BEGAN TO THROW MY TORNUP GRASS INTO THE RIVER AS IF I
HAD SOME THOUGHTS OF FOLLOWING IT

DO YOU WANT TO BE A GENTLEMAN TO SPITE HER OR TO GAIN HER OVER
BIDDY QUIETLY ASKED ME AFTER A PAUSE

I DONT KNOW I MOODILY ANSWERED

BECAUSE IF IT IS TO SPITE HER BIDDY PURSUED I SHOULD THINKBUT
YOU KNOW BESTTHAT MIGHT BE BETTER AND MORE INDEPENDENTLY DONE BY
CARING NOTHING FOR HER WORDS AND IF IT IS TO GAIN HER OVER I SHOULD
THINKBUT YOU KNOW BESTSHE WAS NOT WORTH GAINING OVER

EXACTLY WHAT I MYSELF HAD THOUGHT MANY TIMES EXACTLY WHAT WAS
PERFECTLY MANIFEST TO ME AT THE MOMENT BUT HOW COULD I A POOR DAZED
VILLAGE LAD AVOID THAT WONDERFUL INCONSISTENCY INTO WHICH THE BEST AND
WISEST OF MEN FALL EVERY DAY

IT MAY BE ALL QUITE TRUE SAID I TO BIDDY BUT I ADMIRE HER
DREADFULLY

IN SHORT I TURNED OVER ON MY FACE WHEN I CAME TO THAT AND GOT A GOOD
GRASP ON THE HAIR ON EACH SIDE OF MY HEAD AND WRENCHED IT WELL ALL
THE WHILE KNOWING THE MADNESS OF MY HEART TO BE SO VERY MAD AND
MISPLACED THAT I WAS QUITE CONSCIOUS IT WOULD HAVE SERVED MY FACE
RIGHT IF I HAD LIFTED IT UP BY MY HAIR AND KNOCKED IT AGAINST THE
PEBBLES AS A PUNISHMENT FOR BELONGING TO SUCH AN IDIOT

BIDDY WAS THE WISEST OF GIRLS AND SHE TRIED TO REASON NO MORE WITH ME
SHE PUT HER HAND WHICH WAS A COMFORTABLE HAND THOUGH ROUGHENED BY
WORK UPON MY HANDS ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND GENTLY TOOK THEM OUT OF MY
HAIR THEN SHE SOFTLY PATTED MY SHOULDER IN A SOOTHING WAY WHILE WITH
MY FACE UPON MY SLEEVE I CRIED A LITTLEEXACTLY AS I HAD DONE IN THE
BREWERY YARDAND FELT VAGUELY CONVINCED THAT I WAS VERY MUCH ILLUSED
BY SOMEBODY OR BY EVERYBODY I CANT SAY WHICH

I AM GLAD OF ONE THING SAID BIDDY AND THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE FELT
YOU COULD GIVE ME YOUR CONFIDENCE PIP AND I AM GLAD OF ANOTHER THING
AND THAT IS THAT OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU MAY DEPEND UPON MY KEEPING IT
AND ALWAYS SO FAR DESERVING IT IF YOUR FIRST TEACHER DEAR SUCH A
POOR ONE AND SO MUCH IN NEED OF BEING TAUGHT HERSELF HAD BEEN YOUR
TEACHER AT THE PRESENT TIME SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS WHAT LESSON SHE WOULD
SET BUT IT WOULD BE A HARD ONE TO LEARN AND YOU HAVE GOT BEYOND HER
AND ITS OF NO USE NOW SO WITH A QUIET SIGH FOR ME BIDDY ROSE FROM
THE BANK AND SAID WITH A FRESH AND PLEASANT CHANGE OF VOICE SHALL
WE WALK A LITTLE FARTHER OR GO HOME

BIDDY I CRIED GETTING UP PUTTING MY ARM ROUND HER NECK AND GIVING
HER A KISS I SHALL ALWAYS TELL YOU EVERYTHING

TILL YOURE A GENTLEMAN SAID BIDDY

YOU KNOW I NEVER SHALL BE SO THATS ALWAYS NOT THAT I HAVE ANY
OCCASION TO TELL YOU ANYTHING FOR YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I KNOWAS I
TOLD YOU AT HOME THE OTHER NIGHT

AH SAID BIDDY QUITE IN A WHISPER AS SHE LOOKED AWAY AT THE SHIPS
AND THEN REPEATED WITH HER FORMER PLEASANT CHANGE SHALL WE WALK A
LITTLE FARTHER OR GO HOME

I SAID TO BIDDY WE WOULD WALK A LITTLE FARTHER AND WE DID SO AND THE
SUMMER AFTERNOON TONED DOWN INTO THE SUMMER EVENING AND IT WAS VERY
BEAUTIFUL I BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER I WAS NOT MORE NATURALLY AND
WHOLESOMELY SITUATED AFTER ALL IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAN PLAYING
BEGGAR MY NEIGHBOUR BY CANDLELIGHT IN THE ROOM WITH THE STOPPED
CLOCKS AND BEING DESPISED BY ESTELLA I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD
FOR ME IF I COULD GET HER OUT OF MY HEAD WITH ALL THE REST OF THOSE
REMEMBRANCES AND FANCIES AND COULD GO TO WORK DETERMINED TO RELISH
WHAT I HAD TO DO AND STICK TO IT AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT I ASKED
MYSELF THE QUESTION WHETHER I DID NOT SURELY KNOW THAT IF ESTELLA WERE
BESIDE ME AT THAT MOMENT INSTEAD OF BIDDY SHE WOULD MAKE ME MISERABLE
I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT I DID KNOW IT FOR A CERTAINTY AND I SAID
TO MYSELF PIP WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE

WE TALKED A GOOD DEAL AS WE WALKED AND ALL THAT BIDDY SAID SEEMED
RIGHT BIDDY WAS NEVER INSULTING OR CAPRICIOUS OR BIDDY TODAY AND
SOMEBODY ELSE TOMORROW SHE WOULD HAVE DERIVED ONLY PAIN AND NO
PLEASURE FROM GIVING ME PAIN SHE WOULD FAR RATHER HAVE WOUNDED HER
OWN BREAST THAN MINE HOW COULD IT BE THEN THAT I DID NOT LIKE HER
MUCH THE BETTER OF THE TWO

BIDDY SAID I WHEN WE WERE WALKING HOMEWARD I WISH YOU COULD PUT
ME RIGHT

I WISH I COULD SAID BIDDY

IF I COULD ONLY GET MYSELF TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUYOU DONT MIND MY
SPEAKING SO OPENLY TO SUCH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE

OH DEAR NOT AT ALL SAID BIDDY DONT MIND ME

IF I COULD ONLY GET MYSELF TO DO IT THAT WOULD BE THE THING FOR
ME

BUT YOU NEVER WILL YOU SEE SAID BIDDY

IT DID NOT APPEAR QUITE SO UNLIKELY TO ME THAT EVENING AS IT WOULD
HAVE DONE IF WE HAD DISCUSSED IT A FEW HOURS BEFORE I THEREFORE
OBSERVED I WAS NOT QUITE SURE OF THAT BUT BIDDY SAID SHE WAS AND
SHE SAID IT DECISIVELY IN MY HEART I BELIEVED HER TO BE RIGHT AND YET
I TOOK IT RATHER ILL TOO THAT SHE SHOULD BE SO POSITIVE ON THE POINT

WHEN WE CAME NEAR THE CHURCHYARD WE HAD TO CROSS AN EMBANKMENT AND
GET OVER A STILE NEAR A SLUICEGATE THERE STARTED UP FROM THE GATE
OR FROM THE RUSHES OR FROM THE OOZE WHICH WAS QUITE IN HIS STAGNANT
WAY OLD ORLICK

HALLOA HE GROWLED WHERE ARE YOU TWO GOING

WHERE SHOULD WE BE GOING BUT HOME

WELL THEN SAID HE IM JIGGERED IF I DONT SEE YOU HOME

THIS PENALTY OF BEING JIGGERED WAS A FAVOURITE SUPPOSITITIOUS CASE OF
HIS HE ATTACHED NO DEFINITE MEANING TO THE WORD THAT I AM AWARE OF
BUT USED IT LIKE HIS OWN PRETENDED CHRISTIAN NAME TO AFFRONT MANKIND
AND CONVEY AN IDEA OF SOMETHING SAVAGELY DAMAGING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
I HAD HAD A GENERAL BELIEF THAT IF HE HAD JIGGERED ME PERSONALLY HE
WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH A SHARP AND TWISTED HOOK

BIDDY WAS MUCH AGAINST HIS GOING WITH US AND SAID TO ME IN A WHISPER
DONT LET HIM COME I DONT LIKE HIM AS I DID NOT LIKE HIM EITHER I
TOOK THE LIBERTY OF SAYING THAT WE THANKED HIM BUT WE DIDNT WANT
SEEING HOME HE RECEIVED THAT PIECE OF INFORMATION WITH A YELL OF
LAUGHTER AND DROPPED BACK BUT CAME SLOUCHING AFTER US AT A LITTLE
DISTANCE

CURIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER BIDDY SUSPECTED HIM OF HAVING HAD A HAND IN
THAT MURDEROUS ATTACK OF WHICH MY SISTER HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GIVE
ANY ACCOUNT I ASKED HER WHY SHE DID NOT LIKE HIM

OH SHE REPLIED GLANCING OVER HER SHOULDER AS HE SLOUCHED AFTER US
BECAUSE II AM AFRAID HE LIKES ME

DID HE EVER TELL YOU HE LIKED YOU I ASKED INDIGNANTLY

NO SAID BIDDY GLANCING OVER HER SHOULDER AGAIN HE NEVER TOLD ME
SO BUT HE DANCES AT ME WHENEVER HE CAN CATCH MY EYE

HOWEVER NOVEL AND PECULIAR THIS TESTIMONY OF ATTACHMENT I DID NOT
DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THE INTERPRETATION I WAS VERY HOT INDEED UPON
OLD ORLICKS DARING TO ADMIRE HER AS HOT AS IF IT WERE AN OUTRAGE ON
MYSELF

BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU YOU KNOW SAID BIDDY CALMLY

NO BIDDY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME ONLY I DONT LIKE IT I DONT
APPROVE OF IT

NOR I NEITHER SAID BIDDY THOUGH THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO
YOU

EXACTLY SAID I BUT I MUST TELL YOU I SHOULD HAVE NO OPINION OF
YOU BIDDY IF HE DANCED AT YOU WITH YOUR OWN CONSENT

I KEPT AN EYE ON ORLICK AFTER THAT NIGHT AND WHENEVER CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE FAVOURABLE TO HIS DANCING AT BIDDY GOT BEFORE HIM TO OBSCURE THAT
DEMONSTRATION HE HAD STRUCK ROOT IN JOES ESTABLISHMENT BY REASON OF
MY SISTERS SUDDEN FANCY FOR HIM OR I SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO GET HIM
DISMISSED HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD AND RECIPROCATED MY GOOD INTENTIONS AS
I HAD REASON TO KNOW THEREAFTER

AND NOW BECAUSE MY MIND WAS NOT CONFUSED ENOUGH BEFORE I COMPLICATED
ITS CONFUSION FIFTY THOUSANDFOLD BY HAVING STATES AND SEASONS WHEN I
WAS CLEAR THAT BIDDY WAS IMMEASURABLY BETTER THAN ESTELLA AND THAT THE
PLAIN HONEST WORKING LIFE TO WHICH I WAS BORN HAD NOTHING IN IT TO BE
ASHAMED OF BUT OFFERED ME SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SELFRESPECT AND
HAPPINESS AT THOSE TIMES I WOULD DECIDE CONCLUSIVELY THAT MY
DISAFFECTION TO DEAR OLD JOE AND THE FORGE WAS GONE AND THAT I WAS
GROWING UP IN A FAIR WAY TO BE PARTNERS WITH JOE AND TO KEEP COMPANY
WITH BIDDYWHEN ALL IN A MOMENT SOME CONFOUNDING REMEMBRANCE OF THE
HAVISHAM DAYS WOULD FALL UPON ME LIKE A DESTRUCTIVE MISSILE AND
SCATTER MY WITS AGAIN SCATTERED WITS TAKE A LONG TIME PICKING UP AND
OFTEN BEFORE I HAD GOT THEM WELL TOGETHER THEY WOULD BE DISPERSED IN
ALL DIRECTIONS BY ONE STRAY THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS AFTER ALL MISS
HAVISHAM WAS GOING TO MAKE MY FORTUNE WHEN MY TIME WAS OUT

IF MY TIME HAD RUN OUT IT WOULD HAVE LEFT ME STILL AT THE HEIGHT OF MY
PERPLEXITIES I DARE SAY IT NEVER DID RUN OUT HOWEVER BUT WAS
BROUGHT TO A PREMATURE END AS I PROCEED TO RELATE




CHAPTER XVIII


IT WAS IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF MY APPRENTICESHIP TO JOE AND IT WAS A
SATURDAY NIGHT THERE WAS A GROUP ASSEMBLED ROUND THE FIRE AT THE THREE
JOLLY BARGEMEN ATTENTIVE TO MR WOPSLE AS HE READ THE NEWSPAPER ALOUD
OF THAT GROUP I WAS ONE

A HIGHLY POPULAR MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND MR WOPSLE WAS IMBRUED
IN BLOOD TO THE EYEBROWS HE GLOATED OVER EVERY ABHORRENT ADJECTIVE IN
THE DESCRIPTION AND IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH EVERY WITNESS AT THE
INQUEST HE FAINTLY MOANED I AM DONE FOR AS THE VICTIM AND HE
BARBAROUSLY BELLOWED ILL SERVE YOU OUT AS THE MURDERER HE GAVE
THE MEDICAL TESTIMONY IN POINTED IMITATION OF OUR LOCAL PRACTITIONER
AND HE PIPED AND SHOOK AS THE AGED TURNPIKEKEEPER WHO HAD HEARD
BLOWS TO AN EXTENT SO VERY PARALYTIC AS TO SUGGEST A DOUBT REGARDING
THE MENTAL COMPETENCY OF THAT WITNESS THE CORONER IN MR WOPSLES
HANDS BECAME TIMON OF ATHENS THE BEADLE CORIOLANUS HE ENJOYED
HIMSELF THOROUGHLY AND WE ALL ENJOYED OURSELVES AND WERE DELIGHTFULLY
COMFORTABLE IN THIS COSEY STATE OF MIND WE CAME TO THE VERDICT WILFUL
MURDER

THEN AND NOT SOONER I BECAME AWARE OF A STRANGE GENTLEMAN LEANING
OVER THE BACK OF THE SETTLE OPPOSITE ME LOOKING ON THERE WAS AN
EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT ON HIS FACE AND HE BIT THE SIDE OF A GREAT
FOREFINGER AS HE WATCHED THE GROUP OF FACES

WELL SAID THE STRANGER TO MR WOPSLE WHEN THE READING WAS DONE
YOU HAVE SETTLED IT ALL TO YOUR OWN SATISFACTION I HAVE NO DOUBT

EVERYBODY STARTED AND LOOKED UP AS IF IT WERE THE MURDERER HE LOOKED
AT EVERYBODY COLDLY AND SARCASTICALLY

GUILTY OF COURSE SAID HE OUT WITH IT COME

SIR RETURNED MR WOPSLE WITHOUT HAVING THE HONOUR OF YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE I DO SAY GUILTY UPON THIS WE ALL TOOK COURAGE TO UNITE
IN A CONFIRMATORY MURMUR

I KNOW YOU DO SAID THE STRANGER I KNEW YOU WOULD I TOLD YOU SO
BUT NOW ILL ASK YOU A QUESTION DO YOU KNOW OR DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT
THE LAW OF ENGLAND SUPPOSES EVERY MAN TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL HE IS
PROVEDPROVEDTO BE GUILTY

SIR MR WOPSLE BEGAN TO REPLY AS AN ENGLISHMAN MYSELF I

COME SAID THE STRANGER BITING HIS FOREFINGER AT HIM DONT EVADE
THE QUESTION EITHER YOU KNOW IT OR YOU DONT KNOW IT WHICH IS IT TO
BE

HE STOOD WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIMSELF ON ONE SIDE IN A
BULLYING INTERROGATIVE MANNER AND HE THREW HIS FOREFINGER AT MR
WOPSLEAS IT WERE TO MARK HIM OUTBEFORE BITING IT AGAIN

NOW SAID HE DO YOU KNOW IT OR DONT YOU KNOW IT

CERTAINLY I KNOW IT REPLIED MR WOPSLE

CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT THEN WHY DIDNT YOU SAY SO AT FIRST NOW ILL
ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTIONTAKING POSSESSION OF MR WOPSLE AS IF HE
HAD A RIGHT TO HIMDO YOU KNOW THAT NONE OF THESE WITNESSES HAVE
YET BEEN CROSSEXAMINED

MR WOPSLE WAS BEGINNING I CAN ONLY SAY WHEN THE STRANGER STOPPED
HIM

WHAT YOU WONT ANSWER THE QUESTION YES OR NO NOW ILL TRY YOU
AGAIN THROWING HIS FINGER AT HIM AGAIN ATTEND TO ME ARE YOU AWARE
OR ARE YOU NOT AWARE THAT NONE OF THESE WITNESSES HAVE YET BEEN
CROSSEXAMINED COME I ONLY WANT ONE WORD FROM YOU YES OR NO

MR WOPSLE HESITATED AND WE ALL BEGAN TO CONCEIVE RATHER A POOR
OPINION OF HIM

COME SAID THE STRANGER ILL HELP YOU YOU DONT DESERVE HELP BUT
ILL HELP YOU LOOK AT THAT PAPER YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND WHAT IS IT

WHAT IS IT REPEATED MR WOPSLE EYEING IT MUCH AT A LOSS

IS IT PURSUED THE STRANGER IN HIS MOST SARCASTIC AND SUSPICIOUS
MANNER THE PRINTED PAPER YOU HAVE JUST BEEN READING FROM

UNDOUBTEDLY

UNDOUBTEDLY NOW TURN TO THAT PAPER AND TELL ME WHETHER IT
DISTINCTLY STATES THAT THE PRISONER EXPRESSLY SAID THAT HIS LEGAL
ADVISERS INSTRUCTED HIM ALTOGETHER TO RESERVE HIS DEFENCE

I READ THAT JUST NOW MR WOPSLE PLEADED

NEVER MIND WHAT YOU READ JUST NOW SIR I DONT ASK YOU WHAT YOU READ
JUST NOW YOU MAY READ THE LORDS PRAYER BACKWARDS IF YOU LIKEAND
PERHAPS HAVE DONE IT BEFORE TODAY TURN TO THE PAPER NO NO NO MY
FRIEND NOT TO THE TOP OF THE COLUMN YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT TO THE
BOTTOM TO THE BOTTOM WE ALL BEGAN TO THINK MR WOPSLE FULL OF
SUBTERFUGE WELL HAVE YOU FOUND IT

HERE IT IS SAID MR WOPSLE

NOW FOLLOW THAT PASSAGE WITH YOUR EYE AND TELL ME WHETHER IT
DISTINCTLY STATES THAT THE PRISONER EXPRESSLY SAID THAT HE WAS
INSTRUCTED BY HIS LEGAL ADVISERS WHOLLY TO RESERVE HIS DEFENCE COME
DO YOU MAKE THAT OF IT

MR WOPSLE ANSWERED THOSE ARE NOT THE EXACT WORDS

NOT THE EXACT WORDS REPEATED THE GENTLEMAN BITTERLY IS THAT THE
EXACT SUBSTANCE

YES SAID MR WOPSLE

YES REPEATED THE STRANGER LOOKING ROUND AT THE REST OF THE COMPANY
WITH HIS RIGHT HAND EXTENDED TOWARDS THE WITNESS WOPSLE AND NOW I
ASK YOU WHAT YOU SAY TO THE CONSCIENCE OF THAT MAN WHO WITH THAT
PASSAGE BEFORE HIS EYES CAN LAY HIS HEAD UPON HIS PILLOW AFTER HAVING
PRONOUNCED A FELLOWCREATURE GUILTY UNHEARD

WE ALL BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT MR WOPSLE WAS NOT THE MAN WE HAD THOUGHT
HIM AND THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO BE FOUND OUT

AND THAT SAME MAN REMEMBER PURSUED THE GENTLEMAN THROWING HIS
FINGER AT MR WOPSLE HEAVILYTHAT SAME MAN MIGHT BE SUMMONED AS A
JURYMAN UPON THIS VERY TRIAL AND HAVING THUS DEEPLY COMMITTED
HIMSELF MIGHT RETURN TO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY AND LAY HIS HEAD UPON
HIS PILLOW AFTER DELIBERATELY SWEARING THAT HE WOULD WELL AND TRULY
TRY THE ISSUE JOINED BETWEEN OUR SOVEREIGN LORD THE KING AND THE
PRISONER AT THE BAR AND WOULD A TRUE VERDICT GIVE ACCORDING TO THE
EVIDENCE SO HELP HIM GOD

WE WERE ALL DEEPLY PERSUADED THAT THE UNFORTUNATE WOPSLE HAD GONE TOO
FAR AND HAD BETTER STOP IN HIS RECKLESS CAREER WHILE THERE WAS YET
TIME

THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN WITH AN AIR OF AUTHORITY NOT TO BE DISPUTED AND
WITH A MANNER EXPRESSIVE OF KNOWING SOMETHING SECRET ABOUT EVERY ONE OF
US THAT WOULD EFFECTUALLY DO FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IF HE CHOSE TO
DISCLOSE IT LEFT THE BACK OF THE SETTLE AND CAME INTO THE SPACE
BETWEEN THE TWO SETTLES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WHERE HE REMAINED
STANDING HIS LEFT HAND IN HIS POCKET AND HE BITING THE FOREFINGER OF
HIS RIGHT

FROM INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED SAID HE LOOKING ROUND AT US AS WE
ALL QUAILED BEFORE HIM I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THERE IS A BLACKSMITH
AMONG YOU BY NAME JOSEPHOR JOEGARGERY WHICH IS THE MAN

HERE IS THE MAN SAID JOE

THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN BECKONED HIM OUT OF HIS PLACE AND JOE WENT

YOU HAVE AN APPRENTICE PURSUED THE STRANGER COMMONLY KNOWN AS PIP
IS HE HERE

I AM HERE I CRIED

THE STRANGER DID NOT RECOGNISE ME BUT I RECOGNISED HIM AS THE
GENTLEMAN I HAD MET ON THE STAIRS ON THE OCCASION OF MY SECOND VISIT
TO MISS HAVISHAM I HAD KNOWN HIM THE MOMENT I SAW HIM LOOKING OVER THE
SETTLE AND NOW THAT I STOOD CONFRONTING HIM WITH HIS HAND UPON MY
SHOULDER I CHECKED OFF AGAIN IN DETAIL HIS LARGE HEAD HIS DARK
COMPLEXION HIS DEEPSET EYES HIS BUSHY BLACK EYEBROWS HIS LARGE
WATCHCHAIN HIS STRONG BLACK DOTS OF BEARD AND WHISKER AND EVEN THE
SMELL OF SCENTED SOAP ON HIS GREAT HAND

I WISH TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONFERENCE WITH YOU TWO SAID HE WHEN HE
HAD SURVEYED ME AT HIS LEISURE IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME PERHAPS WE
HAD BETTER GO TO YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE I PREFER NOT TO ANTICIPATE MY
COMMUNICATION HERE YOU WILL IMPART AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE OF IT AS YOU
PLEASE TO YOUR FRIENDS AFTERWARDS I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT

AMIDST A WONDERING SILENCE WE THREE WALKED OUT OF THE JOLLY BARGEMEN
AND IN A WONDERING SILENCE WALKED HOME WHILE GOING ALONG THE STRANGE
GENTLEMAN OCCASIONALLY LOOKED AT ME AND OCCASIONALLY BIT THE SIDE OF
HIS FINGER AS WE NEARED HOME JOE VAGUELY ACKNOWLEDGING THE OCCASION
AS AN IMPRESSIVE AND CEREMONIOUS ONE WENT ON AHEAD TO OPEN THE FRONT
DOOR OUR CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN THE STATE PARLOUR WHICH WAS FEEBLY
LIGHTED BY ONE CANDLE

IT BEGAN WITH THE STRANGE GENTLEMANS SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE
DRAWING THE CANDLE TO HIM AND LOOKING OVER SOME ENTRIES IN HIS
POCKETBOOK HE THEN PUT UP THE POCKETBOOK AND SET THE CANDLE A LITTLE
ASIDE AFTER PEERING ROUND IT INTO THE DARKNESS AT JOE AND ME TO
ASCERTAIN WHICH WAS WHICH

MY NAME HE SAID IS JAGGERS AND I AM A LAWYER IN LONDON I AM
PRETTY WELL KNOWN I HAVE UNUSUAL BUSINESS TO TRANSACT WITH YOU AND I
COMMENCE BY EXPLAINING THAT IT IS NOT OF MY ORIGINATING IF MY ADVICE
HAD BEEN ASKED I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE IT WAS NOT ASKED AND YOU
SEE ME HERE WHAT I HAVE TO DO AS THE CONFIDENTIAL AGENT OF ANOTHER I
DO NO LESS NO MORE

FINDING THAT HE COULD NOT SEE US VERY WELL FROM WHERE HE SAT HE GOT
UP AND THREW ONE LEG OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR AND LEANED UPON IT THUS
HAVING ONE FOOT ON THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR AND ONE FOOT ON THE GROUND

NOW JOSEPH GARGERY I AM THE BEARER OF AN OFFER TO RELIEVE YOU OF
THIS YOUNG FELLOW YOUR APPRENTICE YOU WOULD NOT OBJECT TO CANCEL HIS
INDENTURES AT HIS REQUEST AND FOR HIS GOOD YOU WOULD WANT NOTHING FOR
SO DOING

LORD FORBID THAT I SHOULD WANT ANYTHING FOR NOT STANDING IN PIPS
WAY SAID JOE STARING

LORD FORBIDDING IS PIOUS BUT NOT TO THE PURPOSE RETURNED MR
JAGGERS THE QUESTION IS WOULD YOU WANT ANYTHING DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING

THE ANSWER IS RETURNED JOE STERNLY NO

I THOUGHT MR JAGGERS GLANCED AT JOE AS IF HE CONSIDERED HIM A FOOL
FOR HIS DISINTERESTEDNESS BUT I WAS TOO MUCH BEWILDERED BETWEEN
BREATHLESS CURIOSITY AND SURPRISE TO BE SURE OF IT

VERY WELL SAID MR JAGGERS RECOLLECT THE ADMISSION YOU HAVE MADE
AND DONT TRY TO GO FROM IT PRESENTLY

WHOS AGOING TO TRY RETORTED JOE

I DONT SAY ANYBODY IS DO YOU KEEP A DOG

YES I DO KEEP A DOG

BEAR IN MIND THEN THAT BRAG IS A GOOD DOG BUT HOLDFAST IS A BETTER
BEAR THAT IN MIND WILL YOU REPEATED MR JAGGERS SHUTTING HIS EYES
AND NODDING HIS HEAD AT JOE AS IF HE WERE FORGIVING HIM SOMETHING
NOW I RETURN TO THIS YOUNG FELLOW AND THE COMMUNICATION I HAVE GOT
TO MAKE IS THAT HE HAS GREAT EXPECTATIONS

JOE AND I GASPED AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER

I AM INSTRUCTED TO COMMUNICATE TO HIM SAID MR JAGGERS THROWING HIS
FINGER AT ME SIDEWAYS THAT HE WILL COME INTO A HANDSOME PROPERTY
FURTHER THAT IT IS THE DESIRE OF THE PRESENT POSSESSOR OF THAT
PROPERTY THAT HE BE IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM HIS PRESENT SPHERE OF
LIFE AND FROM THIS PLACE AND BE BROUGHT UP AS A GENTLEMANIN A WORD
AS A YOUNG FELLOW OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS

MY DREAM WAS OUT MY WILD FANCY WAS SURPASSED BY SOBER REALITY MISS
HAVISHAM WAS GOING TO MAKE MY FORTUNE ON A GRAND SCALE

NOW MR PIP PURSUED THE LAWYER I ADDRESS THE REST OF WHAT I HAVE
TO SAY TO YOU YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND FIRST THAT IT IS THE REQUEST OF
THE PERSON FROM WHOM I TAKE MY INSTRUCTIONS THAT YOU ALWAYS BEAR THE
NAME OF PIP YOU WILL HAVE NO OBJECTION I DARE SAY TO YOUR GREAT
EXPECTATIONS BEING ENCUMBERED WITH THAT EASY CONDITION BUT IF YOU HAVE
ANY OBJECTION THIS IS THE TIME TO MENTION IT

MY HEART WAS BEATING SO FAST AND THERE WAS SUCH A SINGING IN MY EARS
THAT I COULD SCARCELY STAMMER I HAD NO OBJECTION

I SHOULD THINK NOT NOW YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND SECONDLY MR PIP THAT
THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO IS YOUR LIBERAL BENEFACTOR REMAINS A
PROFOUND SECRET UNTIL THE PERSON CHOOSES TO REVEAL IT I AM EMPOWERED
TO MENTION THAT IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PERSON TO REVEAL IT AT FIRST
HAND BY WORD OF MOUTH TO YOURSELF WHEN OR WHERE THAT INTENTION MAY BE
CARRIED OUT I CANNOT SAY NO ONE CAN SAY IT MAY BE YEARS HENCE NOW
YOU ARE DISTINCTLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE MOST POSITIVELY
PROHIBITED FROM MAKING ANY INQUIRY ON THIS HEAD OR ANY ALLUSION OR
REFERENCE HOWEVER DISTANT TO ANY INDIVIDUAL WHOMSOEVER AS THE
INDIVIDUAL IN ALL THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU MAY HAVE WITH ME IF YOU HAVE
A SUSPICION IN YOUR OWN BREAST KEEP THAT SUSPICION IN YOUR OWN BREAST
IT IS NOT THE LEAST TO THE PURPOSE WHAT THE REASONS OF THIS PROHIBITION
ARE THEY MAY BE THE STRONGEST AND GRAVEST REASONS OR THEY MAY BE MERE
WHIM THIS IS NOT FOR YOU TO INQUIRE INTO THE CONDITION IS LAID DOWN
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF IT AND YOUR OBSERVANCE OF IT AS BINDING IS THE
ONLY REMAINING CONDITION THAT I AM CHARGED WITH BY THE PERSON FROM
WHOM I TAKE MY INSTRUCTIONS AND FOR WHOM I AM NOT OTHERWISE
RESPONSIBLE THAT PERSON IS THE PERSON FROM WHOM YOU DERIVE YOUR
EXPECTATIONS AND THE SECRET IS SOLELY HELD BY THAT PERSON AND BY ME
AGAIN NOT A VERY DIFFICULT CONDITION WITH WHICH TO ENCUMBER SUCH A
RISE IN FORTUNE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO IT THIS IS THE TIME
TO MENTION IT SPEAK OUT

ONCE MORE I STAMMERED WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I HAD NO OBJECTION

I SHOULD THINK NOT NOW MR PIP I HAVE DONE WITH STIPULATIONS
THOUGH HE CALLED ME MR PIP AND BEGAN RATHER TO MAKE UP TO ME HE
STILL COULD NOT GET RID OF A CERTAIN AIR OF BULLYING SUSPICION AND
EVEN NOW HE OCCASIONALLY SHUT HIS EYES AND THREW HIS FINGER AT ME WHILE
HE SPOKE AS MUCH AS TO EXPRESS THAT HE KNEW ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO MY
DISPARAGEMENT IF HE ONLY CHOSE TO MENTION THEM WE COME NEXT TO MERE
DETAILS OF ARRANGEMENT YOU MUST KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH I HAVE USED THE
TERM EXPECTATIONS MORE THAN ONCE YOU ARE NOT ENDOWED WITH
EXPECTATIONS ONLY THERE IS ALREADY LODGED IN MY HANDS A SUM OF MONEY
AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR YOUR SUITABLE EDUCATION AND MAINTENANCE YOU WILL
PLEASE CONSIDER ME YOUR GUARDIAN OH FOR I WAS GOING TO THANK HIM I
TELL YOU AT ONCE I AM PAID FOR MY SERVICES OR I SHOULDNT RENDER
THEM IT IS CONSIDERED THAT YOU MUST BE BETTER EDUCATED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH YOUR ALTERED POSITION AND THAT YOU WILL BE ALIVE TO THE
IMPORTANCE AND NECESSITY OF AT ONCE ENTERING ON THAT ADVANTAGE

I SAID I HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR IT

NEVER MIND WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS LONGED FOR MR PIP HE RETORTED
KEEP TO THE RECORD IF YOU LONG FOR IT NOW THATS ENOUGH AM I
ANSWERED THAT YOU ARE READY TO BE PLACED AT ONCE UNDER SOME PROPER
TUTOR IS THAT IT

I STAMMERED YES THAT WAS IT

GOOD NOW YOUR INCLINATIONS ARE TO BE CONSULTED I DONT THINK THAT
WISE MIND BUT ITS MY TRUST HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF ANY TUTOR WHOM
YOU WOULD PREFER TO ANOTHER

I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY TUTOR BUT BIDDY AND MR WOPSLES GREATAUNT
SO I REPLIED IN THE NEGATIVE

THERE IS A CERTAIN TUTOR OF WHOM I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE WHO I THINK
MIGHT SUIT THE PURPOSE SAID MR JAGGERS I DONT RECOMMEND HIM
OBSERVE BECAUSE I NEVER RECOMMEND ANYBODY THE GENTLEMAN I SPEAK OF IS
ONE MR MATTHEW POCKET

AH I CAUGHT AT THE NAME DIRECTLY MISS HAVISHAMS RELATION THE
MATTHEW WHOM MR AND MRS CAMILLA HAD SPOKEN OF THE MATTHEW WHOSE
PLACE WAS TO BE AT MISS HAVISHAMS HEAD WHEN SHE LAY DEAD IN HER
BRIDES DRESS ON THE BRIDES TABLE

YOU KNOW THE NAME SAID MR JAGGERS LOOKING SHREWDLY AT ME AND THEN
SHUTTING UP HIS EYES WHILE HE WAITED FOR MY ANSWER

MY ANSWER WAS THAT I HAD HEARD OF THE NAME

OH SAID HE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE NAME BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT
DO YOU SAY OF IT

I SAID OR TRIED TO SAY THAT I WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS
RECOMMENDATION

NO MY YOUNG FRIEND HE INTERRUPTED SHAKING HIS GREAT HEAD VERY
SLOWLY RECOLLECT YOURSELF

NOT RECOLLECTING MYSELF I BEGAN AGAIN THAT I WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM
FOR HIS RECOMMENDATION

NO MY YOUNG FRIEND HE INTERRUPTED SHAKING HIS HEAD AND FROWNING
AND SMILING BOTH AT ONCENO NO NO ITS VERY WELL DONE BUT IT
WONT DO YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO FIX ME WITH IT RECOMMENDATION IS NOT
THE WORD MR PIP TRY ANOTHER

CORRECTING MYSELF I SAID THAT I WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS
MENTION OF MR MATTHEW POCKET

THATS MORE LIKE IT CRIED MR JAGGERSAND I ADDED I WOULD
GLADLY TRY THAT GENTLEMAN

GOOD YOU HAD BETTER TRY HIM IN HIS OWN HOUSE THE WAY SHALL BE
PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOU CAN SEE HIS SON FIRST WHO IS IN LONDON WHEN
WILL YOU COME TO LONDON

I SAID GLANCING AT JOE WHO STOOD LOOKING ON MOTIONLESS THAT I
SUPPOSED I COULD COME DIRECTLY

FIRST SAID MR JAGGERS YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME NEW CLOTHES TO COME
IN AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE WORKINGCLOTHES SAY THIS DAY WEEK YOULL
WANT SOME MONEY SHALL I LEAVE YOU TWENTY GUINEAS

HE PRODUCED A LONG PURSE WITH THE GREATEST COOLNESS AND COUNTED THEM
OUT ON THE TABLE AND PUSHED THEM OVER TO ME THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE
HAD TAKEN HIS LEG FROM THE CHAIR HE SAT ASTRIDE OF THE CHAIR WHEN HE
HAD PUSHED THE MONEY OVER AND SAT SWINGING HIS PURSE AND EYEING JOE

WELL JOSEPH GARGERY YOU LOOK DUMBFOUNDERED

I AM SAID JOE IN A VERY DECIDED MANNER

IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WANTED NOTHING FOR YOURSELF REMEMBER

IT WERE UNDERSTOOD SAID JOE AND IT ARE UNDERSTOOD AND IT EVER
WILL BE SIMILAR ACCORDING

BUT WHAT SAID MR JAGGERS SWINGING HIS PURSEWHAT IF IT WAS IN MY
INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT AS COMPENSATION

AS COMPENSATION WHAT FOR JOE DEMANDED

FOR THE LOSS OF HIS SERVICES

JOE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WITH THE TOUCH OF A WOMAN I HAVE
OFTEN THOUGHT HIM SINCE LIKE THE STEAMHAMMER THAT CAN CRUSH A MAN OR
PAT AN EGGSHELL IN HIS COMBINATION OF STRENGTH WITH GENTLENESS PIP
IS THAT HEARTY WELCOME SAID JOE TO GO FREE WITH HIS SERVICES TO
HONOUR AND FORTUN AS NO WORDS CAN TELL HIM BUT IF YOU THINK AS MONEY
CAN MAKE COMPENSATION TO ME FOR THE LOSS OF THE LITTLE CHILDWHAT COME
TO THE FORGEAND EVER THE BEST OF FRIENDS

O DEAR GOOD JOE WHOM I WAS SO READY TO LEAVE AND SO UNTHANKFUL TO I
SEE YOU AGAIN WITH YOUR MUSCULAR BLACKSMITHS ARM BEFORE YOUR EYES
AND YOUR BROAD CHEST HEAVING AND YOUR VOICE DYING AWAY O DEAR GOOD
FAITHFUL TENDER JOE I FEEL THE LOVING TREMBLE OF YOUR HAND UPON MY
ARM AS SOLEMNLY THIS DAY AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE RUSTLE OF AN ANGELS
WING

BUT I ENCOURAGED JOE AT THE TIME I WAS LOST IN THE MAZES OF MY FUTURE
FORTUNES AND COULD NOT RETRACE THE BYPATHS WE HAD TRODDEN TOGETHER I
BEGGED JOE TO BE COMFORTED FOR AS HE SAID WE HAD EVER BEEN THE BEST
OF FRIENDS AND AS I SAID WE EVER WOULD BE SO JOE SCOOPED HIS EYES
WITH HIS DISENGAGED WRIST AS IF HE WERE BENT ON GOUGING HIMSELF BUT
SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD

MR JAGGERS HAD LOOKED ON AT THIS AS ONE WHO RECOGNISED IN JOE THE
VILLAGE IDIOT AND IN ME HIS KEEPER WHEN IT WAS OVER HE SAID
WEIGHING IN HIS HAND THE PURSE HE HAD CEASED TO SWING

NOW JOSEPH GARGERY I WARN YOU THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE NO HALF
MEASURES WITH ME IF YOU MEAN TO TAKE A PRESENT THAT I HAVE IT IN
CHARGE TO MAKE YOU SPEAK OUT AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT IF ON THE
CONTRARY YOU MEAN TO SAY HERE TO HIS GREAT AMAZEMENT HE WAS STOPPED
BY JOES SUDDENLY WORKING ROUND HIM WITH EVERY DEMONSTRATION OF A FELL
PUGILISTIC PURPOSE

WHICH I MEANTERSAY CRIED JOE THAT IF YOU COME INTO MY PLACE
BULLBAITING AND BADGERING ME COME OUT WHICH I MEANTERSAY AS SECH IF
YOURE A MAN COME ON WHICH I MEANTERSAY THAT WHAT I SAY I MEANTERSAY
AND STAND OR FALL BY

I DREW JOE AWAY AND HE IMMEDIATELY BECAME PLACABLE MERELY STATING TO
ME IN AN OBLIGING MANNER AND AS A POLITE EXPOSTULATORY NOTICE TO ANY
ONE WHOM IT MIGHT HAPPEN TO CONCERN THAT HE WERE NOT AGOING TO BE
BULLBAITED AND BADGERED IN HIS OWN PLACE MR JAGGERS HAD RISEN WHEN
JOE DEMONSTRATED AND HAD BACKED NEAR THE DOOR WITHOUT EVINCING ANY
INCLINATION TO COME IN AGAIN HE THERE DELIVERED HIS VALEDICTORY
REMARKS THEY WERE THESE

WELL MR PIP I THINK THE SOONER YOU LEAVE HEREAS YOU ARE TO BE A
GENTLEMANTHE BETTER LET IT STAND FOR THIS DAY WEEK AND YOU SHALL
RECEIVE MY PRINTED ADDRESS IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN TAKE A
HACKNEYCOACH AT THE STAGECOACH OFFICE IN LONDON AND COME STRAIGHT TO
ME UNDERSTAND THAT I EXPRESS NO OPINION ONE WAY OR OTHER ON THE
TRUST I UNDERTAKE I AM PAID FOR UNDERTAKING IT AND I DO SO NOW
UNDERSTAND THAT FINALLY UNDERSTAND THAT

HE WAS THROWING HIS FINGER AT BOTH OF US AND I THINK WOULD HAVE GONE
ON BUT FOR HIS SEEMING TO THINK JOE DANGEROUS AND GOING OFF

SOMETHING CAME INTO MY HEAD WHICH INDUCED ME TO RUN AFTER HIM AS HE
WAS GOING DOWN TO THE JOLLY BARGEMEN WHERE HE HAD LEFT A HIRED
CARRIAGE

I BEG YOUR PARDON MR JAGGERS

HALLOA SAID HE FACING ROUND WHATS THE MATTER

I WISH TO BE QUITE RIGHT MR JAGGERS AND TO KEEP TO YOUR DIRECTIONS
SO I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER ASK WOULD THERE BE ANY OBJECTION TO MY
TAKING LEAVE OF ANY ONE I KNOW ABOUT HERE BEFORE I GO AWAY

NO SAID HE LOOKING AS IF HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD ME

I DONT MEAN IN THE VILLAGE ONLY BUT UP TOWN

NO SAID HE NO OBJECTION

I THANKED HIM AND RAN HOME AGAIN AND THERE I FOUND THAT JOE HAD
ALREADY LOCKED THE FRONT DOOR AND VACATED THE STATE PARLOUR AND WAS
SEATED BY THE KITCHEN FIRE WITH A HAND ON EACH KNEE GAZING INTENTLY AT
THE BURNING COALS I TOO SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE AND GAZED AT THE
COALS AND NOTHING WAS SAID FOR A LONG TIME

MY SISTER WAS IN HER CUSHIONED CHAIR IN HER CORNER AND BIDDY SAT AT
HER NEEDLEWORK BEFORE THE FIRE AND JOE SAT NEXT BIDDY AND I SAT NEXT
JOE IN THE CORNER OPPOSITE MY SISTER THE MORE I LOOKED INTO THE
GLOWING COALS THE MORE INCAPABLE I BECAME OF LOOKING AT JOE THE
LONGER THE SILENCE LASTED THE MORE UNABLE I FELT TO SPEAK

AT LENGTH I GOT OUT JOE HAVE YOU TOLD BIDDY

NO PIP RETURNED JOE STILL LOOKING AT THE FIRE AND HOLDING HIS
KNEES TIGHT AS IF HE HAD PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT THEY INTENDED TO
MAKE OFF SOMEWHERE WHICH I LEFT IT TO YOURSELF PIP

I WOULD RATHER YOU TOLD JOE

PIPS A GENTLEMAN OF FORTUN THEN SAID JOE AND GOD BLESS HIM IN
IT

BIDDY DROPPED HER WORK AND LOOKED AT ME JOE HELD HIS KNEES AND LOOKED
AT ME I LOOKED AT BOTH OF THEM AFTER A PAUSE THEY BOTH HEARTILY
CONGRATULATED ME BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN TOUCH OF SADNESS IN THEIR
CONGRATULATIONS THAT I RATHER RESENTED

I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO IMPRESS BIDDY AND THROUGH BIDDY JOE WITH
THE GRAVE OBLIGATION I CONSIDERED MY FRIENDS UNDER TO KNOW NOTHING AND
SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE MAKER OF MY FORTUNE IT WOULD ALL COME OUT IN
GOOD TIME I OBSERVED AND IN THE MEANWHILE NOTHING WAS TO BE SAID
SAVE THAT I HAD COME INTO GREAT EXPECTATIONS FROM A MYSTERIOUS PATRON
BIDDY NODDED HER HEAD THOUGHTFULLY AT THE FIRE AS SHE TOOK UP HER WORK
AGAIN AND SAID SHE WOULD BE VERY PARTICULAR AND JOE STILL DETAINING
HIS KNEES SAID AY AY ILL BE EKERVALLY PARTICKLER PIP AND THEN
THEY CONGRATULATED ME AGAIN AND WENT ON TO EXPRESS SO MUCH WONDER AT
THE NOTION OF MY BEING A GENTLEMAN THAT I DIDNT HALF LIKE IT

INFINITE PAINS WERE THEN TAKEN BY BIDDY TO CONVEY TO MY SISTER SOME
IDEA OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THOSE EFFORTS
ENTIRELY FAILED SHE LAUGHED AND NODDED HER HEAD A GREAT MANY TIMES
AND EVEN REPEATED AFTER BIDDY THE WORDS PIP AND PROPERTY BUT I
DOUBT IF THEY HAD MORE MEANING IN THEM THAN AN ELECTION CRY AND I
CANNOT SUGGEST A DARKER PICTURE OF HER STATE OF MIND

I NEVER COULD HAVE BELIEVED IT WITHOUT EXPERIENCE BUT AS JOE AND BIDDY
BECAME MORE AT THEIR CHEERFUL EASE AGAIN I BECAME QUITE GLOOMY
DISSATISFIED WITH MY FORTUNE OF COURSE I COULD NOT BE BUT IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT I MAY HAVE BEEN WITHOUT QUITE KNOWING IT DISSATISFIED
WITH MYSELF

ANYHOW I SAT WITH MY ELBOW ON MY KNEE AND MY FACE UPON MY HAND
LOOKING INTO THE FIRE AS THOSE TWO TALKED ABOUT MY GOING AWAY AND
ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WITHOUT ME AND ALL THAT AND WHENEVER I
CAUGHT ONE OF THEM LOOKING AT ME THOUGH NEVER SO PLEASANTLY AND THEY
OFTEN LOOKED AT MEPARTICULARLY BIDDY I FELT OFFENDED AS IF THEY
WERE EXPRESSING SOME MISTRUST OF ME THOUGH HEAVEN KNOWS THEY NEVER DID
BY WORD OR SIGN

AT THOSE TIMES I WOULD GET UP AND LOOK OUT AT THE DOOR FOR OUR KITCHEN
DOOR OPENED AT ONCE UPON THE NIGHT AND STOOD OPEN ON SUMMER EVENINGS
TO AIR THE ROOM THE VERY STARS TO WHICH I THEN RAISED MY EYES I AM
AFRAID I TOOK TO BE BUT POOR AND HUMBLE STARS FOR GLITTERING ON THE
RUSTIC OBJECTS AMONG WHICH I HAD PASSED MY LIFE

SATURDAY NIGHT SAID I WHEN WE SAT AT OUR SUPPER OF BREAD AND CHEESE
AND BEER FIVE MORE DAYS AND THEN THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY THEYLL
SOON GO

YES PIP OBSERVED JOE WHOSE VOICE SOUNDED HOLLOW IN HIS BEERMUG
THEYLL SOON GO

SOON SOON GO SAID BIDDY

I HAVE BEEN THINKING JOE THAT WHEN I GO DOWN TOWN ON MONDAY AND
ORDER MY NEW CLOTHES I SHALL TELL THE TAILOR THAT ILL COME AND PUT
THEM ON THERE OR THAT ILL HAVE THEM SENT TO MR PUMBLECHOOKS IT
WOULD BE VERY DISAGREEABLE TO BE STARED AT BY ALL THE PEOPLE HERE

MR AND MRS HUBBLE MIGHT LIKE TO SEE YOU IN YOUR NEW GENTEEL FIGURE
TOO PIP SAID JOE INDUSTRIOUSLY CUTTING HIS BREAD WITH HIS CHEESE
ON IT IN THE PALM OF HIS LEFT HAND AND GLANCING AT MY UNTASTED SUPPER
AS IF HE THOUGHT OF THE TIME WHEN WE USED TO COMPARE SLICES SO MIGHT
WOPSLE AND THE JOLLY BARGEMEN MIGHT TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT

THATS JUST WHAT I DONT WANT JOE THEY WOULD MAKE SUCH A BUSINESS OF
ITSUCH A COARSE AND COMMON BUSINESSTHAT I COULDNT BEAR MYSELF

AH THAT INDEED PIP SAID JOE IF YOU COULDNT ABEAR YOURSELF

BIDDY ASKED ME HERE AS SHE SAT HOLDING MY SISTERS PLATE HAVE YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN YOULL SHOW YOURSELF TO MR GARGERY AND YOUR SISTER
AND ME YOU WILL SHOW YOURSELF TO US WONT YOU

BIDDY I RETURNED WITH SOME RESENTMENT YOU ARE SO EXCEEDINGLY QUICK
THAT ITS DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH YOU

SHE ALWAYS WERE QUICK OBSERVED JOE

IF YOU HAD WAITED ANOTHER MOMENT BIDDY YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ME SAY
THAT I SHALL BRING MY CLOTHES HERE IN A BUNDLE ONE EVENINGMOST LIKELY
ON THE EVENING BEFORE I GO AWAY

BIDDY SAID NO MORE HANDSOMELY FORGIVING HER I SOON EXCHANGED AN
AFFECTIONATE GOOD NIGHT WITH HER AND JOE AND WENT UP TO BED WHEN I
GOT INTO MY LITTLE ROOM I SAT DOWN AND TOOK A LONG LOOK AT IT AS A
MEAN LITTLE ROOM THAT I SHOULD SOON BE PARTED FROM AND RAISED ABOVE
FOR EVER IT WAS FURNISHED WITH FRESH YOUNG REMEMBRANCES TOO AND EVEN
AT THE SAME MOMENT I FELL INTO MUCH THE SAME CONFUSED DIVISION OF MIND
BETWEEN IT AND THE BETTER ROOMS TO WHICH I WAS GOING AS I HAD BEEN IN
SO OFTEN BETWEEN THE FORGE AND MISS HAVISHAMS AND BIDDY AND ESTELLA

THE SUN HAD BEEN SHINING BRIGHTLY ALL DAY ON THE ROOF OF MY ATTIC AND
THE ROOM WAS WARM AS I PUT THE WINDOW OPEN AND STOOD LOOKING OUT I
SAW JOE COME SLOWLY FORTH AT THE DARK DOOR BELOW AND TAKE A TURN OR
TWO IN THE AIR AND THEN I SAW BIDDY COME AND BRING HIM A PIPE AND
LIGHT IT FOR HIM HE NEVER SMOKED SO LATE AND IT SEEMED TO HINT TO ME
THAT HE WANTED COMFORTING FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER

HE PRESENTLY STOOD AT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY BENEATH ME SMOKING HIS
PIPE AND BIDDY STOOD THERE TOO QUIETLY TALKING TO HIM AND I KNEW
THAT THEY TALKED OF ME FOR I HEARD MY NAME MENTIONED IN AN ENDEARING
TONE BY BOTH OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE I WOULD NOT HAVE LISTENED FOR
MORE IF I COULD HAVE HEARD MORE SO I DREW AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AND
SAT DOWN IN MY ONE CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE FEELING IT VERY SORROWFUL AND
STRANGE THAT THIS FIRST NIGHT OF MY BRIGHT FORTUNES SHOULD BE THE
LONELIEST I HAD EVER KNOWN

LOOKING TOWARDS THE OPEN WINDOW I SAW LIGHT WREATHS FROM JOES PIPE
FLOATING THERE AND I FANCIED IT WAS LIKE A BLESSING FROM JOENOT
OBTRUDED ON ME OR PARADED BEFORE ME BUT PERVADING THE AIR WE SHARED
TOGETHER I PUT MY LIGHT OUT AND CREPT INTO BED AND IT WAS AN UNEASY
BED NOW AND I NEVER SLEPT THE OLD SOUND SLEEP IN IT ANY MORE




CHAPTER XIX


MORNING MADE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN MY GENERAL PROSPECT OF LIFE
AND BRIGHTENED IT SO MUCH THAT IT SCARCELY SEEMED THE SAME WHAT LAY
HEAVIEST ON MY MIND WAS THE CONSIDERATION THAT SIX DAYS INTERVENED
BETWEEN ME AND THE DAY OF DEPARTURE FOR I COULD NOT DIVEST MYSELF OF A
MISGIVING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO LONDON IN THE MEANWHILE AND
THAT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WOULD BE EITHER GREATLY DETERIORATED OR
CLEAN GONE

JOE AND BIDDY WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC AND PLEASANT WHEN I SPOKE OF OUR
APPROACHING SEPARATION BUT THEY ONLY REFERRED TO IT WHEN I DID AFTER
BREAKFAST JOE BROUGHT OUT MY INDENTURES FROM THE PRESS IN THE BEST
PARLOUR AND WE PUT THEM IN THE FIRE AND I FELT THAT I WAS FREE WITH
ALL THE NOVELTY OF MY EMANCIPATION ON ME I WENT TO CHURCH WITH JOE
AND THOUGHT PERHAPS THE CLERGYMAN WOULDNT HAVE READ THAT ABOUT THE
RICH MAN AND THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IF HE HAD KNOWN ALL

AFTER OUR EARLY DINNER I STROLLED OUT ALONE PURPOSING TO FINISH OFF
THE MARSHES AT ONCE AND GET THEM DONE WITH AS I PASSED THE CHURCH I
FELT AS I HAD FELT DURING SERVICE IN THE MORNING A SUBLIME COMPASSION
FOR THE POOR CREATURES WHO WERE DESTINED TO GO THERE SUNDAY AFTER
SUNDAY ALL THEIR LIVES THROUGH AND TO LIE OBSCURELY AT LAST AMONG THE
LOW GREEN MOUNDS I PROMISED MYSELF THAT I WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR THEM
ONE OF THESE DAYS AND FORMED A PLAN IN OUTLINE FOR BESTOWING A DINNER
OF ROASTBEEF AND PLUMPUDDING A PINT OF ALE AND A GALLON OF
CONDESCENSION UPON EVERYBODY IN THE VILLAGE

IF I HAD OFTEN THOUGHT BEFORE WITH SOMETHING ALLIED TO SHAME OF MY
COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE FUGITIVE WHOM I HAD ONCE SEEN LIMPING AMONG
THOSE GRAVES WHAT WERE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS SUNDAY WHEN THE PLACE
RECALLED THE WRETCH RAGGED AND SHIVERING WITH HIS FELON IRON AND
BADGE MY COMFORT WAS THAT IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND THAT HE
HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN TRANSPORTED A LONG WAY OFF AND THAT HE WAS DEAD TO
ME AND MIGHT BE VERITABLY DEAD INTO THE BARGAIN

NO MORE LOW WET GROUNDS NO MORE DIKES AND SLUICES NO MORE OF THESE
GRAZING CATTLETHOUGH THEY SEEMED IN THEIR DULL MANNER TO WEAR A
MORE RESPECTFUL AIR NOW AND TO FACE ROUND IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT
STARE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AT THE POSSESSOR OF SUCH GREAT
EXPECTATIONSFAREWELL MONOTONOUS ACQUAINTANCES OF MY CHILDHOOD
HENCEFORTH I WAS FOR LONDON AND GREATNESS NOT FOR SMITHS WORK IN
GENERAL AND FOR YOU I MADE MY EXULTANT WAY TO THE OLD BATTERY AND
LYING DOWN THERE TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION WHETHER MISS HAVISHAM
INTENDED ME FOR ESTELLA FELL ASLEEP

WHEN I AWOKE I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND JOE SITTING BESIDE ME
SMOKING HIS PIPE HE GREETED ME WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE ON MY OPENING MY
EYES AND SAID

AS BEING THE LAST TIME PIP I THOUGHT ID FOLLER

AND JOE I AM VERY GLAD YOU DID SO

THANKEE PIP

YOU MAY BE SURE DEAR JOE I WENT ON AFTER WE HAD SHAKEN HANDS
THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOU

NO NO PIP SAID JOE IN A COMFORTABLE TONE IM SURE OF THAT
AY AY OLD CHAP BLESS YOU IT WERE ONLY NECESSARY TO GET IT WELL
ROUND IN A MANS MIND TO BE CERTAIN ON IT BUT IT TOOK A BIT OF TIME
TO GET IT WELL ROUND THE CHANGE COME SO ONCOMMON PLUMP DIDNT IT

SOMEHOW I WAS NOT BEST PLEASED WITH JOES BEING SO MIGHTILY SECURE OF
ME I SHOULD HAVE LIKED HIM TO HAVE BETRAYED EMOTION OR TO HAVE SAID
IT DOES YOU CREDIT PIP OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THEREFORE I MADE
NO REMARK ON JOES FIRST HEAD MERELY SAYING AS TO HIS SECOND THAT THE
TIDINGS HAD INDEED COME SUDDENLY BUT THAT I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A
GENTLEMAN AND HAD OFTEN AND OFTEN SPECULATED ON WHAT I WOULD DO IF I
WERE ONE

HAVE YOU THOUGH SAID JOE ASTONISHING

ITS A PITY NOW JOE SAID I THAT YOU DID NOT GET ON A LITTLE MORE
WHEN WE HAD OUR LESSONS HERE ISNT IT

WELL I DONT KNOW RETURNED JOE IM SO AWFUL DULL IM ONLY MASTER
OF MY OWN TRADE IT WERE ALWAYS A PITY AS I WAS SO AWFUL DULL BUT ITS
NO MORE OF A PITY NOW THAN IT WASTHIS DAY TWELVEMONTHDONT YOU SEE

WHAT I HAD MEANT WAS THAT WHEN I CAME INTO MY PROPERTY AND WAS ABLE TO
DO SOMETHING FOR JOE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE AGREEABLE IF HE HAD
BEEN BETTER QUALIFIED FOR A RISE IN STATION HE WAS SO PERFECTLY
INNOCENT OF MY MEANING HOWEVER THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION IT TO
BIDDY IN PREFERENCE

SO WHEN WE HAD WALKED HOME AND HAD HAD TEA I TOOK BIDDY INTO OUR
LITTLE GARDEN BY THE SIDE OF THE LANE AND AFTER THROWING OUT IN A
GENERAL WAY FOR THE ELEVATION OF HER SPIRITS THAT I SHOULD NEVER
FORGET HER SAID I HAD A FAVOUR TO ASK OF HER

AND IT IS BIDDY SAID I THAT YOU WILL NOT OMIT ANY OPPORTUNITY OF
HELPING JOE ON A LITTLE

HOW HELPING HIM ON ASKED BIDDY WITH A STEADY SORT OF GLANCE

WELL JOE IS A DEAR GOOD FELLOWIN FACT I THINK HE IS THE DEAREST
FELLOW THAT EVER LIVEDBUT HE IS RATHER BACKWARD IN SOME THINGS FOR
INSTANCE BIDDY IN HIS LEARNING AND HIS MANNERS

ALTHOUGH I WAS LOOKING AT BIDDY AS I SPOKE AND ALTHOUGH SHE OPENED HER
EYES VERY WIDE WHEN I HAD SPOKEN SHE DID NOT LOOK AT ME

O HIS MANNERS WONT HIS MANNERS DO THEN ASKED BIDDY PLUCKING A
BLACKCURRANT LEAF

MY DEAR BIDDY THEY DO VERY WELL HERE

O THEY DO VERY WELL HERE INTERRUPTED BIDDY LOOKING CLOSELY AT
THE LEAF IN HER HAND

HEAR ME OUTBUT IF I WERE TO REMOVE JOE INTO A HIGHER SPHERE AS I
SHALL HOPE TO REMOVE HIM WHEN I FULLY COME INTO MY PROPERTY THEY WOULD
HARDLY DO HIM JUSTICE

AND DONT YOU THINK HE KNOWS THAT ASKED BIDDY

IT WAS SUCH A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR IT HAD NEVER IN THE MOST
DISTANT MANNER OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SAID SNAPPISHLY

BIDDY WHAT DO YOU MEAN

BIDDY HAVING RUBBED THE LEAF TO PIECES BETWEEN HER HANDSAND THE
SMELL OF A BLACKCURRANT BUSH HAS EVER SINCE RECALLED TO ME THAT
EVENING IN THE LITTLE GARDEN BY THE SIDE OF THE LANESAID HAVE YOU
NEVER CONSIDERED THAT HE MAY BE PROUD

PROUD I REPEATED WITH DISDAINFUL EMPHASIS

O THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF PRIDE SAID BIDDY LOOKING FULL AT ME AND
SHAKING HER HEAD PRIDE IS NOT ALL OF ONE KIND

WELL WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING FOR SAID I

NOT ALL OF ONE KIND RESUMED BIDDY HE MAY BE TOO PROUD TO LET ANY
ONE TAKE HIM OUT OF A PLACE THAT HE IS COMPETENT TO FILL AND FILLS
WELL AND WITH RESPECT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I THINK HE IS THOUGH IT
SOUNDS BOLD IN ME TO SAY SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW HIM FAR BETTER THAN I
DO

NOW BIDDY SAID I I AM VERY SORRY TO SEE THIS IN YOU I DID NOT
EXPECT TO SEE THIS IN YOU YOU ARE ENVIOUS BIDDY AND GRUDGING YOU
ARE DISSATISFIED ON ACCOUNT OF MY RISE IN FORTUNE AND YOU CANT HELP
SHOWING IT

IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO THINK SO RETURNED BIDDY SAY SO SAY SO
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO THINK SO

IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO BE SO YOU MEAN BIDDY SAID I IN A
VIRTUOUS AND SUPERIOR TONE DONT PUT IT OFF UPON ME I AM VERY SORRY
TO SEE IT AND ITS AITS A BAD SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE I DID INTEND TO
ASK YOU TO USE ANY LITTLE OPPORTUNITIES YOU MIGHT HAVE AFTER I WAS
GONE OF IMPROVING DEAR JOE BUT AFTER THIS I ASK YOU NOTHING I AM
EXTREMELY SORRY TO SEE THIS IN YOU BIDDY I REPEATED ITS AITS A
BAD SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE

WHETHER YOU SCOLD ME OR APPROVE OF ME RETURNED POOR BIDDY YOU MAY
EQUALLY DEPEND UPON MY TRYING TO DO ALL THAT LIES IN MY POWER HERE AT
ALL TIMES AND WHATEVER OPINION YOU TAKE AWAY OF ME SHALL MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE IN MY REMEMBRANCE OF YOU YET A GENTLEMAN SHOULD NOT BE
UNJUST NEITHER SAID BIDDY TURNING AWAY HER HEAD

I AGAIN WARMLY REPEATED THAT IT WAS A BAD SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE IN
WHICH SENTIMENT WAIVING ITS APPLICATION I HAVE SINCE SEEN REASON TO
THINK I WAS RIGHT AND I WALKED DOWN THE LITTLE PATH AWAY FROM BIDDY
AND BIDDY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND I WENT OUT AT THE GARDEN GATE AND
TOOK A DEJECTED STROLL UNTIL SUPPERTIME AGAIN FEELING IT VERY
SORROWFUL AND STRANGE THAT THIS THE SECOND NIGHT OF MY BRIGHT
FORTUNES SHOULD BE AS LONELY AND UNSATISFACTORY AS THE FIRST

BUT MORNING ONCE MORE BRIGHTENED MY VIEW AND I EXTENDED MY CLEMENCY
TO BIDDY AND WE DROPPED THE SUBJECT PUTTING ON THE BEST CLOTHES I
HAD I WENT INTO TOWN AS EARLY AS I COULD HOPE TO FIND THE SHOPS OPEN
AND PRESENTED MYSELF BEFORE MR TRABB THE TAILOR WHO WAS HAVING HIS
BREAKFAST IN THE PARLOUR BEHIND HIS SHOP AND WHO DID NOT THINK IT
WORTH HIS WHILE TO COME OUT TO ME BUT CALLED ME IN TO HIM

WELL SAID MR TRABB IN A HAILFELLOWWELLMET KIND OF WAY HOW ARE
YOU AND WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU

MR TRABB HAD SLICED HIS HOT ROLL INTO THREE FEATHERBEDS AND WAS
SLIPPING BUTTER IN BETWEEN THE BLANKETS AND COVERING IT UP HE WAS A
PROSPEROUS OLD BACHELOR AND HIS OPEN WINDOW LOOKED INTO A PROSPEROUS
LITTLE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AND THERE WAS A PROSPEROUS IRON SAFE LET
INTO THE WALL AT THE SIDE OF HIS FIREPLACE AND I DID NOT DOUBT THAT
HEAPS OF HIS PROSPERITY WERE PUT AWAY IN IT IN BAGS

MR TRABB SAID I ITS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO MENTION
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE BOASTING BUT I HAVE COME INTO A HANDSOME
PROPERTY

A CHANGE PASSED OVER MR TRABB HE FORGOT THE BUTTER IN BED GOT UP
FROM THE BEDSIDE AND WIPED HIS FINGERS ON THE TABLECLOTH EXCLAIMING
LORD BLESS MY SOUL

I AM GOING UP TO MY GUARDIAN IN LONDON SAID I CASUALLY DRAWING SOME
GUINEAS OUT OF MY POCKET AND LOOKING AT THEM AND I WANT A FASHIONABLE
SUIT OF CLOTHES TO GO IN I WISH TO PAY FOR THEM I ADDEDOTHERWISE I
THOUGHT HE MIGHT ONLY PRETEND TO MAKE THEM WITH READY MONEY

MY DEAR SIR SAID MR TRABB AS HE RESPECTFULLY BENT HIS BODY OPENED
HIS ARMS AND TOOK THE LIBERTY OF TOUCHING ME ON THE OUTSIDE OF EACH
ELBOW DONT HURT ME BY MENTIONING THAT MAY I VENTURE TO CONGRATULATE
YOU WOULD YOU DO ME THE FAVOUR OF STEPPING INTO THE SHOP

MR TRABBS BOY WAS THE MOST AUDACIOUS BOY IN ALL THAT COUNTRYSIDE
WHEN I HAD ENTERED HE WAS SWEEPING THE SHOP AND HE HAD SWEETENED HIS
LABOURS BY SWEEPING OVER ME HE WAS STILL SWEEPING WHEN I CAME OUT INTO
THE SHOP WITH MR TRABB AND HE KNOCKED THE BROOM AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE
CORNERS AND OBSTACLES TO EXPRESS AS I UNDERSTOOD IT EQUALITY WITH
ANY BLACKSMITH ALIVE OR DEAD

HOLD THAT NOISE SAID MR TRABB WITH THE GREATEST STERNNESS OR
ILL KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFFDO ME THE FAVOUR TO BE SEATED SIR NOW
THIS SAID MR TRABB TAKING DOWN A ROLL OF CLOTH AND TIDING IT OUT
IN A FLOWING MANNER OVER THE COUNTER PREPARATORY TO GETTING HIS HAND
UNDER IT TO SHOW THE GLOSS IS A VERY SWEET ARTICLE I CAN RECOMMEND
IT FOR YOUR PURPOSE SIR BECAUSE IT REALLY IS EXTRA SUPER BUT YOU
SHALL SEE SOME OTHERS GIVE ME NUMBER FOUR YOU TO THE BOY AND WITH
A DREADFULLY SEVERE STARE FORESEEING THE DANGER OF THAT MISCREANTS
BRUSHING ME WITH IT OR MAKING SOME OTHER SIGN OF FAMILIARITY

MR TRABB NEVER REMOVED HIS STERN EYE FROM THE BOY UNTIL HE HAD
DEPOSITED NUMBER FOUR ON THE COUNTER AND WAS AT A SAFE DISTANCE AGAIN
THEN HE COMMANDED HIM TO BRING NUMBER FIVE AND NUMBER EIGHT AND LET
ME HAVE NONE OF YOUR TRICKS HERE SAID MR TRABB OR YOU SHALL REPENT
IT YOU YOUNG SCOUNDREL THE LONGEST DAY YOU HAVE TO LIVE

MR TRABB THEN BENT OVER NUMBER FOUR AND IN A SORT OF DEFERENTIAL
CONFIDENCE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME AS A LIGHT ARTICLE FOR SUMMER WEAR AN
ARTICLE MUCH IN VOGUE AMONG THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY AN ARTICLE THAT IT
WOULD EVER BE AN HONOUR TO HIM TO REFLECT UPON A DISTINGUISHED
FELLOWTOWNSMANS IF HE MIGHT CLAIM ME FOR A FELLOWTOWNSMAN HAVING
WORN ARE YOU BRINGING NUMBERS FIVE AND EIGHT YOU VAGABOND SAID MR
TRABB TO THE BOY AFTER THAT OR SHALL I KICK YOU OUT OF THE SHOP AND
BRING THEM MYSELF

I SELECTED THE MATERIALS FOR A SUIT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MR TRABBS
JUDGMENT AND REENTERED THE PARLOUR TO BE MEASURED FOR ALTHOUGH MR
TRABB HAD MY MEASURE ALREADY AND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN QUITE CONTENTED
WITH IT HE SAID APOLOGETICALLY THAT IT WOULDNT DO UNDER EXISTING
CIRCUMSTANCES SIRWOULDNT DO AT ALL SO MR TRABB MEASURED AND
CALCULATED ME IN THE PARLOUR AS IF I WERE AN ESTATE AND HE THE FINEST
SPECIES OF SURVEYOR AND GAVE HIMSELF SUCH A WORLD OF TROUBLE THAT I
FELT THAT NO SUIT OF CLOTHES COULD POSSIBLY REMUNERATE HIM FOR HIS
PAINS WHEN HE HAD AT LAST DONE AND HAD APPOINTED TO SEND THE ARTICLES
TO MR PUMBLECHOOKS ON THE THURSDAY EVENING HE SAID WITH HIS HAND
UPON THE PARLOUR LOCK I KNOW SIR THAT LONDON GENTLEMEN CANNOT BE
EXPECTED TO PATRONISE LOCAL WORK AS A RULE BUT IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME A
TURN NOW AND THEN IN THE QUALITY OF A TOWNSMAN I SHOULD GREATLY ESTEEM
IT GOODMORNING SIR MUCH OBLIGEDDOOR

THE LAST WORD WAS FLUNG AT THE BOY WHO HAD NOT THE LEAST NOTION WHAT
IT MEANT BUT I SAW HIM COLLAPSE AS HIS MASTER RUBBED ME OUT WITH HIS
HANDS AND MY FIRST DECIDED EXPERIENCE OF THE STUPENDOUS POWER OF MONEY
WAS THAT IT HAD MORALLY LAID UPON HIS BACK TRABBS BOY

AFTER THIS MEMORABLE EVENT I WENT TO THE HATTERS AND THE
BOOTMAKERS AND THE HOSIERS AND FELT RATHER LIKE MOTHER HUBBARDS
DOG WHOSE OUTFIT REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF SO MANY TRADES I ALSO WENT
TO THE COACHOFFICE AND TOOK MY PLACE FOR SEVEN OCLOCK ON SATURDAY
MORNING IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN EVERYWHERE THAT I HAD COME
INTO A HANDSOME PROPERTY BUT WHENEVER I SAID ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT
IT FOLLOWED THAT THE OFFICIATING TRADESMAN CEASED TO HAVE HIS ATTENTION
DIVERTED THROUGH THE WINDOW BY THE HIGH STREET AND CONCENTRATED HIS
MIND UPON ME WHEN I HAD ORDERED EVERYTHING I WANTED I DIRECTED MY
STEPS TOWARDS PUMBLECHOOKS AND AS I APPROACHED THAT GENTLEMANS
PLACE OF BUSINESS I SAW HIM STANDING AT HIS DOOR

HE WAS WAITING FOR ME WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE HE HAD BEEN OUT EARLY WITH
THE CHAISECART AND HAD CALLED AT THE FORGE AND HEARD THE NEWS HE HAD
PREPARED A COLLATION FOR ME IN THE BARNWELL PARLOUR AND HE TOO ORDERED
HIS SHOPMAN TO COME OUT OF THE GANGWAY AS MY SACRED PERSON PASSED

MY DEAR FRIEND SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK TAKING ME BY BOTH HANDS WHEN
HE AND I AND THE COLLATION WERE ALONE I GIVE YOU JOY OF YOUR GOOD
FORTUNE WELL DESERVED WELL DESERVED

THIS WAS COMING TO THE POINT AND I THOUGHT IT A SENSIBLE WAY OF
EXPRESSING HIMSELF

TO THINK SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK AFTER SNORTING ADMIRATION AT ME FOR
SOME MOMENTS THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HUMBLE INSTRUMENT OF LEADING
UP TO THIS IS A PROUD REWARD

I BEGGED MR PUMBLECHOOK TO REMEMBER THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE EVER SAID
OR HINTED ON THAT POINT

MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO
CALL YOU SO

I MURMURED CERTAINLY AND MR PUMBLECHOOK TOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS
AGAIN AND COMMUNICATED A MOVEMENT TO HIS WAISTCOAT WHICH HAD AN
EMOTIONAL APPEARANCE THOUGH IT WAS RATHER LOW DOWN MY DEAR YOUNG
FRIEND RELY UPON MY DOING MY LITTLE ALL IN YOUR ABSENCE BY KEEPING
THE FACT BEFORE THE MIND OF JOSEPHJOSEPH SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK IN
THE WAY OF A COMPASSIONATE ADJURATION JOSEPH JOSEPH THEREUPON
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND TAPPED IT EXPRESSING HIS SENSE OF DEFICIENCY IN
JOSEPH

BUT MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK YOU MUST BE HUNGRY
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED BE SEATED HERE IS A CHICKEN HAD ROUND FROM THE
BOAR HERE IS A TONGUE HAD ROUND FROM THE BOAR HERES ONE OR TWO
LITTLE THINGS HAD ROUND FROM THE BOAR THAT I HOPE YOU MAY NOT DESPISE
BUT DO I SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK GETTING UP AGAIN THE MOMENT AFTER HE
HAD SAT DOWN SEE AFORE ME HIM AS I EVER SPORTED WITH IN HIS TIMES OF
HAPPY INFANCY AND MAY IMAY I

THIS MAY I MEANT MIGHT HE SHAKE HANDS I CONSENTED AND HE WAS
FERVENT AND THEN SAT DOWN AGAIN

HERE IS WINE SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK LET US DRINK THANKS TO FORTUNE
AND MAY SHE EVER PICK OUT HER FAVOURITES WITH EQUAL JUDGMENT AND YET I
CANNOT SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK GETTING UP AGAIN SEE AFORE ME ONEAND
LIKEWISE DRINK TO ONEWITHOUT AGAIN EXPRESSINGMAY IMAY I

I SAID HE MIGHT AND HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AGAIN AND EMPTIED HIS
GLASS AND TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN I DID THE SAME AND IF I HAD TURNED
MYSELF UPSIDE DOWN BEFORE DRINKING THE WINE COULD NOT HAVE GONE MORE
DIRECT TO MY HEAD

MR PUMBLECHOOK HELPED ME TO THE LIVER WING AND TO THE BEST SLICE OF
TONGUE NONE OF THOSE OUTOFTHEWAY NO THOROUGHFARES OF PORK NOW AND
TOOK COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING NO CARE OF HIMSELF AT ALL AH POULTRY
POULTRY YOU LITTLE THOUGHT SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK APOSTROPHISING THE
FOWL IN THE DISH WHEN YOU WAS A YOUNG FLEDGLING WHAT WAS IN STORE
FOR YOU YOU LITTLE THOUGHT YOU WAS TO BE REFRESHMENT BENEATH THIS
HUMBLE ROOF FOR ONE ASCALL IT A WEAKNESS IF YOU WILL SAID MR
PUMBLECHOOK GETTING UP AGAIN BUT MAY I MAY I

IT BEGAN TO BE UNNECESSARY TO REPEAT THE FORM OF SAYING HE MIGHT SO HE
DID IT AT ONCE HOW HE EVER DID IT SO OFTEN WITHOUT WOUNDING HIMSELF
WITH MY KNIFE I DONT KNOW

AND YOUR SISTER HE RESUMED AFTER A LITTLE STEADY EATING WHICH HAD
THE HONOUR OF BRINGING YOU UP BY HAND ITS A SAD PICTER TO REFLECT
THAT SHES NO LONGER EQUAL TO FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE HONOUR MAY

I SAW HE WAS ABOUT TO COME AT ME AGAIN AND I STOPPED HIM

WELL DRINK HER HEALTH SAID I

AH CRIED MR PUMBLECHOOK LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR QUITE FLACCID
WITH ADMIRATION THATS THE WAY YOU KNOW EM SIR I DONT KNOW WHO
SIR WAS BUT HE CERTAINLY WAS NOT I AND THERE WAS NO THIRD PERSON
PRESENT THATS THE WAY YOU KNOW THE NOBLEMINDED SIR EVER
FORGIVING AND EVER AFFABLE IT MIGHT SAID THE SERVILE PUMBLECHOOK
PUTTING DOWN HIS UNTASTED GLASS IN A HURRY AND GETTING UP AGAIN TO A
COMMON PERSON HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF REPEATINGBUT MAY I

WHEN HE HAD DONE IT HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AND DRANK TO MY SISTER LET
US NEVER BE BLIND SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK TO HER FAULTS OF TEMPER BUT
IT IS TO BE HOPED SHE MEANT WELL

AT ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS GETTING FLUSHED IN
THE FACE AS TO MYSELF I FELT ALL FACE STEEPED IN WINE AND SMARTING

I MENTIONED TO MR PUMBLECHOOK THAT I WISHED TO HAVE MY NEW CLOTHES
SENT TO HIS HOUSE AND HE WAS ECSTATIC ON MY SO DISTINGUISHING HIM I
MENTIONED MY REASON FOR DESIRING TO AVOID OBSERVATION IN THE VILLAGE
AND HE LAUDED IT TO THE SKIES THERE WAS NOBODY BUT HIMSELF HE
INTIMATED WORTHY OF MY CONFIDENCE ANDIN SHORT MIGHT HE THEN HE
ASKED ME TENDERLY IF I REMEMBERED OUR BOYISH GAMES AT SUMS AND HOW WE
HAD GONE TOGETHER TO HAVE ME BOUND APPRENTICE AND IN EFFECT HOW HE
HAD EVER BEEN MY FAVOURITE FANCY AND MY CHOSEN FRIEND IF I HAD TAKEN
TEN TIMES AS MANY GLASSES OF WINE AS I HAD I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE
NEVER HAD STOOD IN THAT RELATION TOWARDS ME AND SHOULD IN MY HEART OF
HEARTS HAVE REPUDIATED THE IDEA YET FOR ALL THAT I REMEMBER FEELING
CONVINCED THAT I HAD BEEN MUCH MISTAKEN IN HIM AND THAT HE WAS A
SENSIBLE PRACTICAL GOODHEARTED PRIME FELLOW

BY DEGREES HE FELL TO REPOSING SUCH GREAT CONFIDENCE IN ME AS TO ASK
MY ADVICE IN REFERENCE TO HIS OWN AFFAIRS HE MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A GREAT AMALGAMATION AND MONOPOLY OF THE CORN AND
SEED TRADE ON THOSE PREMISES IF ENLARGED SUCH AS HAD NEVER OCCURRED
BEFORE IN THAT OR ANY OTHER NEIGHBOURHOOD WHAT ALONE WAS WANTING TO
THE REALISATION OF A VAST FORTUNE HE CONSIDERED TO BE MORE CAPITAL
THOSE WERE THE TWO LITTLE WORDS MORE CAPITAL NOW IT APPEARED TO HIM
PUMBLECHOOK THAT IF THAT CAPITAL WERE GOT INTO THE BUSINESS THROUGH
A SLEEPING PARTNER SIRWHICH SLEEPING PARTNER WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO
DO BUT WALK IN BY SELF OR DEPUTY WHENEVER HE PLEASED AND EXAMINE THE
BOOKSAND WALK IN TWICE A YEAR AND TAKE HIS PROFITS AWAY IN HIS
POCKET TO THE TUNE OF FIFTY PER CENTIT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THAT
MIGHT BE AN OPENING FOR A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF SPIRIT COMBINED WITH
PROPERTY WHICH WOULD BE WORTHY OF HIS ATTENTION BUT WHAT DID I THINK
HE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY OPINION AND WHAT DID I THINK I GAVE IT
AS MY OPINION WAIT A BIT THE UNITED VASTNESS AND DISTINCTNESS OF
THIS VIEW SO STRUCK HIM THAT HE NO LONGER ASKED IF HE MIGHT SHAKE
HANDS WITH ME BUT SAID HE REALLY MUSTAND DID

WE DRANK ALL THE WINE AND MR PUMBLECHOOK PLEDGED HIMSELF OVER AND
OVER AGAIN TO KEEP JOSEPH UP TO THE MARK I DONT KNOW WHAT MARK AND
TO RENDER ME EFFICIENT AND CONSTANT SERVICE I DONT KNOW WHAT
SERVICE HE ALSO MADE KNOWN TO ME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AND
CERTAINLY AFTER HAVING KEPT HIS SECRET WONDERFULLY WELL THAT HE HAD
ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT BOY IS NO COMMON BOY AND MARK ME HIS FORTUN
WILL BE NO COMMON FORTUN HE SAID WITH A TEARFUL SMILE THAT IT WAS A
SINGULAR THING TO THINK OF NOW AND I SAID SO TOO FINALLY I WENT OUT
INTO THE AIR WITH A DIM PERCEPTION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNWONTED
IN THE CONDUCT OF THE SUNSHINE AND FOUND THAT I HAD SLUMBEROUSLY GOT
TO THE TURNPIKE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN ANY ACCOUNT OF THE ROAD

THERE I WAS ROUSED BY MR PUMBLECHOOKS HAILING ME HE WAS A LONG WAY
DOWN THE SUNNY STREET AND WAS MAKING EXPRESSIVE GESTURES FOR ME TO
STOP I STOPPED AND HE CAME UP BREATHLESS

NO MY DEAR FRIEND SAID HE WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED WIND FOR SPEECH
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT THIS OCCASION SHALL NOT ENTIRELY PASS WITHOUT
THAT AFFABILITY ON YOUR PARTMAY I AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WELLWISHER
MAY I

WE SHOOK HANDS FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME AT LEAST AND HE ORDERED A YOUNG
CARTER OUT OF MY WAY WITH THE GREATEST INDIGNATION THEN HE BLESSED ME
AND STOOD WAVING HIS HAND TO ME UNTIL I HAD PASSED THE CROOK IN THE
ROAD AND THEN I TURNED INTO A FIELD AND HAD A LONG NAP UNDER A HEDGE
BEFORE I PURSUED MY WAY HOME

I HAD SCANT LUGGAGE TO TAKE WITH ME TO LONDON FOR LITTLE OF THE LITTLE
I POSSESSED WAS ADAPTED TO MY NEW STATION BUT I BEGAN PACKING THAT
SAME AFTERNOON AND WILDLY PACKED UP THINGS THAT I KNEW I SHOULD WANT
NEXT MORNING IN A FICTION THAT THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST

SO TUESDAY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY PASSED AND ON FRIDAY MORNING I
WENT TO MR PUMBLECHOOKS TO PUT ON MY NEW CLOTHES AND PAY MY VISIT TO
MISS HAVISHAM MR PUMBLECHOOKS OWN ROOM WAS GIVEN UP TO ME TO DRESS
IN AND WAS DECORATED WITH CLEAN TOWELS EXPRESSLY FOR THE EVENT MY
CLOTHES WERE RATHER A DISAPPOINTMENT OF COURSE PROBABLY EVERY NEW AND
EAGERLY EXPECTED GARMENT EVER PUT ON SINCE CLOTHES CAME IN FELL A
TRIFLE SHORT OF THE WEARERS EXPECTATION BUT AFTER I HAD HAD MY NEW
SUIT ON SOME HALF AN HOUR AND HAD GONE THROUGH AN IMMENSITY OF
POSTURING WITH MR PUMBLECHOOKS VERY LIMITED DRESSINGGLASS IN THE
FUTILE ENDEAVOUR TO SEE MY LEGS IT SEEMED TO FIT ME BETTER IT BEING
MARKET MORNING AT A NEIGHBOURING TOWN SOME TEN MILES OFF MR
PUMBLECHOOK WAS NOT AT HOME I HAD NOT TOLD HIM EXACTLY WHEN I MEANT TO
LEAVE AND WAS NOT LIKELY TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AGAIN BEFORE
DEPARTING THIS WAS ALL AS IT SHOULD BE AND I WENT OUT IN MY NEW
ARRAY FEARFULLY ASHAMED OF HAVING TO PASS THE SHOPMAN AND SUSPICIOUS
AFTER ALL THAT I WAS AT A PERSONAL DISADVANTAGE SOMETHING LIKE JOES
IN HIS SUNDAY SUIT

I WENT CIRCUITOUSLY TO MISS HAVISHAMS BY ALL THE BACK WAYS AND RANG
AT THE BELL CONSTRAINEDLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE STIFF LONG FINGERS OF MY
GLOVES SARAH POCKET CAME TO THE GATE AND POSITIVELY REELED BACK WHEN
SHE SAW ME SO CHANGED HER WALNUTSHELL COUNTENANCE LIKEWISE TURNED
FROM BROWN TO GREEN AND YELLOW

YOU SAID SHE YOU GOOD GRACIOUS WHAT DO YOU WANT

I AM GOING TO LONDON MISS POCKET SAID I AND WANT TO SAY GOODBYE
TO MISS HAVISHAM

I WAS NOT EXPECTED FOR SHE LEFT ME LOCKED IN THE YARD WHILE SHE WENT
TO ASK IF I WERE TO BE ADMITTED AFTER A VERY SHORT DELAY SHE RETURNED
AND TOOK ME UP STARING AT ME ALL THE WAY

MISS HAVISHAM WAS TAKING EXERCISE IN THE ROOM WITH THE LONG SPREAD
TABLE LEANING ON HER CRUTCH STICK THE ROOM WAS LIGHTED AS OF YORE
AND AT THE SOUND OF OUR ENTRANCE SHE STOPPED AND TURNED SHE WAS THEN
JUST ABREAST OF THE ROTTED BRIDECAKE

DONT GO SARAH SHE SAID WELL PIP

I START FOR LONDON MISS HAVISHAM TOMORROW I WAS EXCEEDINGLY
CAREFUL WHAT I SAID AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD KINDLY NOT MIND MY TAKING
LEAVE OF YOU

THIS IS A GAY FIGURE PIP SAID SHE MAKING HER CRUTCH STICK PLAY
ROUND ME AS IF SHE THE FAIRY GODMOTHER WHO HAD CHANGED ME WERE
BESTOWING THE FINISHING GIFT

I HAVE COME INTO SUCH GOOD FORTUNE SINCE I SAW YOU LAST MISS
HAVISHAM I MURMURED AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR IT MISS HAVISHAM

AY AY SAID SHE LOOKING AT THE DISCOMFITED AND ENVIOUS SARAH WITH
DELIGHT I HAVE SEEN MR JAGGERS I HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT PIP SO YOU

SARAHS COUNTENANCE WRUNG OUT OF HER WATCHFUL FACE A CRUEL SMILE

YES MISS HAVISHAM

GOODBYE PIP

SHE STRETCHED OUT HER HAND AND I WENT DOWN ON MY KNEE AND PUT IT TO MY
LIPS I HAD NOT CONSIDERED HOW I SHOULD TAKE LEAVE OF HER IT CAME
NATURALLY TO ME AT THE MOMENT TO DO THIS SHE LOOKED AT SARAH POCKET
WITH TRIUMPH IN HER WEIRD EYES AND SO I LEFT MY FAIRY GODMOTHER WITH
BOTH HER HANDS ON HER CRUTCH STICK STANDING IN THE MIDST OF THE DIMLY
LIGHTED ROOM BESIDE THE ROTTEN BRIDECAKE THAT WAS HIDDEN IN COBWEBS

SARAH POCKET CONDUCTED ME DOWN AS IF I WERE A GHOST WHO MUST BE SEEN
OUT SHE COULD NOT GET OVER MY APPEARANCE AND WAS IN THE LAST DEGREE
CONFOUNDED I SAID GOODBYE MISS POCKET BUT SHE MERELY STARED AND
DID NOT SEEM COLLECTED ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I HAD SPOKEN CLEAR OF THE
HOUSE I MADE THE BEST OF MY WAY BACK TO PUMBLECHOOKS TOOK OFF MY NEW
CLOTHES MADE THEM INTO A BUNDLE AND WENT BACK HOME IN MY OLDER DRESS
CARRYING ITTO SPEAK THE TRUTHMUCH MORE AT MY EASE TOO THOUGH I HAD
THE BUNDLE TO CARRY

AND NOW THOSE SIX DAYS WHICH WERE TO HAVE RUN OUT SO SLOWLY HAD RUN
OUT FAST AND WERE GONE AND TOMORROW LOOKED ME IN THE FACE MORE
STEADILY THAN I COULD LOOK AT IT AS THE SIX EVENINGS HAD DWINDLED
AWAY TO FIVE TO FOUR TO THREE TO TWO I HAD BECOME MORE AND MORE
APPRECIATIVE OF THE SOCIETY OF JOE AND BIDDY ON THIS LAST EVENING I
DRESSED MYSELF OUT IN MY NEW CLOTHES FOR THEIR DELIGHT AND SAT IN MY
SPLENDOUR UNTIL BEDTIME WE HAD A HOT SUPPER ON THE OCCASION
GRACED BY THE INEVITABLE ROAST FOWL AND WE HAD SOME FLIP TO FINISH
WITH WE WERE ALL VERY LOW AND NONE THE HIGHER FOR PRETENDING TO BE IN
SPIRITS

I WAS TO LEAVE OUR VILLAGE AT FIVE IN THE MORNING CARRYING MY LITTLE
HANDPORTMANTEAU AND I HAD TOLD JOE THAT I WISHED TO WALK AWAY ALL
ALONE I AM AFRAIDSORE AFRAIDTHAT THIS PURPOSE ORIGINATED IN MY SENSE
OF THE CONTRAST THERE WOULD BE BETWEEN ME AND JOE IF WE WENT TO THE
COACH TOGETHER I HAD PRETENDED WITH MYSELF THAT THERE WAS NOTHING OF
THIS TAINT IN THE ARRANGEMENT BUT WHEN I WENT UP TO MY LITTLE ROOM ON
THIS LAST NIGHT I FELT COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND HAD
AN IMPULSE UPON ME TO GO DOWN AGAIN AND ENTREAT JOE TO WALK WITH ME IN
THE MORNING I DID NOT

ALL NIGHT THERE WERE COACHES IN MY BROKEN SLEEP GOING TO WRONG PLACES
INSTEAD OF TO LONDON AND HAVING IN THE TRACES NOW DOGS NOW CATS NOW
PIGS NOW MENNEVER HORSES FANTASTIC FAILURES OF JOURNEYS OCCUPIED ME
UNTIL THE DAY DAWNED AND THE BIRDS WERE SINGING THEN I GOT UP AND
PARTLY DRESSED AND SAT AT THE WINDOW TO TAKE A LAST LOOK OUT AND IN
TAKING IT FELL ASLEEP

BIDDY WAS ASTIR SO EARLY TO GET MY BREAKFAST THAT ALTHOUGH I DID NOT
SLEEP AT THE WINDOW AN HOUR I SMELT THE SMOKE OF THE KITCHEN FIRE WHEN
I STARTED UP WITH A TERRIBLE IDEA THAT IT MUST BE LATE IN THE
AFTERNOON BUT LONG AFTER THAT AND LONG AFTER I HAD HEARD THE CLINKING
OF THE TEACUPS AND WAS QUITE READY I WANTED THE RESOLUTION TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS AFTER ALL I REMAINED UP THERE REPEATEDLY UNLOCKING AND
UNSTRAPPING MY SMALL PORTMANTEAU AND LOCKING AND STRAPPING IT UP AGAIN
UNTIL BIDDY CALLED TO ME THAT I WAS LATE

IT WAS A HURRIED BREAKFAST WITH NO TASTE IN IT I GOT UP FROM THE MEAL
SAYING WITH A SORT OF BRISKNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO ME
WELL I SUPPOSE I MUST BE OFF AND THEN I KISSED MY SISTER WHO WAS
LAUGHING AND NODDING AND SHAKING IN HER USUAL CHAIR AND KISSED BIDDY
AND THREW MY ARMS AROUND JOES NECK THEN I TOOK UP MY LITTLE
PORTMANTEAU AND WALKED OUT THE LAST I SAW OF THEM WAS WHEN I
PRESENTLY HEARD A SCUFFLE BEHIND ME AND LOOKING BACK SAW JOE THROWING
AN OLD SHOE AFTER ME AND BIDDY THROWING ANOTHER OLD SHOE I STOPPED
THEN TO WAVE MY HAT AND DEAR OLD JOE WAVED HIS STRONG RIGHT ARM ABOVE
HIS HEAD CRYING HUSKILY HOOROAR AND BIDDY PUT HER APRON TO HER
FACE

I WALKED AWAY AT A GOOD PACE THINKING IT WAS EASIER TO GO THAN I HAD
SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE AND REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE TO
HAVE HAD AN OLD SHOE THROWN AFTER THE COACH IN SIGHT OF ALL THE HIGH
STREET I WHISTLED AND MADE NOTHING OF GOING BUT THE VILLAGE WAS VERY
PEACEFUL AND QUIET AND THE LIGHT MISTS WERE SOLEMNLY RISING AS IF TO
SHOW ME THE WORLD AND I HAD BEEN SO INNOCENT AND LITTLE THERE AND ALL
BEYOND WAS SO UNKNOWN AND GREAT THAT IN A MOMENT WITH A STRONG HEAVE
AND SOB I BROKE INTO TEARS IT WAS BY THE FINGERPOST AT THE END OF THE
VILLAGE AND I LAID MY HAND UPON IT AND SAID GOODBYE O MY DEAR
DEAR FRIEND

HEAVEN KNOWS WE NEED NEVER BE ASHAMED OF OUR TEARS FOR THEY ARE RAIN
UPON THE BLINDING DUST OF EARTH OVERLYING OUR HARD HEARTS I WAS
BETTER AFTER I HAD CRIED THAN BEFOREMORE SORRY MORE AWARE OF MY OWN
INGRATITUDE MORE GENTLE IF I HAD CRIED BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE HAD JOE
WITH ME THEN

SO SUBDUED I WAS BY THOSE TEARS AND BY THEIR BREAKING OUT AGAIN IN THE
COURSE OF THE QUIET WALK THAT WHEN I WAS ON THE COACH AND IT WAS
CLEAR OF THE TOWN I DELIBERATED WITH AN ACHING HEART WHETHER I WOULD
NOT GET DOWN WHEN WE CHANGED HORSES AND WALK BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER
EVENING AT HOME AND A BETTER PARTING WE CHANGED AND I HAD NOT MADE
UP MY MIND AND STILL REFLECTED FOR MY COMFORT THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE
PRACTICABLE TO GET DOWN AND WALK BACK WHEN WE CHANGED AGAIN AND WHILE
I WAS OCCUPIED WITH THESE DELIBERATIONS I WOULD FANCY AN EXACT
RESEMBLANCE TO JOE IN SOME MAN COMING ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS US AND MY
HEART WOULD BEAT HIGHAS IF HE COULD POSSIBLY BE THERE

WE CHANGED AGAIN AND YET AGAIN AND IT WAS NOW TOO LATE AND TOO FAR TO
GO BACK AND I WENT ON AND THE MISTS HAD ALL SOLEMNLY RISEN NOW AND
THE WORLD LAY SPREAD BEFORE ME

THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST STAGE OF PIPS EXPECTATIONS




CHAPTER XX


THE JOURNEY FROM OUR TOWN TO THE METROPOLIS WAS A JOURNEY OF ABOUT FIVE
HOURS IT WAS A LITTLE PAST MIDDAY WHEN THE FOURHORSE STAGECOACH BY
WHICH I WAS A PASSENGER GOT INTO THE RAVEL OF TRAFFIC FRAYED OUT ABOUT
THE CROSS KEYS WOOD STREET CHEAPSIDE LONDON

WE BRITONS HAD AT THAT TIME PARTICULARLY SETTLED THAT IT WAS
TREASONABLE TO DOUBT OUR HAVING AND OUR BEING THE BEST OF EVERYTHING
OTHERWISE WHILE I WAS SCARED BY THE IMMENSITY OF LONDON I THINK I
MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME FAINT DOUBTS WHETHER IT WAS NOT RATHER UGLY
CROOKED NARROW AND DIRTY

MR JAGGERS HAD DULY SENT ME HIS ADDRESS IT WAS LITTLE BRITAIN AND
HE HAD WRITTEN AFTER IT ON HIS CARD JUST OUT OF SMITHFIELD AND CLOSE
BY THE COACHOFFICE NEVERTHELESS A HACKNEYCOACHMAN WHO SEEMED TO
HAVE AS MANY CAPES TO HIS GREASY GREATCOAT AS HE WAS YEARS OLD PACKED
ME UP IN HIS COACH AND HEMMED ME IN WITH A FOLDING AND JINGLING BARRIER
OF STEPS AS IF HE WERE GOING TO TAKE ME FIFTY MILES HIS GETTING ON
HIS BOX WHICH I REMEMBER TO HAVE BEEN DECORATED WITH AN OLD
WEATHERSTAINED PEAGREEN HAMMERCLOTH MOTHEATEN INTO RAGS WAS QUITE A
WORK OF TIME IT WAS A WONDERFUL EQUIPAGE WITH SIX GREAT CORONETS
OUTSIDE AND RAGGED THINGS BEHIND FOR I DONT KNOW HOW MANY FOOTMEN TO
HOLD ON BY AND A HARROW BELOW THEM TO PREVENT AMATEUR FOOTMEN FROM
YIELDING TO THE TEMPTATION

I HAD SCARCELY HAD TIME TO ENJOY THE COACH AND TO THINK HOW LIKE A
STRAWYARD IT WAS AND YET HOW LIKE A RAGSHOP AND TO WONDER WHY THE
HORSES NOSEBAGS WERE KEPT INSIDE WHEN I OBSERVED THE COACHMAN
BEGINNING TO GET DOWN AS IF WE WERE GOING TO STOP PRESENTLY AND STOP
WE PRESENTLY DID IN A GLOOMY STREET AT CERTAIN OFFICES WITH AN OPEN
DOOR WHEREON WAS PAINTED MR JAGGERS

HOW MUCH I ASKED THE COACHMAN

THE COACHMAN ANSWERED A SHILLINGUNLESS YOU WISH TO MAKE IT MORE

I NATURALLY SAID I HAD NO WISH TO MAKE IT MORE

THEN IT MUST BE A SHILLING OBSERVED THE COACHMAN I DONT WANT TO
GET INTO TROUBLE I KNOW HIM HE DARKLY CLOSED AN EYE AT MR
JAGGERSS NAME AND SHOOK HIS HEAD

WHEN HE HAD GOT HIS SHILLING AND HAD IN COURSE OF TIME COMPLETED THE
ASCENT TO HIS BOX AND HAD GOT AWAY WHICH APPEARED TO RELIEVE HIS
MIND I WENT INTO THE FRONT OFFICE WITH MY LITTLE PORTMANTEAU IN MY
HAND AND ASKED WAS MR JAGGERS AT HOME

HE IS NOT RETURNED THE CLERK HE IS IN COURT AT PRESENT AM I
ADDRESSING MR PIP

I SIGNIFIED THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING MR PIP

MR JAGGERS LEFT WORD WOULD YOU WAIT IN HIS ROOM HE COULDNT SAY HOW
LONG HE MIGHT BE HAVING A CASE ON BUT IT STANDS TO REASON HIS TIME
BEING VALUABLE THAT HE WONT BE LONGER THAN HE CAN HELP

WITH THOSE WORDS THE CLERK OPENED A DOOR AND USHERED ME INTO AN INNER
CHAMBER AT THE BACK HERE WE FOUND A GENTLEMAN WITH ONE EYE IN A
VELVETEEN SUIT AND KNEEBREECHES WHO WIPED HIS NOSE WITH HIS SLEEVE ON
BEING INTERRUPTED IN THE PERUSAL OF THE NEWSPAPER

GO AND WAIT OUTSIDE MIKE SAID THE CLERK

I BEGAN TO SAY THAT I HOPED I WAS NOT INTERRUPTING WHEN THE CLERK
SHOVED THIS GENTLEMAN OUT WITH AS LITTLE CEREMONY AS I EVER SAW USED
AND TOSSING HIS FUR CAP OUT AFTER HIM LEFT ME ALONE

MR JAGGERSS ROOM WAS LIGHTED BY A SKYLIGHT ONLY AND WAS A MOST
DISMAL PLACE THE SKYLIGHT ECCENTRICALLY PITCHED LIKE A BROKEN HEAD
AND THE DISTORTED ADJOINING HOUSES LOOKING AS IF THEY HAD TWISTED
THEMSELVES TO PEEP DOWN AT ME THROUGH IT THERE WERE NOT SO MANY PAPERS
ABOUT AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE AND THERE WERE SOME ODD
OBJECTS ABOUT THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO SEESUCH AS AN OLD
RUSTY PISTOL A SWORD IN A SCABBARD SEVERAL STRANGELOOKING BOXES AND
PACKAGES AND TWO DREADFUL CASTS ON A SHELF OF FACES PECULIARLY
SWOLLEN AND TWITCHY ABOUT THE NOSE MR JAGGERSS OWN HIGHBACKED
CHAIR WAS OF DEADLY BLACK HORSEHAIR WITH ROWS OF BRASS NAILS ROUND IT
LIKE A COFFIN AND I FANCIED I COULD SEE HOW HE LEANED BACK IN IT AND
BIT HIS FOREFINGER AT THE CLIENTS THE ROOM WAS BUT SMALL AND THE
CLIENTS SEEMED TO HAVE HAD A HABIT OF BACKING UP AGAINST THE WALL THE
WALL ESPECIALLY OPPOSITE TO MR JAGGERSS CHAIR BEING GREASY WITH
SHOULDERS I RECALLED TOO THAT THE ONEEYED GENTLEMAN HAD SHUFFLED
FORTH AGAINST THE WALL WHEN I WAS THE INNOCENT CAUSE OF HIS BEING
TURNED OUT

I SAT DOWN IN THE CLIENTAL CHAIR PLACED OVER AGAINST MR JAGGERSS
CHAIR AND BECAME FASCINATED BY THE DISMAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLACE I
CALLED TO MIND THAT THE CLERK HAD THE SAME AIR OF KNOWING SOMETHING TO
EVERYBODY ELSES DISADVANTAGE AS HIS MASTER HAD I WONDERED HOW MANY
OTHER CLERKS THERE WERE UPSTAIRS AND WHETHER THEY ALL CLAIMED TO HAVE
THE SAME DETRIMENTAL MASTERY OF THEIR FELLOWCREATURES I WONDERED WHAT
WAS THE HISTORY OF ALL THE ODD LITTER ABOUT THE ROOM AND HOW IT CAME
THERE I WONDERED WHETHER THE TWO SWOLLEN FACES WERE OF MR JAGGERSS
FAMILY AND IF HE WERE SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE HAD A PAIR OF SUCH
ILLLOOKING RELATIONS WHY HE STUCK THEM ON THAT DUSTY PERCH FOR THE
BLACKS AND FLIES TO SETTLE ON INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM A PLACE AT HOME
OF COURSE I HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF A LONDON SUMMER DAY AND MY SPIRITS
MAY HAVE BEEN OPPRESSED BY THE HOT EXHAUSTED AIR AND BY THE DUST AND
GRIT THAT LAY THICK ON EVERYTHING BUT I SAT WONDERING AND WAITING IN
MR JAGGERSS CLOSE ROOM UNTIL I REALLY COULD NOT BEAR THE TWO CASTS
ON THE SHELF ABOVE MR JAGGERSS CHAIR AND GOT UP AND WENT OUT

WHEN I TOLD THE CLERK THAT I WOULD TAKE A TURN IN THE AIR WHILE I
WAITED HE ADVISED ME TO GO ROUND THE CORNER AND I SHOULD COME INTO
SMITHFIELD SO I CAME INTO SMITHFIELD AND THE SHAMEFUL PLACE BEING
ALL ASMEAR WITH FILTH AND FAT AND BLOOD AND FOAM SEEMED TO STICK TO
ME SO I RUBBED IT OFF WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED BY TURNING INTO A
STREET WHERE I SAW THE GREAT BLACK DOME OF SAINT PAULS BULGING AT ME
FROM BEHIND A GRIM STONE BUILDING WHICH A BYSTANDER SAID WAS NEWGATE
PRISON FOLLOWING THE WALL OF THE JAIL I FOUND THE ROADWAY COVERED
WITH STRAW TO DEADEN THE NOISE OF PASSING VEHICLES AND FROM THIS AND
FROM THE QUANTITY OF PEOPLE STANDING ABOUT SMELLING STRONGLY OF SPIRITS
AND BEER I INFERRED THAT THE TRIALS WERE ON

WHILE I LOOKED ABOUT ME HERE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIRTY AND PARTIALLY DRUNK
MINISTER OF JUSTICE ASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE TO STEP IN AND HEAR A
TRIAL OR SO INFORMING ME THAT HE COULD GIVE ME A FRONT PLACE FOR HALF
A CROWN WHENCE I SHOULD COMMAND A FULL VIEW OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
IN HIS WIG AND ROBESMENTIONING THAT AWFUL PERSONAGE LIKE WAXWORK AND
PRESENTLY OFFERING HIM AT THE REDUCED PRICE OF EIGHTEENPENCE AS I
DECLINED THE PROPOSAL ON THE PLEA OF AN APPOINTMENT HE WAS SO GOOD AS
TO TAKE ME INTO A YARD AND SHOW ME WHERE THE GALLOWS WAS KEPT AND ALSO
WHERE PEOPLE WERE PUBLICLY WHIPPED AND THEN HE SHOWED ME THE DEBTORS
DOOR OUT OF WHICH CULPRITS CAME TO BE HANGED HEIGHTENING THE INTEREST
OF THAT DREADFUL PORTAL BY GIVING ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOUR ON EM
WOULD COME OUT AT THAT DOOR THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AT EIGHT IN THE
MORNING TO BE KILLED IN A ROW THIS WAS HORRIBLE AND GAVE ME A
SICKENING IDEA OF LONDON THE MORE SO AS THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICES
PROPRIETOR WORE FROM HIS HAT DOWN TO HIS BOOTS AND UP AGAIN TO HIS
POCKETHANDKERCHIEF INCLUSIVE MILDEWED CLOTHES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY NOT
BELONGED TO HIM ORIGINALLY AND WHICH I TOOK IT INTO MY HEAD HE HAD
BOUGHT CHEAP OF THE EXECUTIONER UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I THOUGHT
MYSELF WELL RID OF HIM FOR A SHILLING

I DROPPED INTO THE OFFICE TO ASK IF MR JAGGERS HAD COME IN YET AND I
FOUND HE HAD NOT AND I STROLLED OUT AGAIN THIS TIME I MADE THE TOUR
OF LITTLE BRITAIN AND TURNED INTO BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE AND NOW I BECAME
AWARE THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE WAITING ABOUT FOR MR JAGGERS AS WELL AS
I THERE WERE TWO MEN OF SECRET APPEARANCE LOUNGING IN BARTHOLOMEW
CLOSE AND THOUGHTFULLY FITTING THEIR FEET INTO THE CRACKS OF THE
PAVEMENT AS THEY TALKED TOGETHER ONE OF WHOM SAID TO THE OTHER WHEN
THEY FIRST PASSED ME THAT JAGGERS WOULD DO IT IF IT WAS TO BE DONE
THERE WAS A KNOT OF THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN STANDING AT A CORNER AND
ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS CRYING ON HER DIRTY SHAWL AND THE OTHER COMFORTED
HER BY SAYING AS SHE PULLED HER OWN SHAWL OVER HER SHOULDERS JAGGERS
IS FOR HIM MELIA AND WHAT MORE COULD YOU HAVE THERE WAS A
REDEYED LITTLE JEW WHO CAME INTO THE CLOSE WHILE I WAS LOITERING
THERE IN COMPANY WITH A SECOND LITTLE JEW WHOM HE SENT UPON AN ERRAND
AND WHILE THE MESSENGER WAS GONE I REMARKED THIS JEW WHO WAS OF A
HIGHLY EXCITABLE TEMPERAMENT PERFORMING A JIG OF ANXIETY UNDER A
LAMPPOST AND ACCOMPANYING HIMSELF IN A KIND OF FRENZY WITH THE
WORDS O JAGGERTH JAGGERTH JAGGERTH ALL OTHERTH ITH CAGMAGGERTH
GIVE ME JAGGERTH THESE TESTIMONIES TO THE POPULARITY OF MY GUARDIAN
MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME AND I ADMIRED AND WONDERED MORE THAN
EVER

AT LENGTH AS I WAS LOOKING OUT AT THE IRON GATE OF BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE
INTO LITTLE BRITAIN I SAW MR JAGGERS COMING ACROSS THE ROAD TOWARDS
ME ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE WAITING SAW HIM AT THE SAME TIME AND THERE
WAS QUITE A RUSH AT HIM MR JAGGERS PUTTING A HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND
WALKING ME ON AT HIS SIDE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO ME ADDRESSED
HIMSELF TO HIS FOLLOWERS

FIRST HE TOOK THE TWO SECRET MEN

NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU SAID MR JAGGERS THROWING HIS
FINGER AT THEM I WANT TO KNOW NO MORE THAN I KNOW AS TO THE RESULT
ITS A TOSSUP I TOLD YOU FROM THE FIRST IT WAS A TOSSUP HAVE YOU
PAID WEMMICK

WE MADE THE MONEY UP THIS MORNING SIR SAID ONE OF THE MEN
SUBMISSIVELY WHILE THE OTHER PERUSED MR JAGGERSS FACE

I DONT ASK YOU WHEN YOU MADE IT UP OR WHERE OR WHETHER YOU MADE IT
UP AT ALL HAS WEMMICK GOT IT

YES SIR SAID BOTH THE MEN TOGETHER

VERY WELL THEN YOU MAY GO NOW I WONT HAVE IT SAID MR JAGGERS
WAVING HIS HAND AT THEM TO PUT THEM BEHIND HIM IF YOU SAY A WORD TO
ME ILL THROW UP THE CASE

WE THOUGHT MR JAGGERS ONE OF THE MEN BEGAN PULLING OFF HIS HAT

THATS WHAT I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO SAID MR JAGGERS YOU THOUGHT I
THINK FOR YOU THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU IF I WANT YOU I KNOW WHERE TO
FIND YOU I DONT WANT YOU TO FIND ME NOW I WONT HAVE IT I WONT
HEAR A WORD

THE TWO MEN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AS MR JAGGERS WAVED THEM BEHIND
AGAIN AND HUMBLY FELL BACK AND WERE HEARD NO MORE

AND NOW YOU SAID MR JAGGERS SUDDENLY STOPPING AND TURNING ON
THE TWO WOMEN WITH THE SHAWLS FROM WHOM THE THREE MEN HAD MEEKLY
SEPARATEDOH AMELIA IS IT

YES MR JAGGERS

AND DO YOU REMEMBER RETORTED MR JAGGERS THAT BUT FOR ME YOU
WOULDNT BE HERE AND COULDNT BE HERE

O YES SIR EXCLAIMED BOTH WOMEN TOGETHER LORD BLESS YOU SIR WELL
WE KNOWS THAT

THEN WHY SAID MR JAGGERS DO YOU COME HERE

NOW I TELL YOU WHAT SAID MR JAGGERS ONCE FOR ALL IF YOU DONT
KNOW THAT YOUR BILLS IN GOOD HANDS I KNOW IT AND IF YOU COME HERE
BOTHERING ABOUT YOUR BILL ILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF BOTH YOUR BILL AND
YOU AND LET HIM SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS HAVE YOU PAID WEMMICK

O YES SIR EVERY FARDEN

VERY WELL THEN YOU HAVE DONE ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SAY ANOTHER
WORDONE SINGLE WORDAND WEMMICK SHALL GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK

THIS TERRIBLE THREAT CAUSED THE TWO WOMEN TO FALL OFF IMMEDIATELY NO
ONE REMAINED NOW BUT THE EXCITABLE JEW WHO HAD ALREADY RAISED THE
SKIRTS OF MR JAGGERSS COAT TO HIS LIPS SEVERAL TIMES

I DONT KNOW THIS MAN SAID MR JAGGERS IN THE SAME DEVASTATING
STRAIN WHAT DOES THIS FELLOW WANT

MA THEAR MITHTER JAGGERTH HOWN BROTHER TO HABRAHAM LATHARUTH

WHOS HE SAID MR JAGGERS LET GO OF MY COAT

THE SUITOR KISSING THE HEM OF THE GARMENT AGAIN BEFORE RELINQUISHING

MY GUARDIAN THREW HIS SUPPLICANT OFF WITH SUPREME INDIFFERENCE AND
LEFT HIM DANCING ON THE PAVEMENT AS IF IT WERE RED HOT WITHOUT FURTHER
INTERRUPTION WE REACHED THE FRONT OFFICE WHERE WE FOUND THE CLERK AND
THE MAN IN VELVETEEN WITH THE FUR CAP

HERES MIKE SAID THE CLERK GETTING DOWN FROM HIS STOOL AND
APPROACHING MR JAGGERS CONFIDENTIALLY

OH SAID MR JAGGERS TURNING TO THE MAN WHO WAS PULLING A LOCK OF
HAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FOREHEAD LIKE THE BULL IN COCK ROBIN PULLING
AT THE BELLROPE YOUR MAN COMES ON THIS AFTERNOON WELL

WELL MASR JAGGERS RETURNED MIKE IN THE VOICE OF A SUFFERER FROM A
CONSTITUTIONAL COLD ARTER A DEAL O TROUBLE IVE FOUND ONE SIR AS
MIGHT DO

WHAT IS HE PREPARED TO SWEAR

WELL MASR JAGGERS SAID MIKE WIPING HIS NOSE ON HIS FUR CAP THIS
TIME IN A GENERAL WAY ANYTHINK

MR JAGGERS SUDDENLY BECAME MOST IRATE NOW I WARNED YOU BEFORE
SAID HE THROWING HIS FOREFINGER AT THE TERRIFIED CLIENT THAT IF YOU
EVER PRESUMED TO TALK IN THAT WAY HERE ID MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF YOU YOU
INFERNAL SCOUNDREL HOW DARE YOU TELL ME THAT

THE CLIENT LOOKED SCARED BUT BEWILDERED TOO AS IF HE WERE UNCONSCIOUS
WHAT HE HAD DONE

SPOONEY SAID THE CLERK IN A LOW VOICE GIVING HIM A STIR WITH HIS
ELBOW SOFT HEAD NEED YOU SAY IT FACE TO FACE

NOW I ASK YOU YOU BLUNDERING BOOBY SAID MY GUARDIAN VERY STERNLY
ONCE MORE AND FOR THE LAST TIME WHAT THE MAN YOU HAVE BROUGHT HERE IS
PREPARED TO SWEAR

MIKE LOOKED HARD AT MY GUARDIAN AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO LEARN A LESSON
FROM HIS FACE AND SLOWLY REPLIED AYTHER TO CHARACTER OR TO HAVING
BEEN IN HIS COMPANY AND NEVER LEFT HIM ALL THE NIGHT IN QUESTION

NOW BE CAREFUL IN WHAT STATION OF LIFE IS THIS MAN

MIKE LOOKED AT HIS CAP AND LOOKED AT THE FLOOR AND LOOKED AT THE
CEILING AND LOOKED AT THE CLERK AND EVEN LOOKED AT ME BEFORE
BEGINNING TO REPLY IN A NERVOUS MANNER WEVE DRESSED HIM UP LIKE
WHEN MY GUARDIAN BLUSTERED OUT

WHAT YOU WILL WILL YOU

SPOONEY ADDED THE CLERK AGAIN WITH ANOTHER STIR

AFTER SOME HELPLESS CASTING ABOUT MIKE BRIGHTENED AND BEGAN AGAIN

HE IS DRESSED LIKE A SPECTABLE PIEMAN A SORT OF A PASTRYCOOK

IS HE HERE ASKED MY GUARDIAN

I LEFT HIM SAID MIKE A SETTING ON SOME DOORSTEPS ROUND THE
CORNER

TAKE HIM PAST THAT WINDOW AND LET ME SEE HIM

THE WINDOW INDICATED WAS THE OFFICE WINDOW WE ALL THREE WENT TO IT
BEHIND THE WIRE BLIND AND PRESENTLY SAW THE CLIENT GO BY IN AN
ACCIDENTAL MANNER WITH A MURDEROUSLOOKING TALL INDIVIDUAL IN A SHORT
SUIT OF WHITE LINEN AND A PAPER CAP THIS GUILELESS CONFECTIONER WAS
NOT BY ANY MEANS SOBER AND HAD A BLACK EYE IN THE GREEN STAGE OF
RECOVERY WHICH WAS PAINTED OVER

TELL HIM TO TAKE HIS WITNESS AWAY DIRECTLY SAID MY GUARDIAN TO THE
CLERK IN EXTREME DISGUST AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANS BY BRINGING SUCH
A FELLOW AS THAT

MY GUARDIAN THEN TOOK ME INTO HIS OWN ROOM AND WHILE HE LUNCHED
STANDING FROM A SANDWICHBOX AND A POCKETFLASK OF SHERRY HE SEEMED
TO BULLY HIS VERY SANDWICH AS HE ATE IT INFORMED ME WHAT ARRANGEMENTS
HE HAD MADE FOR ME I WAS TO GO TO BARNARDS INN TO YOUNG MR
POCKETS ROOMS WHERE A BED HAD BEEN SENT IN FOR MY ACCOMMODATION I
WAS TO REMAIN WITH YOUNG MR POCKET UNTIL MONDAY ON MONDAY I WAS TO GO
WITH HIM TO HIS FATHERS HOUSE ON A VISIT THAT I MIGHT TRY HOW I LIKED
IT ALSO I WAS TOLD WHAT MY ALLOWANCE WAS TO BEIT WAS A VERY LIBERAL
ONEAND HAD HANDED TO ME FROM ONE OF MY GUARDIANS DRAWERS THE CARDS
OF CERTAIN TRADESMEN WITH WHOM I WAS TO DEAL FOR ALL KINDS OF CLOTHES
AND SUCH OTHER THINGS AS I COULD IN REASON WANT YOU WILL FIND YOUR
CREDIT GOOD MR PIP SAID MY GUARDIAN WHOSE FLASK OF SHERRY SMELT
LIKE A WHOLE CASKFUL AS HE HASTILY REFRESHED HIMSELF BUT I SHALL BY
THIS MEANS BE ABLE TO CHECK YOUR BILLS AND TO PULL YOU UP IF I FIND
YOU OUTRUNNING THE CONSTABLE OF COURSE YOULL GO WRONG SOMEHOW BUT
THATS NO FAULT OF MINE

AFTER I HAD PONDERED A LITTLE OVER THIS ENCOURAGING SENTIMENT I ASKED
MR JAGGERS IF I COULD SEND FOR A COACH HE SAID IT WAS NOT WORTH
WHILE I WAS SO NEAR MY DESTINATION WEMMICK SHOULD WALK ROUND WITH ME
IF I PLEASED

I THEN FOUND THAT WEMMICK WAS THE CLERK IN THE NEXT ROOM ANOTHER CLERK
WAS RUNG DOWN FROM UPSTAIRS TO TAKE HIS PLACE WHILE HE WAS OUT AND I
ACCOMPANIED HIM INTO THE STREET AFTER SHAKING HANDS WITH MY GUARDIAN
WE FOUND A NEW SET OF PEOPLE LINGERING OUTSIDE BUT WEMMICK MADE A WAY
AMONG THEM BY SAYING COOLLY YET DECISIVELY I TELL YOU ITS NO USE HE
WONT HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO ONE OF YOU AND WE SOON GOT CLEAR OF THEM
AND WENT ON SIDE BY SIDE




CHAPTER XXI


CASTING MY EYES ON MR WEMMICK AS WE WENT ALONG TO SEE WHAT HE WAS
LIKE IN THE LIGHT OF DAY I FOUND HIM TO BE A DRY MAN RATHER SHORT IN
STATURE WITH A SQUARE WOODEN FACE WHOSE EXPRESSION SEEMED TO HAVE
BEEN IMPERFECTLY CHIPPED OUT WITH A DULLEDGED CHISEL THERE WERE SOME
MARKS IN IT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIMPLES IF THE MATERIAL HAD BEEN
SOFTER AND THE INSTRUMENT FINER BUT WHICH AS IT WAS WERE ONLY DINTS
THE CHISEL HAD MADE THREE OR FOUR OF THESE ATTEMPTS AT EMBELLISHMENT
OVER HIS NOSE BUT HAD GIVEN THEM UP WITHOUT AN EFFORT TO SMOOTH THEM
OFF I JUDGED HIM TO BE A BACHELOR FROM THE FRAYED CONDITION OF HIS
LINEN AND HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUSTAINED A GOOD MANY BEREAVEMENTS FOR
HE WORE AT LEAST FOUR MOURNING RINGS BESIDES A BROOCH REPRESENTING A
LADY AND A WEEPING WILLOW AT A TOMB WITH AN URN ON IT I NOTICED TOO
THAT SEVERAL RINGS AND SEALS HUNG AT HIS WATCHCHAIN AS IF HE WERE
QUITE LADEN WITH REMEMBRANCES OF DEPARTED FRIENDS HE HAD GLITTERING
EYESSMALL KEEN AND BLACKAND THIN WIDE MOTTLED LIPS HE HAD HAD
THEM TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF FROM FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS

SO YOU WERE NEVER IN LONDON BEFORE SAID MR WEMMICK TO ME

NO SAID I

I WAS NEW HERE ONCE SAID MR WEMMICK RUM TO THINK OF NOW

YOU ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH IT NOW

WHY YES SAID MR WEMMICK I KNOW THE MOVES OF IT

IS IT A VERY WICKED PLACE I ASKED MORE FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING
SOMETHING THAN FOR INFORMATION

YOU MAY GET CHEATED ROBBED AND MURDERED IN LONDON BUT THERE ARE
PLENTY OF PEOPLE ANYWHERE WHOLL DO THAT FOR YOU

IF THERE IS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN YOU AND THEM SAID I TO SOFTEN IT OFF
A LITTLE

O I DONT KNOW ABOUT BAD BLOOD RETURNED MR WEMMICK THERES NOT
MUCH BAD BLOOD ABOUT THEYLL DO IT IF THERES ANYTHING TO BE GOT BY
IT

THAT MAKES IT WORSE

YOU THINK SO RETURNED MR WEMMICK MUCH ABOUT THE SAME I SHOULD
SAY

HE WORE HIS HAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE
HIM WALKING IN A SELFCONTAINED WAY AS IF THERE WERE NOTHING IN THE
STREETS TO CLAIM HIS ATTENTION HIS MOUTH WAS SUCH A POSTOFFICE OF A
MOUTH THAT HE HAD A MECHANICAL APPEARANCE OF SMILING WE HAD GOT TO THE
TOP OF HOLBORN HILL BEFORE I KNEW THAT IT WAS MERELY A MECHANICAL
APPEARANCE AND THAT HE WAS NOT SMILING AT ALL

DO YOU KNOW WHERE MR MATTHEW POCKET LIVES I ASKED MR WEMMICK

YES SAID HE NODDING IN THE DIRECTION AT HAMMERSMITH WEST OF
LONDON

IS THAT FAR

WELL SAY FIVE MILES

DO YOU KNOW HIM

WHY YOURE A REGULAR CROSSEXAMINER SAID MR WEMMICK LOOKING AT ME
WITH AN APPROVING AIR YES I KNOW HIM I KNOW HIM

THERE WAS AN AIR OF TOLERATION OR DEPRECIATION ABOUT HIS UTTERANCE OF
THESE WORDS THAT RATHER DEPRESSED ME AND I WAS STILL LOOKING SIDEWAYS
AT HIS BLOCK OF A FACE IN SEARCH OF ANY ENCOURAGING NOTE TO THE TEXT
WHEN HE SAID HERE WE WERE AT BARNARDS INN MY DEPRESSION WAS NOT
ALLEVIATED BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR I HAD SUPPOSED THAT ESTABLISHMENT
TO BE AN HOTEL KEPT BY MR BARNARD TO WHICH THE BLUE BOAR IN OUR TOWN
WAS A MERE PUBLICHOUSE WHEREAS I NOW FOUND BARNARD TO BE A
DISEMBODIED SPIRIT OR A FICTION AND HIS INN THE DINGIEST COLLECTION
OF SHABBY BUILDINGS EVER SQUEEZED TOGETHER IN A RANK CORNER AS A CLUB
FOR TOMCATS

WE ENTERED THIS HAVEN THROUGH A WICKETGATE AND WERE DISGORGED BY AN
INTRODUCTORY PASSAGE INTO A MELANCHOLY LITTLE SQUARE THAT LOOKED TO ME
LIKE A FLAT BURYINGGROUND I THOUGHT IT HAD THE MOST DISMAL TREES IN
IT AND THE MOST DISMAL SPARROWS AND THE MOST DISMAL CATS AND THE
MOST DISMAL HOUSES IN NUMBER HALF A DOZEN OR SO THAT I HAD EVER
SEEN I THOUGHT THE WINDOWS OF THE SETS OF CHAMBERS INTO WHICH THOSE
HOUSES WERE DIVIDED WERE IN EVERY STAGE OF DILAPIDATED BLIND AND
CURTAIN CRIPPLED FLOWERPOT CRACKED GLASS DUSTY DECAY AND MISERABLE
MAKESHIFT WHILE TO LET TO LET TO LET GLARED AT ME FROM EMPTY ROOMS
AS IF NO NEW WRETCHES EVER CAME THERE AND THE VENGEANCE OF THE SOUL OF
BARNARD WERE BEING SLOWLY APPEASED BY THE GRADUAL SUICIDE OF THE
PRESENT OCCUPANTS AND THEIR UNHOLY INTERMENT UNDER THE GRAVEL A FROWZY
MOURNING OF SOOT AND SMOKE ATTIRED THIS FORLORN CREATION OF BARNARD
AND IT HAD STREWN ASHES ON ITS HEAD AND WAS UNDERGOING PENANCE AND
HUMILIATION AS A MERE DUSTHOLE THUS FAR MY SENSE OF SIGHT WHILE DRY
ROT AND WET ROT AND ALL THE SILENT ROTS THAT ROT IN NEGLECTED ROOF AND
CELLARROT OF RAT AND MOUSE AND BUG AND COACHINGSTABLES NEAR AT HAND
BESIDESADDRESSED THEMSELVES FAINTLY TO MY SENSE OF SMELL AND MOANED
TRY BARNARDS MIXTURE

SO IMPERFECT WAS THIS REALISATION OF THE FIRST OF MY GREAT
EXPECTATIONS THAT I LOOKED IN DISMAY AT MR WEMMICK AH SAID HE
MISTAKING ME THE RETIREMENT REMINDS YOU OF THE COUNTRY SO IT DOES
ME

HE LED ME INTO A CORNER AND CONDUCTED ME UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRSWHICH
APPEARED TO ME TO BE SLOWLY COLLAPSING INTO SAWDUST SO THAT ONE OF
THOSE DAYS THE UPPER LODGERS WOULD LOOK OUT AT THEIR DOORS AND FIND
THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE MEANS OF COMING DOWNTO A SET OF CHAMBERS ON
THE TOP FLOOR MR POCKET JUN WAS PAINTED ON THE DOOR AND THERE WAS
A LABEL ON THE LETTERBOX RETURN SHORTLY

HE HARDLY THOUGHT YOUD COME SO SOON MR WEMMICK EXPLAINED YOU
DONT WANT ME ANY MORE

NO THANK YOU SAID I

AS I KEEP THE CASH MR WEMMICK OBSERVED WE SHALL MOST LIKELY MEET
PRETTY OFTEN GOOD DAY

GOOD DAY

I PUT OUT MY HAND AND MR WEMMICK AT FIRST LOOKED AT IT AS IF HE
THOUGHT I WANTED SOMETHING THEN HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID CORRECTING
HIMSELF

TO BE SURE YES YOURE IN THE HABIT OF SHAKING HANDS

I WAS RATHER CONFUSED THINKING IT MUST BE OUT OF THE LONDON FASHION
BUT SAID YES

I HAVE GOT SO OUT OF IT SAID MR WEMMICKEXCEPT AT LAST VERY
GLAD IM SURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE GOOD DAY

WHEN WE HAD SHAKEN HANDS AND HE WAS GONE I OPENED THE STAIRCASE WINDOW
AND HAD NEARLY BEHEADED MYSELF FOR THE LINES HAD ROTTED AWAY AND IT
CAME DOWN LIKE THE GUILLOTINE HAPPILY IT WAS SO QUICK THAT I HAD NOT
PUT MY HEAD OUT AFTER THIS ESCAPE I WAS CONTENT TO TAKE A FOGGY VIEW
OF THE INN THROUGH THE WINDOWS ENCRUSTING DIRT AND TO STAND DOLEFULLY
LOOKING OUT SAYING TO MYSELF THAT LONDON WAS DECIDEDLY OVERRATED

MR POCKET JUNIORS IDEA OF SHORTLY WAS NOT MINE FOR I HAD NEARLY
MADDENED MYSELF WITH LOOKING OUT FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HAD WRITTEN MY
NAME WITH MY FINGER SEVERAL TIMES IN THE DIRT OF EVERY PANE IN THE
WINDOW BEFORE I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS GRADUALLY THERE AROSE
BEFORE ME THE HAT HEAD NECKCLOTH WAISTCOAT TROUSERS BOOTS OF A
MEMBER OF SOCIETY OF ABOUT MY OWN STANDING HE HAD A PAPERBAG UNDER
EACH ARM AND A POTTLE OF STRAWBERRIES IN ONE HAND AND WAS OUT OF
BREATH

MR PIP SAID HE

MR POCKET SAID I

DEAR ME HE EXCLAIMED I AM EXTREMELY SORRY BUT I KNEW THERE WAS A
COACH FROM YOUR PART OF THE COUNTRY AT MIDDAY AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
COME BY THAT ONE THE FACT IS I HAVE BEEN OUT ON YOUR ACCOUNTNOT
THAT THAT IS ANY EXCUSEFOR I THOUGHT COMING FROM THE COUNTRY YOU
MIGHT LIKE A LITTLE FRUIT AFTER DINNER AND I WENT TO COVENT GARDEN
MARKET TO GET IT GOOD

FOR A REASON THAT I HAD I FELT AS IF MY EYES WOULD START OUT OF MY
HEAD I ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ATTENTION INCOHERENTLY AND BEGAN TO THINK
THIS WAS A DREAM

DEAR ME SAID MR POCKET JUNIOR THIS DOOR STICKS SO

AS HE WAS FAST MAKING JAM OF HIS FRUIT BY WRESTLING WITH THE DOOR WHILE
THE PAPERBAGS WERE UNDER HIS ARMS I BEGGED HIM TO ALLOW ME TO HOLD
THEM HE RELINQUISHED THEM WITH AN AGREEABLE SMILE AND COMBATED WITH
THE DOOR AS IF IT WERE A WILD BEAST IT YIELDED SO SUDDENLY AT LAST
THAT HE STAGGERED BACK UPON ME AND I STAGGERED BACK UPON THE OPPOSITE
DOOR AND WE BOTH LAUGHED BUT STILL I FELT AS IF MY EYES MUST START
OUT OF MY HEAD AND AS IF THIS MUST BE A DREAM

PRAY COME IN SAID MR POCKET JUNIOR ALLOW ME TO LEAD THE WAY I
AM RATHER BARE HERE BUT I HOPE YOULL BE ABLE TO MAKE OUT TOLERABLY
WELL TILL MONDAY MY FATHER THOUGHT YOU WOULD GET ON MORE AGREEABLY
THROUGH TOMORROW WITH ME THAN WITH HIM AND MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE A WALK
ABOUT LONDON I AM SURE I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO SHOW LONDON TO YOU AS
TO OUR TABLE YOU WONT FIND THAT BAD I HOPE FOR IT WILL BE SUPPLIED
FROM OUR COFFEEHOUSE HERE AND IT IS ONLY RIGHT I SHOULD ADD AT YOUR
EXPENSE SUCH BEING MR JAGGERSS DIRECTIONS AS TO OUR LODGING ITS
NOT BY ANY MEANS SPLENDID BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN BREAD TO EARN AND MY
FATHER HASNT ANYTHING TO GIVE ME AND I SHOULDNT BE WILLING TO TAKE
IT IF HE HAD THIS IS OUR SITTINGROOMJUST SUCH CHAIRS AND TABLES
AND CARPET AND SO FORTH YOU SEE AS THEY COULD SPARE FROM HOME YOU
MUSTNT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THE TABLECLOTH AND SPOONS AND CASTORS
BECAUSE THEY COME FOR YOU FROM THE COFFEEHOUSE THIS IS MY LITTLE
BEDROOM RATHER MUSTY BUT BARNARDS IS MUSTY THIS IS YOUR BEDROOM
THE FURNITURES HIRED FOR THE OCCASION BUT I TRUST IT WILL ANSWER THE
PURPOSE IF YOU SHOULD WANT ANYTHING ILL GO AND FETCH IT THE
CHAMBERS ARE RETIRED AND WE SHALL BE ALONE TOGETHER BUT WE SHANT
FIGHT I DARE SAY BUT DEAR ME I BEG YOUR PARDON YOURE HOLDING THE
FRUIT ALL THIS TIME PRAY LET ME TAKE THESE BAGS FROM YOU I AM QUITE
ASHAMED

AS I STOOD OPPOSITE TO MR POCKET JUNIOR DELIVERING HIM THE BAGS
ONE TWO I SAW THE STARTING APPEARANCE COME INTO HIS OWN EYES THAT I
KNEW TO BE IN MINE AND HE SAID FALLING BACK

LORD BLESS ME YOURE THE PROWLING BOY

AND YOU SAID I ARE THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN




CHAPTER XXII


THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND I STOOD CONTEMPLATING ONE ANOTHER IN
BARNARDS INN UNTIL WE BOTH BURST OUT LAUGHING THE IDEA OF ITS BEING
YOU SAID HE THE IDEA OF ITS BEING YOU SAID I AND THEN WE
CONTEMPLATED ONE ANOTHER AFRESH AND LAUGHED AGAIN WELL SAID THE
PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN REACHING OUT HIS HAND GOODHUMOUREDLY ITS ALL
OVER NOW I HOPE AND IT WILL BE MAGNANIMOUS IN YOU IF YOULL FORGIVE
ME FOR HAVING KNOCKED YOU ABOUT SO

I DERIVED FROM THIS SPEECH THAT MR HERBERT POCKET FOR HERBERT WAS THE
PALE YOUNG GENTLEMANS NAME STILL RATHER CONFOUNDED HIS INTENTION WITH
HIS EXECUTION BUT I MADE A MODEST REPLY AND WE SHOOK HANDS WARMLY

YOU HADNT COME INTO YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AT THAT TIME SAID HERBERT
POCKET

NO SAID I

NO HE ACQUIESCED I HEARD IT HAD HAPPENED VERY LATELY I WAS
RATHER ON THE LOOKOUT FOR GOOD FORTUNE THEN

INDEED

YES MISS HAVISHAM HAD SENT FOR ME TO SEE IF SHE COULD TAKE A FANCY
TO ME BUT SHE COULDNTAT ALL EVENTS SHE DIDNT

I THOUGHT IT POLITE TO REMARK THAT I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT

BAD TASTE SAID HERBERT LAUGHING BUT A FACT YES SHE HAD SENT FOR
ME ON A TRIAL VISIT AND IF I HAD COME OUT OF IT SUCCESSFULLY I
SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WHATYOUMAYCALLED IT TO ESTELLA

WHATS THAT I ASKED WITH SUDDEN GRAVITY

HE WAS ARRANGING HIS FRUIT IN PLATES WHILE WE TALKED WHICH DIVIDED HIS
ATTENTION AND WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS HAVING MADE THIS LAPSE OF A WORD
AFFIANCED HE EXPLAINED STILL BUSY WITH THE FRUIT BETROTHED
ENGAGED WHATSHISNAMED ANY WORD OF THAT SORT

HOW DID YOU BEAR YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT I ASKED

POOH SAID HE I DIDNT CARE MUCH FOR IT SHES A TARTAR

MISS HAVISHAM

I DONT SAY NO TO THAT BUT I MEANT ESTELLA THAT GIRLS HARD AND
HAUGHTY AND CAPRICIOUS TO THE LAST DEGREE AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP BY
MISS HAVISHAM TO WREAK REVENGE ON ALL THE MALE SEX

WHAT RELATION IS SHE TO MISS HAVISHAM

NONE SAID HE ONLY ADOPTED

WHY SHOULD SHE WREAK REVENGE ON ALL THE MALE SEX WHAT REVENGE

LORD MR PIP SAID HE DONT YOU KNOW

NO SAID I

DEAR ME ITS QUITE A STORY AND SHALL BE SAVED TILL DINNERTIME AND
NOW LET ME TAKE THE LIBERTY OF ASKING YOU A QUESTION HOW DID YOU COME
THERE THAT DAY

I TOLD HIM AND HE WAS ATTENTIVE UNTIL I HAD FINISHED AND THEN BURST
OUT LAUGHING AGAIN AND ASKED ME IF I WAS SORE AFTERWARDS I DIDNT ASK
HIM IF HE WAS FOR MY CONVICTION ON THAT POINT WAS PERFECTLY
ESTABLISHED

MR JAGGERS IS YOUR GUARDIAN I UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON

YES

YOU KNOW HE IS MISS HAVISHAMS MAN OF BUSINESS AND SOLICITOR AND HAS
HER CONFIDENCE WHEN NOBODY ELSE HAS

THIS WAS BRINGING ME I FELT TOWARDS DANGEROUS GROUND I ANSWERED WITH
A CONSTRAINT I MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE THAT I HAD SEEN MR JAGGERS
IN MISS HAVISHAMS HOUSE ON THE VERY DAY OF OUR COMBAT BUT NEVER AT
ANY OTHER TIME AND THAT I BELIEVED HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HAVING
EVER SEEN ME THERE

HE WAS SO OBLIGING AS TO SUGGEST MY FATHER FOR YOUR TUTOR AND HE
CALLED ON MY FATHER TO PROPOSE IT OF COURSE HE KNEW ABOUT MY FATHER
FROM HIS CONNECTION WITH MISS HAVISHAM MY FATHER IS MISS HAVISHAMS
COUSIN NOT THAT THAT IMPLIES FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THEM FOR HE
IS A BAD COURTIER AND WILL NOT PROPITIATE HER

HERBERT POCKET HAD A FRANK AND EASY WAY WITH HIM THAT WAS VERY TAKING
I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE THEN AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY ONE SINCE WHO
MORE STRONGLY EXPRESSED TO ME IN EVERY LOOK AND TONE A NATURAL
INCAPACITY TO DO ANYTHING SECRET AND MEAN THERE WAS SOMETHING
WONDERFULLY HOPEFUL ABOUT HIS GENERAL AIR AND SOMETHING THAT AT THE
SAME TIME WHISPERED TO ME HE WOULD NEVER BE VERY SUCCESSFUL OR RICH I
DONT KNOW HOW THIS WAS I BECAME IMBUED WITH THE NOTION ON THAT FIRST
OCCASION BEFORE WE SAT DOWN TO DINNER BUT I CANNOT DEFINE BY WHAT
MEANS

HE WAS STILL A PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND HAD A CERTAIN CONQUERED
LANGUOR ABOUT HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS SPIRITS AND BRISKNESS THAT DID
NOT SEEM INDICATIVE OF NATURAL STRENGTH HE HAD NOT A HANDSOME FACE
BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN HANDSOME BEING EXTREMELY AMIABLE AND CHEERFUL
HIS FIGURE WAS A LITTLE UNGAINLY AS IN THE DAYS WHEN MY KNUCKLES HAD
TAKEN SUCH LIBERTIES WITH IT BUT IT LOOKED AS IF IT WOULD ALWAYS BE
LIGHT AND YOUNG WHETHER MR TRABBS LOCAL WORK WOULD HAVE SAT MORE
GRACEFULLY ON HIM THAN ON ME MAY BE A QUESTION BUT I AM CONSCIOUS
THAT HE CARRIED OFF HIS RATHER OLD CLOTHES MUCH BETTER THAN I CARRIED
OFF MY NEW SUIT

AS HE WAS SO COMMUNICATIVE I FELT THAT RESERVE ON MY PART WOULD BE A
BAD RETURN UNSUITED TO OUR YEARS I THEREFORE TOLD HIM MY SMALL STORY
AND LAID STRESS ON MY BEING FORBIDDEN TO INQUIRE WHO MY BENEFACTOR WAS
I FURTHER MENTIONED THAT AS I HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP A BLACKSMITH IN A
COUNTRY PLACE AND KNEW VERY LITTLE OF THE WAYS OF POLITENESS I WOULD
TAKE IT AS A GREAT KINDNESS IN HIM IF HE WOULD GIVE ME A HINT WHENEVER
HE SAW ME AT A LOSS OR GOING WRONG

WITH PLEASURE SAID HE THOUGH I VENTURE TO PROPHESY THAT YOULL
WANT VERY FEW HINTS I DARE SAY WE SHALL BE OFTEN TOGETHER AND I
SHOULD LIKE TO BANISH ANY NEEDLESS RESTRAINT BETWEEN US WILL YOU DO ME
THE FAVOUR TO BEGIN AT ONCE TO CALL ME BY MY CHRISTIAN NAME HERBERT

I THANKED HIM AND SAID I WOULD I INFORMED HIM IN EXCHANGE THAT MY
CHRISTIAN NAME WAS PHILIP

I DONT TAKE TO PHILIP SAID HE SMILING FOR IT SOUNDS LIKE A MORAL
BOY OUT OF THE SPELLINGBOOK WHO WAS SO LAZY THAT HE FELL INTO A POND
OR SO FAT THAT HE COULDNT SEE OUT OF HIS EYES OR SO AVARICIOUS THAT
HE LOCKED UP HIS CAKE TILL THE MICE ATE IT OR SO DETERMINED TO GO A
BIRDSNESTING THAT HE GOT HIMSELF EATEN BY BEARS WHO LIVED HANDY IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I TELL YOU WHAT I SHOULD LIKE WE ARE SO HARMONIOUS
AND YOU HAVE BEEN A BLACKSMITHWOULD YOU MIND IT

I SHOULDNT MIND ANYTHING THAT YOU PROPOSE I ANSWERED BUT I DONT
UNDERSTAND YOU

WOULD YOU MIND HANDEL FOR A FAMILIAR NAME THERES A CHARMING PIECE OF
MUSIC BY HANDEL CALLED THE HARMONIOUS BLACKSMITH

I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH

THEN MY DEAR HANDEL SAID HE TURNING ROUND AS THE DOOR OPENED
HERE IS THE DINNER AND I MUST BEG OF YOU TO TAKE THE TOP OF THE
TABLE BECAUSE THE DINNER IS OF YOUR PROVIDING

THIS I WOULD NOT HEAR OF SO HE TOOK THE TOP AND I FACED HIM IT WAS A
NICE LITTLE DINNERSEEMED TO ME THEN A VERY LORD MAYORS FEASTAND IT
ACQUIRED ADDITIONAL RELISH FROM BEING EATEN UNDER THOSE INDEPENDENT
CIRCUMSTANCES WITH NO OLD PEOPLE BY AND WITH LONDON ALL AROUND US
THIS AGAIN WAS HEIGHTENED BY A CERTAIN GYPSY CHARACTER THAT SET THE
BANQUET OFF FOR WHILE THE TABLE WAS AS MR PUMBLECHOOK MIGHT HAVE
SAID THE LAP OF LUXURYBEING ENTIRELY FURNISHED FORTH FROM THE
COFFEEHOUSETHE CIRCUMJACENT REGION OF SITTINGROOM WAS OF A
COMPARATIVELY PASTURELESS AND SHIFTY CHARACTER IMPOSING ON THE WAITER
THE WANDERING HABITS OF PUTTING THE COVERS ON THE FLOOR WHERE HE FELL
OVER THEM THE MELTED BUTTER IN THE ARMCHAIR THE BREAD ON THE
BOOKSHELVES THE CHEESE IN THE COALSCUTTLE AND THE BOILED FOWL INTO
MY BED IN THE NEXT ROOMWHERE I FOUND MUCH OF ITS PARSLEY AND BUTTER
IN A STATE OF CONGELATION WHEN I RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT ALL THIS MADE
THE FEAST DELIGHTFUL AND WHEN THE WAITER WAS NOT THERE TO WATCH ME MY
PLEASURE WAS WITHOUT ALLOY

WE HAD MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THE DINNER WHEN I REMINDED HERBERT OF HIS
PROMISE TO TELL ME ABOUT MISS HAVISHAM

TRUE HE REPLIED ILL REDEEM IT AT ONCE LET ME INTRODUCE THE
TOPIC HANDEL BY MENTIONING THAT IN LONDON IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM TO PUT
THE KNIFE IN THE MOUTHFOR FEAR OF ACCIDENTSAND THAT WHILE THE FORK
IS RESERVED FOR THAT USE IT IS NOT PUT FURTHER IN THAN NECESSARY IT
IS SCARCELY WORTH MENTIONING ONLY ITS AS WELL TO DO AS OTHER PEOPLE
DO ALSO THE SPOON IS NOT GENERALLY USED OVERHAND BUT UNDER THIS
HAS TWO ADVANTAGES YOU GET AT YOUR MOUTH BETTER WHICH AFTER ALL IS
THE OBJECT AND YOU SAVE A GOOD DEAL OF THE ATTITUDE OF OPENING
OYSTERS ON THE PART OF THE RIGHT ELBOW

HE OFFERED THESE FRIENDLY SUGGESTIONS IN SUCH A LIVELY WAY THAT WE
BOTH LAUGHED AND I SCARCELY BLUSHED

NOW HE PURSUED CONCERNING MISS HAVISHAM MISS HAVISHAM YOU MUST
KNOW WAS A SPOILT CHILD HER MOTHER DIED WHEN SHE WAS A BABY AND HER
FATHER DENIED HER NOTHING HER FATHER WAS A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN DOWN IN
YOUR PART OF THE WORLD AND WAS A BREWER I DONT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE
A CRACK THING TO BE A BREWER BUT IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT WHILE YOU
CANNOT POSSIBLY BE GENTEEL AND BAKE YOU MAY BE AS GENTEEL AS NEVER WAS
AND BREW YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY

YET A GENTLEMAN MAY NOT KEEP A PUBLICHOUSE MAY HE SAID I

NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT RETURNED HERBERT BUT A PUBLICHOUSE MAY KEEP A
GENTLEMAN WELL MR HAVISHAM WAS VERY RICH AND VERY PROUD SO WAS HIS
DAUGHTER

MISS HAVISHAM WAS AN ONLY CHILD I HAZARDED

STOP A MOMENT I AM COMING TO THAT NO SHE WAS NOT AN ONLY CHILD SHE
HAD A HALFBROTHER HER FATHER PRIVATELY MARRIED AGAINHIS COOK I
RATHER THINK

I THOUGHT HE WAS PROUD SAID I

MY GOOD HANDEL SO HE WAS HE MARRIED HIS SECOND WIFE PRIVATELY
BECAUSE HE WAS PROUD AND IN COURSE OF TIME SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS
DEAD I APPREHEND HE FIRST TOLD HIS DAUGHTER WHAT HE HAD DONE AND THEN
THE SON BECAME A PART OF THE FAMILY RESIDING IN THE HOUSE YOU ARE
ACQUAINTED WITH AS THE SON GREW A YOUNG MAN HE TURNED OUT RIOTOUS
EXTRAVAGANT UNDUTIFULALTOGETHER BAD AT LAST HIS FATHER DISINHERITED
HIM BUT HE SOFTENED WHEN HE WAS DYING AND LEFT HIM WELL OFF THOUGH
NOT NEARLY SO WELL OFF AS MISS HAVISHAMTAKE ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE
AND EXCUSE MY MENTIONING THAT SOCIETY AS A BODY DOES NOT EXPECT ONE TO
BE SO STRICTLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN EMPTYING ONES GLASS AS TO TURN IT
BOTTOM UPWARDS WITH THE RIM ON ONES NOSE

I HAD BEEN DOING THIS IN AN EXCESS OF ATTENTION TO HIS RECITAL I
THANKED HIM AND APOLOGISED HE SAID NOT AT ALL AND RESUMED

MISS HAVISHAM WAS NOW AN HEIRESS AND YOU MAY SUPPOSE WAS LOOKED AFTER
AS A GREAT MATCH HER HALFBROTHER HAD NOW AMPLE MEANS AGAIN BUT WHAT
WITH DEBTS AND WHAT WITH NEW MADNESS WASTED THEM MOST FEARFULLY AGAIN
THERE WERE STRONGER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIM AND HER THAN THERE HAD BEEN
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FATHER AND IT IS SUSPECTED THAT HE CHERISHED A
DEEP AND MORTAL GRUDGE AGAINST HER AS HAVING INFLUENCED THE FATHERS
ANGER NOW I COME TO THE CRUEL PART OF THE STORYMERELY BREAKING OFF
MY DEAR HANDEL TO REMARK THAT A DINNERNAPKIN WILL NOT GO INTO A
TUMBLER

WHY I WAS TRYING TO PACK MINE INTO MY TUMBLER I AM WHOLLY UNABLE TO
SAY I ONLY KNOW THAT I FOUND MYSELF WITH A PERSEVERANCE WORTHY OF A
MUCH BETTER CAUSE MAKING THE MOST STRENUOUS EXERTIONS TO COMPRESS IT
WITHIN THOSE LIMITS AGAIN I THANKED HIM AND APOLOGISED AND AGAIN HE
SAID IN THE CHEERFULLEST MANNER NOT AT ALL I AM SURE AND RESUMED

THERE APPEARED UPON THE SCENESAY AT THE RACES OR THE PUBLIC BALLS
OR ANYWHERE ELSE YOU LIKEA CERTAIN MAN WHO MADE LOVE TO MISS
HAVISHAM I NEVER SAW HIM FOR THIS HAPPENED FIVEANDTWENTY YEARS AGO
BEFORE YOU AND I WERE HANDEL BUT I HAVE HEARD MY FATHER MENTION THAT
HE WAS A SHOWY MAN AND THE KIND OF MAN FOR THE PURPOSE BUT THAT HE
WAS NOT TO BE WITHOUT IGNORANCE OR PREJUDICE MISTAKEN FOR A
GENTLEMAN MY FATHER MOST STRONGLY ASSEVERATES BECAUSE IT IS A
PRINCIPLE OF HIS THAT NO MAN WHO WAS NOT A TRUE GENTLEMAN AT HEART EVER
WAS SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN A TRUE GENTLEMAN IN MANNER HE SAYS NO
VARNISH CAN HIDE THE GRAIN OF THE WOOD AND THAT THE MORE VARNISH YOU
PUT ON THE MORE THE GRAIN WILL EXPRESS ITSELF WELL THIS MAN PURSUED
MISS HAVISHAM CLOSELY AND PROFESSED TO BE DEVOTED TO HER I BELIEVE
SHE HAD NOT SHOWN MUCH SUSCEPTIBILITY UP TO THAT TIME BUT ALL THE
SUSCEPTIBILITY SHE POSSESSED CERTAINLY CAME OUT THEN AND SHE
PASSIONATELY LOVED HIM THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SHE PERFECTLY IDOLIZED
HIM HE PRACTISED ON HER AFFECTION IN THAT SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT HE GOT
GREAT SUMS OF MONEY FROM HER AND HE INDUCED HER TO BUY HER BROTHER OUT
OF A SHARE IN THE BREWERY WHICH HAD BEEN WEAKLY LEFT HIM BY HIS
FATHER AT AN IMMENSE PRICE ON THE PLEA THAT WHEN HE WAS HER HUSBAND
HE MUST HOLD AND MANAGE IT ALL YOUR GUARDIAN WAS NOT AT THAT TIME IN
MISS HAVISHAMS COUNSELS AND SHE WAS TOO HAUGHTY AND TOO MUCH IN LOVE
TO BE ADVISED BY ANY ONE HER RELATIONS WERE POOR AND SCHEMING WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF MY FATHER HE WAS POOR ENOUGH BUT NOT TIMESERVING OR
JEALOUS THE ONLY INDEPENDENT ONE AMONG THEM HE WARNED HER THAT SHE
WAS DOING TOO MUCH FOR THIS MAN AND WAS PLACING HERSELF TOO
UNRESERVEDLY IN HIS POWER SHE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF ANGRILY
ORDERING MY FATHER OUT OF THE HOUSE IN HIS PRESENCE AND MY FATHER HAS
NEVER SEEN HER SINCE

I THOUGHT OF HER HAVING SAID MATTHEW WILL COME AND SEE ME AT LAST
WHEN I AM LAID DEAD UPON THAT TABLE AND I ASKED HERBERT WHETHER HIS
FATHER WAS SO INVETERATE AGAINST HER

ITS NOT THAT SAID HE BUT SHE CHARGED HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HER
INTENDED HUSBAND WITH BEING DISAPPOINTED IN THE HOPE OF FAWNING UPON
HER FOR HIS OWN ADVANCEMENT AND IF HE WERE TO GO TO HER NOW IT WOULD
LOOK TRUEEVEN TO HIMAND EVEN TO HER TO RETURN TO THE MAN AND MAKE AN
END OF HIM THE MARRIAGE DAY WAS FIXED THE WEDDING DRESSES WERE
BOUGHT THE WEDDING TOUR WAS PLANNED OUT THE WEDDING GUESTS WERE
INVITED THE DAY CAME BUT NOT THE BRIDEGROOM HE WROTE HER A LETTER

WHICH SHE RECEIVED I STRUCK IN WHEN SHE WAS DRESSING FOR HER
MARRIAGE AT TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE

AT THE HOUR AND MINUTE SAID HERBERT NODDING AT WHICH SHE
AFTERWARDS STOPPED ALL THE CLOCKS WHAT WAS IN IT FURTHER THAN THAT IT
MOST HEARTLESSLY BROKE THE MARRIAGE OFF I CANT TELL YOU BECAUSE I
DONT KNOW WHEN SHE RECOVERED FROM A BAD ILLNESS THAT SHE HAD SHE
LAID THE WHOLE PLACE WASTE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IT AND SHE HAS NEVER
SINCE LOOKED UPON THE LIGHT OF DAY

IS THAT ALL THE STORY I ASKED AFTER CONSIDERING IT

ALL I KNOW OF IT AND INDEED I ONLY KNOW SO MUCH THROUGH PIECING IT
OUT FOR MYSELF FOR MY FATHER ALWAYS AVOIDS IT AND EVEN WHEN MISS
HAVISHAM INVITED ME TO GO THERE TOLD ME NO MORE OF IT THAN IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY REQUISITE I SHOULD UNDERSTAND BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE
THING IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT THE MAN TO WHOM SHE GAVE HER MISPLACED
CONFIDENCE ACTED THROUGHOUT IN CONCERT WITH HER HALFBROTHER THAT IT
WAS A CONSPIRACY BETWEEN THEM AND THAT THEY SHARED THE PROFITS

I WONDER HE DIDNT MARRY HER AND GET ALL THE PROPERTY SAID I

HE MAY HAVE BEEN MARRIED ALREADY AND HER CRUEL MORTIFICATION MAY HAVE
BEEN A PART OF HER HALFBROTHERS SCHEME SAID HERBERT MIND I DONT
KNOW THAT

WHAT BECAME OF THE TWO MEN I ASKED AFTER AGAIN CONSIDERING THE
SUBJECT

THEY FELL INTO DEEPER SHAME AND DEGRADATIONIF THERE CAN BE DEEPERAND
RUIN

ARE THEY ALIVE NOW

I DONT KNOW

YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT ESTELLA WAS NOT RELATED TO MISS HAVISHAM BUT
ADOPTED WHEN ADOPTED

HERBERT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ESTELLA
SINCE I HAVE HEARD OF A MISS HAVISHAM I KNOW NO MORE AND NOW
HANDEL SAID HE FINALLY THROWING OFF THE STORY AS IT WERE THERE IS
A PERFECTLY OPEN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US ALL THAT I KNOW ABOUT MISS
HAVISHAM YOU KNOW

AND ALL THAT I KNOW I RETORTED YOU KNOW

I FULLY BELIEVE IT SO THERE CAN BE NO COMPETITION OR PERPLEXITY
BETWEEN YOU AND ME AND AS TO THE CONDITION ON WHICH YOU HOLD YOUR
ADVANCEMENT IN LIFENAMELY THAT YOU ARE NOT TO INQUIRE OR DISCUSS TO
WHOM YOU OWE ITYOU MAY BE VERY SURE THAT IT WILL NEVER BE ENCROACHED
UPON OR EVEN APPROACHED BY ME OR BY ANY ONE BELONGING TO ME

IN TRUTH HE SAID THIS WITH SO MUCH DELICACY THAT I FELT THE SUBJECT
DONE WITH EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD BE UNDER HIS FATHERS ROOF FOR YEARS
AND YEARS TO COME YET HE SAID IT WITH SO MUCH MEANING TOO THAT I
FELT HE AS PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD MISS HAVISHAM TO BE MY BENEFACTRESS AS
I UNDERSTOOD THE FACT MYSELF

IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE THAT HE HAD LED UP TO THE THEME FOR
THE PURPOSE OF CLEARING IT OUT OF OUR WAY BUT WE WERE SO MUCH THE
LIGHTER AND EASIER FOR HAVING BROACHED IT THAT I NOW PERCEIVED THIS TO
BE THE CASE WE WERE VERY GAY AND SOCIABLE AND I ASKED HIM IN THE
COURSE OF CONVERSATION WHAT HE WAS HE REPLIED A CAPITALISTAN
INSURER OF SHIPS I SUPPOSE HE SAW ME GLANCING ABOUT THE ROOM IN
SEARCH OF SOME TOKENS OF SHIPPING OR CAPITAL FOR HE ADDED IN THE
CITY

I HAD GRAND IDEAS OF THE WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE OF INSURERS OF SHIPS IN
THE CITY AND I BEGAN TO THINK WITH AWE OF HAVING LAID A YOUNG INSURER
ON HIS BACK BLACKENED HIS ENTERPRISING EYE AND CUT HIS RESPONSIBLE
HEAD OPEN BUT AGAIN THERE CAME UPON ME FOR MY RELIEF THAT ODD
IMPRESSION THAT HERBERT POCKET WOULD NEVER BE VERY SUCCESSFUL OR RICH

I SHALL NOT REST SATISFIED WITH MERELY EMPLOYING MY CAPITAL IN
INSURING SHIPS I SHALL BUY UP SOME GOOD LIFE ASSURANCE SHARES AND CUT
INTO THE DIRECTION I SHALL ALSO DO A LITTLE IN THE MINING WAY NONE OF
THESE THINGS WILL INTERFERE WITH MY CHARTERING A FEW THOUSAND TONS ON
MY OWN ACCOUNT I THINK I SHALL TRADE SAID HE LEANING BACK IN HIS
CHAIR TO THE EAST INDIES FOR SILKS SHAWLS SPICES DYES DRUGS AND
PRECIOUS WOODS ITS AN INTERESTING TRADE

AND THE PROFITS ARE LARGE SAID I

TREMENDOUS SAID HE

I WAVERED AGAIN AND BEGAN TO THINK HERE WERE GREATER EXPECTATIONS THAN
MY OWN

ILLUSTRATION

I THINK I SHALL TRADE ALSO SAID HE PUTTING HIS THUMBS IN HIS
WAISTCOAT POCKETS TO THE WEST INDIES FOR SUGAR TOBACCO AND RUM
ALSO TO CEYLON ESPECIALLY FOR ELEPHANTS TUSKS

YOU WILL WANT A GOOD MANY SHIPS SAID I

A PERFECT FLEET SAID HE

QUITE OVERPOWERED BY THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THESE TRANSACTIONS I ASKED
HIM WHERE THE SHIPS HE INSURED MOSTLY TRADED TO AT PRESENT

I HAVENT BEGUN INSURING YET HE REPLIED I AM LOOKING ABOUT ME

SOMEHOW THAT PURSUIT SEEMED MORE IN KEEPING WITH BARNARDS INN I SAID
IN A TONE OF CONVICTION AHH

YES I AM IN A COUNTINGHOUSE AND LOOKING ABOUT ME

IS A COUNTINGHOUSE PROFITABLE I ASKED

TODO YOU MEAN TO THE YOUNG FELLOW WHOS IN IT HE ASKED IN REPLY

YES TO YOU

WHY NNO NOT TO ME HE SAID THIS WITH THE AIR OF ONE CAREFULLY
RECKONING UP AND STRIKING A BALANCE NOT DIRECTLY PROFITABLE THAT IS
IT DOESNT PAY ME ANYTHING AND I HAVE TOKEEP MYSELF

THIS CERTAINLY HAD NOT A PROFITABLE APPEARANCE AND I SHOOK MY HEAD AS
IF I WOULD IMPLY THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO LAY BY MUCH ACCUMULATIVE
CAPITAL FROM SUCH A SOURCE OF INCOME

BUT THE THING IS SAID HERBERT POCKET THAT YOU LOOK ABOUT YOU
THATS THE GRAND THING YOU ARE IN A COUNTINGHOUSE YOU KNOW AND
YOU LOOK ABOUT YOU

IT STRUCK ME AS A SINGULAR IMPLICATION THAT YOU COULDNT BE OUT OF A
COUNTINGHOUSE YOU KNOW AND LOOK ABOUT YOU BUT I SILENTLY DEFERRED
TO HIS EXPERIENCE

THEN THE TIME COMES SAID HERBERT WHEN YOU SEE YOUR OPENING AND
YOU GO IN AND YOU SWOOP UPON IT AND YOU MAKE YOUR CAPITAL AND THEN
THERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU HAVE ONCE MADE YOUR CAPITAL YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO DO BUT EMPLOY IT

THIS WAS VERY LIKE HIS WAY OF CONDUCTING THAT ENCOUNTER IN THE GARDEN
VERY LIKE HIS MANNER OF BEARING HIS POVERTY TOO EXACTLY CORRESPONDED
TO HIS MANNER OF BEARING THAT DEFEAT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE TOOK ALL
BLOWS AND BUFFETS NOW WITH JUST THE SAME AIR AS HE HAD TAKEN MINE THEN
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NOTHING AROUND HIM BUT THE SIMPLEST
NECESSARIES FOR EVERYTHING THAT I REMARKED UPON TURNED OUT TO HAVE
BEEN SENT IN ON MY ACCOUNT FROM THE COFFEEHOUSE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE

YET HAVING ALREADY MADE HIS FORTUNE IN HIS OWN MIND HE WAS SO
UNASSUMING WITH IT THAT I FELT QUITE GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR NOT BEING
PUFFED UP IT WAS A PLEASANT ADDITION TO HIS NATURALLY PLEASANT WAYS
AND WE GOT ON FAMOUSLY IN THE EVENING WE WENT OUT FOR A WALK IN THE
STREETS AND WENT HALFPRICE TO THE THEATRE AND NEXT DAY WE WENT TO
CHURCH AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND IN THE AFTERNOON WE WALKED IN THE
PARKS AND I WONDERED WHO SHOD ALL THE HORSES THERE AND WISHED JOE
DID

ON A MODERATE COMPUTATION IT WAS MANY MONTHS THAT SUNDAY SINCE I HAD
LEFT JOE AND BIDDY THE SPACE INTERPOSED BETWEEN MYSELF AND THEM
PARTOOK OF THAT EXPANSION AND OUR MARSHES WERE ANY DISTANCE OFF THAT
I COULD HAVE BEEN AT OUR OLD CHURCH IN MY OLD CHURCHGOING CLOTHES ON
THE VERY LAST SUNDAY THAT EVER WAS SEEMED A COMBINATION OF
IMPOSSIBILITIES GEOGRAPHICAL AND SOCIAL SOLAR AND LUNAR YET IN THE
LONDON STREETS SO CROWDED WITH PEOPLE AND SO BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED IN THE
DUSK OF EVENING THERE WERE DEPRESSING HINTS OF REPROACHES FOR THAT I
HAD PUT THE POOR OLD KITCHEN AT HOME SO FAR AWAY AND IN THE DEAD OF
NIGHT THE FOOTSTEPS OF SOME INCAPABLE IMPOSTOR OF A PORTER MOONING
ABOUT BARNARDS INN UNDER PRETENCE OF WATCHING IT FELL HOLLOW ON MY
HEART

ON THE MONDAY MORNING AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE HERBERT WENT TO THE
COUNTINGHOUSE TO REPORT HIMSELFTO LOOK ABOUT HIM TOO I
SUPPOSEAND I BORE HIM COMPANY HE WAS TO COME AWAY IN AN HOUR OR TWO
TO ATTEND ME TO HAMMERSMITH AND I WAS TO WAIT ABOUT FOR HIM IT
APPEARED TO ME THAT THE EGGS FROM WHICH YOUNG INSURERS WERE HATCHED
WERE INCUBATED IN DUST AND HEAT LIKE THE EGGS OF OSTRICHES JUDGING
FROM THE PLACES TO WHICH THOSE INCIPIENT GIANTS REPAIRED ON A MONDAY
MORNING NOR DID THE COUNTINGHOUSE WHERE HERBERT ASSISTED SHOW IN MY
EYES AS AT ALL A GOOD OBSERVATORY BEING A BACK SECOND FLOOR UP A YARD
OF A GRIMY PRESENCE IN ALL PARTICULARS AND WITH A LOOK INTO ANOTHER
BACK SECOND FLOOR RATHER THAN A LOOK OUT

I WAITED ABOUT UNTIL IT WAS NOON AND I WENT UPON CHANGE AND I SAW
FLUEY MEN SITTING THERE UNDER THE BILLS ABOUT SHIPPING WHOM I TOOK TO
BE GREAT MERCHANTS THOUGH I COULDNT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SHOULD ALL BE
OUT OF SPIRITS WHEN HERBERT CAME WE WENT AND HAD LUNCH AT A
CELEBRATED HOUSE WHICH I THEN QUITE VENERATED BUT NOW BELIEVE TO HAVE
BEEN THE MOST ABJECT SUPERSTITION IN EUROPE AND WHERE I COULD NOT HELP
NOTICING EVEN THEN THAT THERE WAS MUCH MORE GRAVY ON THE TABLECLOTHS
AND KNIVES AND WAITERS CLOTHES THAN IN THE STEAKS THIS COLLATION
DISPOSED OF AT A MODERATE PRICE CONSIDERING THE GREASE WHICH WAS NOT
CHARGED FOR WE WENT BACK TO BARNARDS INN AND GOT MY LITTLE
PORTMANTEAU AND THEN TOOK COACH FOR HAMMERSMITH WE ARRIVED THERE AT
TWO OR THREE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND HAD VERY LITTLE WAY TO WALK
TO MR POCKETS HOUSE LIFTING THE LATCH OF A GATE WE PASSED DIRECT
INTO A LITTLE GARDEN OVERLOOKING THE RIVER WHERE MR POCKETS CHILDREN
WERE PLAYING ABOUT AND UNLESS I DECEIVE MYSELF ON A POINT WHERE MY
INTERESTS OR PREPOSSESSIONS ARE CERTAINLY NOT CONCERNED I SAW THAT MR
AND MRS POCKETS CHILDREN WERE NOT GROWING UP OR BEING BROUGHT UP BUT
WERE TUMBLING UP

MRS POCKET WAS SITTING ON A GARDEN CHAIR UNDER A TREE READING WITH
HER LEGS UPON ANOTHER GARDEN CHAIR AND MRS POCKETS TWO NURSEMAIDS
WERE LOOKING ABOUT THEM WHILE THE CHILDREN PLAYED MAMMA SAID
HERBERT THIS IS YOUNG MR PIP UPON WHICH MRS POCKET RECEIVED ME
WITH AN APPEARANCE OF AMIABLE DIGNITY

MASTER ALICK AND MISS JANE CRIED ONE OF THE NURSES TO TWO OF THE
CHILDREN IF YOU GO A BOUNCING UP AGAINST THEM BUSHES YOULL FALL OVER
INTO THE RIVER AND BE DROWNDED AND WHATLL YOUR PA SAY THEN

AT THE SAME TIME THIS NURSE PICKED UP MRS POCKETS HANDKERCHIEF AND
SAID IF THAT DONT MAKE SIX TIMES YOUVE DROPPED IT MUM UPON WHICH
MRS POCKET LAUGHED AND SAID THANK YOU FLOPSON AND SETTLING
HERSELF IN ONE CHAIR ONLY RESUMED HER BOOK HER COUNTENANCE
IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED A KNITTED AND INTENT EXPRESSION AS IF SHE HAD BEEN
READING FOR A WEEK BUT BEFORE SHE COULD HAVE READ HALF A DOZEN LINES
SHE FIXED HER EYES UPON ME AND SAID I HOPE YOUR MAMMA IS QUITE
WELL THIS UNEXPECTED INQUIRY PUT ME INTO SUCH A DIFFICULTY THAT I
BEGAN SAYING IN THE ABSURDEST WAY THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SUCH
PERSON I HAD NO DOUBT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE WELL AND WOULD HAVE
BEEN VERY MUCH OBLIGED AND WOULD HAVE SENT HER COMPLIMENTS WHEN THE
NURSE CAME TO MY RESCUE

WELL SHE CRIED PICKING UP THE POCKETHANDKERCHIEF IF THAT DONT
MAKE SEVEN TIMES WHAT ARE YOU ADOING OF THIS AFTERNOON MUM MRS
POCKET RECEIVED HER PROPERTY AT FIRST WITH A LOOK OF UNUTTERABLE
SURPRISE AS IF SHE HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND THEN WITH A LAUGH OF
RECOGNITION AND SAID THANK YOU FLOPSON AND FORGOT ME AND WENT ON
READING

I FOUND NOW I HAD LEISURE TO COUNT THEM THAT THERE WERE NO FEWER THAN
SIX LITTLE POCKETS PRESENT IN VARIOUS STAGES OF TUMBLING UP I HAD
SCARCELY ARRIVED AT THE TOTAL WHEN A SEVENTH WAS HEARD AS IN THE
REGION OF AIR WAILING DOLEFULLY

IF THERE AINT BABY SAID FLOPSON APPEARING TO THINK IT MOST
SURPRISING MAKE HASTE UP MILLERS

MILLERS WHO WAS THE OTHER NURSE RETIRED INTO THE HOUSE AND BY
DEGREES THE CHILDS WAILING WAS HUSHED AND STOPPED AS IF IT WERE A
YOUNG VENTRILOQUIST WITH SOMETHING IN ITS MOUTH MRS POCKET READ ALL
THE TIME AND I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE BOOK COULD BE

WE WERE WAITING I SUPPOSED FOR MR POCKET TO COME OUT TO US AT ANY
RATE WE WAITED THERE AND SO I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING THE
REMARKABLE FAMILY PHENOMENON THAT WHENEVER ANY OF THE CHILDREN STRAYED
NEAR MRS POCKET IN THEIR PLAY THEY ALWAYS TRIPPED THEMSELVES UP AND
TUMBLED OVER HERALWAYS VERY MUCH TO HER MOMENTARY ASTONISHMENT AND
THEIR OWN MORE ENDURING LAMENTATION I WAS AT A LOSS TO ACCOUNT FOR
THIS SURPRISING CIRCUMSTANCE AND COULD NOT HELP GIVING MY MIND TO
SPECULATIONS ABOUT IT UNTIL BY AND BY MILLERS CAME DOWN WITH THE BABY
WHICH BABY WAS HANDED TO FLOPSON WHICH FLOPSON WAS HANDING IT TO MRS
POCKET WHEN SHE TOO WENT FAIRLY HEAD FOREMOST OVER MRS POCKET BABY
AND ALL AND WAS CAUGHT BY HERBERT AND MYSELF

GRACIOUS ME FLOPSON SAID MRS POCKET LOOKING OFF HER BOOK FOR A
MOMENT EVERYBODYS TUMBLING

GRACIOUS YOU INDEED MUM RETURNED FLOPSON VERY RED IN THE FACE
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE

I GOT HERE FLOPSON ASKED MRS POCKET

WHY IF IT AINT YOUR FOOTSTOOL CRIED FLOPSON AND IF YOU KEEP IT
UNDER YOUR SKIRTS LIKE THAT WHOS TO HELP TUMBLING HERE TAKE THE
BABY MUM AND GIVE ME YOUR BOOK

MRS POCKET ACTED ON THE ADVICE AND INEXPERTLY DANCED THE INFANT A
LITTLE IN HER LAP WHILE THE OTHER CHILDREN PLAYED ABOUT IT THIS HAD
LASTED BUT A VERY SHORT TIME WHEN MRS POCKET ISSUED SUMMARY ORDERS
THAT THEY WERE ALL TO BE TAKEN INTO THE HOUSE FOR A NAP THUS I MADE
THE SECOND DISCOVERY ON THAT FIRST OCCASION THAT THE NURTURE OF THE
LITTLE POCKETS CONSISTED OF ALTERNATELY TUMBLING UP AND LYING DOWN

UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN FLOPSON AND MILLERS HAD GOT THE
CHILDREN INTO THE HOUSE LIKE A LITTLE FLOCK OF SHEEP AND MR POCKET
CAME OUT OF IT TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE I WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISED TO
FIND THAT MR POCKET WAS A GENTLEMAN WITH A RATHER PERPLEXED EXPRESSION
OF FACE AND WITH HIS VERY GREY HAIR DISORDERED ON HIS HEAD AS IF HE
DIDNT QUITE SEE HIS WAY TO PUTTING ANYTHING STRAIGHT




CHAPTER XXIII


MR POCKET SAID HE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME AND HE HOPED I WAS NOT SORRY TO
SEE HIM FOR I REALLY AM NOT HE ADDED WITH HIS SONS SMILE AN
ALARMING PERSONAGE HE WAS A YOUNGLOOKING MAN IN SPITE OF HIS
PERPLEXITIES AND HIS VERY GREY HAIR AND HIS MANNER SEEMED QUITE
NATURAL I USE THE WORD NATURAL IN THE SENSE OF ITS BEING UNAFFECTED
THERE WAS SOMETHING COMIC IN HIS DISTRAUGHT WAY AS THOUGH IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN DOWNRIGHT LUDICROUS BUT FOR HIS OWN PERCEPTION THAT IT WAS
VERY NEAR BEING SO WHEN HE HAD TALKED WITH ME A LITTLE HE SAID TO
MRS POCKET WITH A RATHER ANXIOUS CONTRACTION OF HIS EYEBROWS WHICH
WERE BLACK AND HANDSOME BELINDA I HOPE YOU HAVE WELCOMED MR PIP
AND SHE LOOKED UP FROM HER BOOK AND SAID YES SHE THEN SMILED UPON
ME IN AN ABSENT STATE OF MIND AND ASKED ME IF I LIKED THE TASTE OF
ORANGEFLOWER WATER AS THE QUESTION HAD NO BEARING NEAR OR REMOTE ON
ANY FOREGONE OR SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTION I CONSIDER IT TO HAVE BEEN
THROWN OUT LIKE HER PREVIOUS APPROACHES IN GENERAL CONVERSATIONAL
CONDESCENSION

I FOUND OUT WITHIN A FEW HOURS AND MAY MENTION AT ONCE THAT MRS
POCKET WAS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF A CERTAIN QUITE ACCIDENTAL DECEASED
KNIGHT WHO HAD INVENTED FOR HIMSELF A CONVICTION THAT HIS DECEASED
FATHER WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE A BARONET BUT FOR SOMEBODYS DETERMINED
OPPOSITION ARISING OUT OF ENTIRELY PERSONAL MOTIVESI FORGET WHOSE IF
I EVER KNEWTHE SOVEREIGNS THE PRIME MINISTERS THE LORD
CHANCELLORS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURYS ANYBODYSAND HAD TACKED
HIMSELF ON TO THE NOBLES OF THE EARTH IN RIGHT OF THIS QUITE
SUPPOSITITIOUS FACT I BELIEVE HE HAD BEEN KNIGHTED HIMSELF FOR
STORMING THE ENGLISH GRAMMAR AT THE POINT OF THE PEN IN A DESPERATE
ADDRESS ENGROSSED ON VELLUM ON THE OCCASION OF THE LAYING OF THE FIRST
STONE OF SOME BUILDING OR OTHER AND FOR HANDING SOME ROYAL PERSONAGE
EITHER THE TROWEL OR THE MORTAR BE THAT AS IT MAY HE HAD DIRECTED
MRS POCKET TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM HER CRADLE AS ONE WHO IN THE NATURE
OF THINGS MUST MARRY A TITLE AND WHO WAS TO BE GUARDED FROM THE
ACQUISITION OF PLEBEIAN DOMESTIC KNOWLEDGE

SO SUCCESSFUL A WATCH AND WARD HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED OVER THE YOUNG LADY
BY THIS JUDICIOUS PARENT THAT SHE HAD GROWN UP HIGHLY ORNAMENTAL BUT
PERFECTLY HELPLESS AND USELESS WITH HER CHARACTER THUS HAPPILY FORMED
IN THE FIRST BLOOM OF HER YOUTH SHE HAD ENCOUNTERED MR POCKET WHO WAS
ALSO IN THE FIRST BLOOM OF YOUTH AND NOT QUITE DECIDED WHETHER TO
MOUNT TO THE WOOLSACK OR TO ROOF HIMSELF IN WITH A MITRE AS HIS DOING
THE ONE OR THE OTHER WAS A MERE QUESTION OF TIME HE AND MRS POCKET
HAD TAKEN TIME BY THE FORELOCK WHEN TO JUDGE FROM ITS LENGTH IT
WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WANTED CUTTING AND HAD MARRIED WITHOUT THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE JUDICIOUS PARENT THE JUDICIOUS PARENT HAVING NOTHING
TO BESTOW OR WITHHOLD BUT HIS BLESSING HAD HANDSOMELY SETTLED THAT
DOWER UPON THEM AFTER A SHORT STRUGGLE AND HAD INFORMED MR POCKET
THAT HIS WIFE WAS A TREASURE FOR A PRINCE MR POCKET HAD INVESTED
THE PRINCES TREASURE IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD EVER SINCE AND IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN BUT INDIFFERENT INTEREST STILL MRS
POCKET WAS IN GENERAL THE OBJECT OF A QUEER SORT OF RESPECTFUL PITY
BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT MARRIED A TITLE WHILE MR POCKET WAS THE OBJECT OF
A QUEER SORT OF FORGIVING REPROACH BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER GOT ONE

MR POCKET TOOK ME INTO THE HOUSE AND SHOWED ME MY ROOM WHICH WAS A
PLEASANT ONE AND SO FURNISHED AS THAT I COULD USE IT WITH COMFORT FOR
MY OWN PRIVATE SITTINGROOM HE THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOORS OF TWO OTHER
SIMILAR ROOMS AND INTRODUCED ME TO THEIR OCCUPANTS BY NAME DRUMMLE
AND STARTOP DRUMMLE AN OLDLOOKING YOUNG MAN OF A HEAVY ORDER OF
ARCHITECTURE WAS WHISTLING STARTOP YOUNGER IN YEARS AND APPEARANCE
WAS READING AND HOLDING HIS HEAD AS IF HE THOUGHT HIMSELF IN DANGER OF
EXPLODING IT WITH TOO STRONG A CHARGE OF KNOWLEDGE

BOTH MR AND MRS POCKET HAD SUCH A NOTICEABLE AIR OF BEING IN SOMEBODY
ELSES HANDS THAT I WONDERED WHO REALLY WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE
AND LET THEM LIVE THERE UNTIL I FOUND THIS UNKNOWN POWER TO BE THE
SERVANTS IT WAS A SMOOTH WAY OF GOING ON PERHAPS IN RESPECT OF
SAVING TROUBLE BUT IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING EXPENSIVE FOR THE
SERVANTS FELT IT A DUTY THEY OWED TO THEMSELVES TO BE NICE IN THEIR
EATING AND DRINKING AND TO KEEP A DEAL OF COMPANY DOWNSTAIRS THEY
ALLOWED A VERY LIBERAL TABLE TO MR AND MRS POCKET YET IT ALWAYS
APPEARED TO ME THAT BY FAR THE BEST PART OF THE HOUSE TO HAVE BOARDED
IN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE KITCHENALWAYS SUPPOSING THE BOARDER CAPABLE OF
SELFDEFENCE FOR BEFORE I HAD BEEN THERE A WEEK A NEIGHBOURING LADY
WITH WHOM THE FAMILY WERE PERSONALLY UNACQUAINTED WROTE IN TO SAY THAT
SHE HAD SEEN MILLERS SLAPPING THE BABY THIS GREATLY DISTRESSED MRS
POCKET WHO BURST INTO TEARS ON RECEIVING THE NOTE AND SAID THAT IT
WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT THE NEIGHBOURS COULDNT MIND THEIR OWN
BUSINESS

BY DEGREES I LEARNT AND CHIEFLY FROM HERBERT THAT MR POCKET HAD BEEN
EDUCATED AT HARROW AND AT CAMBRIDGE WHERE HE HAD DISTINGUISHED
HIMSELF BUT THAT WHEN HE HAD HAD THE HAPPINESS OF MARRYING MRS POCKET
VERY EARLY IN LIFE HE HAD IMPAIRED HIS PROSPECTS AND TAKEN UP THE
CALLING OF A GRINDER AFTER GRINDING A NUMBER OF DULL BLADESOF WHOM
IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THEIR FATHERS WHEN INFLUENTIAL WERE ALWAYS
GOING TO HELP HIM TO PREFERMENT BUT ALWAYS FORGOT TO DO IT WHEN THE
BLADES HAD LEFT THE GRINDSTONEHE HAD WEARIED OF THAT POOR WORK AND
HAD COME TO LONDON HERE AFTER GRADUALLY FAILING IN LOFTIER HOPES HE
HAD READ WITH DIVERS WHO HAD LACKED OPPORTUNITIES OR NEGLECTED THEM
AND HAD REFURBISHED DIVERS OTHERS FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS AND HAD TURNED
HIS ACQUIREMENTS TO THE ACCOUNT OF LITERARY COMPILATION AND CORRECTION
AND ON SUCH MEANS ADDED TO SOME VERY MODERATE PRIVATE RESOURCES STILL
MAINTAINED THE HOUSE I SAW

MR AND MRS POCKET HAD A TOADY NEIGHBOUR A WIDOW LADY OF THAT HIGHLY
SYMPATHETIC NATURE THAT SHE AGREED WITH EVERYBODY BLESSED EVERYBODY
AND SHED SMILES AND TEARS ON EVERYBODY ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS LADYS NAME WAS MRS COILER AND I HAD THE HONOUR OF TAKING HER
DOWN TO DINNER ON THE DAY OF MY INSTALLATION SHE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND
ON THE STAIRS THAT IT WAS A BLOW TO DEAR MRS POCKET THAT DEAR MR
POCKET SHOULD BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF RECEIVING GENTLEMEN TO READ
WITH HIM THAT DID NOT EXTEND TO ME SHE TOLD ME IN A GUSH OF LOVE AND
CONFIDENCE AT THAT TIME I HAD KNOWN HER SOMETHING LESS THAN FIVE
MINUTES IF THEY WERE ALL LIKE ME IT WOULD BE QUITE ANOTHER THING

BUT DEAR MRS POCKET SAID MRS COILER AFTER HER EARLY
DISAPPOINTMENT NOT THAT DEAR MR POCKET WAS TO BLAME IN THAT
REQUIRES SO MUCH LUXURY AND ELEGANCE

YES MAAM I SAID TO STOP HER FOR I WAS AFRAID SHE WAS GOING TO
CRY

AND SHE IS OF SO ARISTOCRATIC A DISPOSITION

YES MAAM I SAID AGAIN WITH THE SAME OBJECT AS BEFORE

THAT IT IS HARD SAID MRS COILER TO HAVE DEAR MR POCKETS TIME
AND ATTENTION DIVERTED FROM DEAR MRS POCKET

I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE HARDER IF THE BUTCHERS TIME
AND ATTENTION WERE DIVERTED FROM DEAR MRS POCKET BUT I SAID NOTHING
AND INDEED HAD ENOUGH TO DO IN KEEPING A BASHFUL WATCH UPON MY COMPANY
MANNERS

IT CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE THROUGH WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MRS POCKET AND
DRUMMLE WHILE I WAS ATTENTIVE TO MY KNIFE AND FORK SPOON GLASSES AND
OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF SELFDESTRUCTION THAT DRUMMLE WHOSE CHRISTIAN
NAME WAS BENTLEY WAS ACTUALLY THE NEXT HEIR BUT ONE TO A BARONETCY IT
FURTHER APPEARED THAT THE BOOK I HAD SEEN MRS POCKET READING IN THE
GARDEN WAS ALL ABOUT TITLES AND THAT SHE KNEW THE EXACT DATE AT WHICH
HER GRANDPAPA WOULD HAVE COME INTO THE BOOK IF HE EVER HAD COME AT
ALL DRUMMLE DIDNT SAY MUCH BUT IN HIS LIMITED WAY HE STRUCK ME AS A
SULKY KIND OF FELLOW HE SPOKE AS ONE OF THE ELECT AND RECOGNISED MRS
POCKET AS A WOMAN AND A SISTER NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES AND MRS COILER
THE TOADY NEIGHBOUR SHOWED ANY INTEREST IN THIS PART OF THE
CONVERSATION AND IT APPEARED TO ME THAT IT WAS PAINFUL TO HERBERT BUT
IT PROMISED TO LAST A LONG TIME WHEN THE PAGE CAME IN WITH THE
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DOMESTIC AFFLICTION IT WAS IN EFFECT THAT THE COOK
HAD MISLAID THE BEEF TO MY UNUTTERABLE AMAZEMENT I NOW FOR THE FIRST
TIME SAW MR POCKET RELIEVE HIS MIND BY GOING THROUGH A PERFORMANCE
THAT STRUCK ME AS VERY EXTRAORDINARY BUT WHICH MADE NO IMPRESSION ON
ANYBODY ELSE AND WITH WHICH I SOON BECAME AS FAMILIAR AS THE REST HE
LAID DOWN THE CARVINGKNIFE AND FORKBEING ENGAGED IN CARVING AT THE
MOMENTPUT HIS TWO HANDS INTO HIS DISTURBED HAIR AND APPEARED TO MAKE
AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT TO LIFT HIMSELF UP BY IT WHEN HE HAD DONE
THIS AND HAD NOT LIFTED HIMSELF UP AT ALL HE QUIETLY WENT ON WITH
WHAT HE WAS ABOUT

MRS COILER THEN CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND BEGAN TO FLATTER ME I LIKED
IT FOR A FEW MOMENTS BUT SHE FLATTERED ME SO VERY GROSSLY THAT THE
PLEASURE WAS SOON OVER SHE HAD A SERPENTINE WAY OF COMING CLOSE AT ME
WHEN SHE PRETENDED TO BE VITALLY INTERESTED IN THE FRIENDS AND
LOCALITIES I HAD LEFT WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER SNAKY AND FORKTONGUED AND
WHEN SHE MADE AN OCCASIONAL BOUNCE UPON STARTOP WHO SAID VERY LITTLE
TO HER OR UPON DRUMMLE WHO SAID LESS I RATHER ENVIED THEM FOR
BEING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE

AFTER DINNER THE CHILDREN WERE INTRODUCED AND MRS COILER MADE
ADMIRING COMMENTS ON THEIR EYES NOSES AND LEGSA SAGACIOUS WAY OF
IMPROVING THEIR MINDS THERE WERE FOUR LITTLE GIRLS AND TWO LITTLE
BOYS BESIDES THE BABY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER AND THE BABYS NEXT
SUCCESSOR WHO WAS AS YET NEITHER THEY WERE BROUGHT IN BY FLOPSON AND
MILLERS MUCH AS THOUGH THOSE TWO NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAD BEEN
RECRUITING SOMEWHERE FOR CHILDREN AND HAD ENLISTED THESE WHILE MRS
POCKET LOOKED AT THE YOUNG NOBLES THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AS IF SHE
RATHER THOUGHT SHE HAD HAD THE PLEASURE OF INSPECTING THEM BEFORE BUT
DIDNT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM

HERE GIVE ME YOUR FORK MUM AND TAKE THE BABY SAID FLOPSON DONT
TAKE IT THAT WAY OR YOULL GET ITS HEAD UNDER THE TABLE

THUS ADVISED MRS POCKET TOOK IT THE OTHER WAY AND GOT ITS HEAD UPON
THE TABLE WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED TO ALL PRESENT BY A PRODIGIOUS
CONCUSSION

DEAR DEAR GIVE IT ME BACK MUM SAID FLOPSON AND MISS JANE COME
AND DANCE TO BABY DO

ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS A MERE MITE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE PREMATURELY
TAKEN UPON HERSELF SOME CHARGE OF THE OTHERS STEPPED OUT OF HER PLACE
BY ME AND DANCED TO AND FROM THE BABY UNTIL IT LEFT OFF CRYING AND
LAUGHED THEN ALL THE CHILDREN LAUGHED AND MR POCKET WHO IN THE
MEANTIME HAD TWICE ENDEAVOURED TO LIFT HIMSELF UP BY THE HAIR LAUGHED
AND WE ALL LAUGHED AND WERE GLAD

FLOPSON BY DINT OF DOUBLING THE BABY AT THE JOINTS LIKE A DUTCH DOLL
THEN GOT IT SAFELY INTO MRS POCKETS LAP AND GAVE IT THE NUTCRACKERS
TO PLAY WITH AT THE SAME TIME RECOMMENDING MRS POCKET TO TAKE NOTICE
THAT THE HANDLES OF THAT INSTRUMENT WERE NOT LIKELY TO AGREE WITH ITS
EYES AND SHARPLY CHARGING MISS JANE TO LOOK AFTER THE SAME THEN THE
TWO NURSES LEFT THE ROOM AND HAD A LIVELY SCUFFLE ON THE STAIRCASE
WITH A DISSIPATED PAGE WHO HAD WAITED AT DINNER AND WHO HAD CLEARLY
LOST HALF HIS BUTTONS AT THE GAMINGTABLE

I WAS MADE VERY UNEASY IN MY MIND BY MRS POCKETS FALLING INTO A
DISCUSSION WITH DRUMMLE RESPECTING TWO BARONETCIES WHILE SHE ATE A
SLICED ORANGE STEEPED IN SUGAR AND WINE AND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE
BABY ON HER LAP WHO DID MOST APPALLING THINGS WITH THE NUTCRACKERS
AT LENGTH LITTLE JANE PERCEIVING ITS YOUNG BRAINS TO BE IMPERILLED
SOFTLY LEFT HER PLACE AND WITH MANY SMALL ARTIFICES COAXED THE
DANGEROUS WEAPON AWAY MRS POCKET FINISHING HER ORANGE AT ABOUT THE
SAME TIME AND NOT APPROVING OF THIS SAID TO JANE

YOU NAUGHTY CHILD HOW DARE YOU GO AND SIT DOWN THIS INSTANT

MAMMA DEAR LISPED THE LITTLE GIRL BABY OOD HAVE PUT HITH EYETH
OUT

HOW DARE YOU TELL ME SO RETORTED MRS POCKET GO AND SIT DOWN IN
YOUR CHAIR THIS MOMENT

MRS POCKETS DIGNITY WAS SO CRUSHING THAT I FELT QUITE ABASHED AS IF
I MYSELF HAD DONE SOMETHING TO ROUSE IT

BELINDA REMONSTRATED MR POCKET FROM THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE
HOW CAN YOU BE SO UNREASONABLE JANE ONLY INTERFERED FOR THE
PROTECTION OF BABY

I WILL NOT ALLOW ANYBODY TO INTERFERE SAID MRS POCKET I AM
SURPRISED MATTHEW THAT YOU SHOULD EXPOSE ME TO THE AFFRONT OF
INTERFERENCE

GOOD GOD CRIED MR POCKET IN AN OUTBREAK OF DESOLATE DESPERATION
ARE INFANTS TO BE NUTCRACKERED INTO THEIR TOMBS AND IS NOBODY TO
SAVE THEM

I WILL NOT BE INTERFERED WITH BY JANE SAID MRS POCKET WITH A
MAJESTIC GLANCE AT THAT INNOCENT LITTLE OFFENDER I HOPE I KNOW MY
POOR GRANDPAPAS POSITION JANE INDEED

MR POCKET GOT HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR AGAIN AND THIS TIME REALLY DID
LIFT HIMSELF SOME INCHES OUT OF HIS CHAIR HEAR THIS HE HELPLESSLY
EXCLAIMED TO THE ELEMENTS BABIES ARE TO BE NUTCRACKERED DEAD FOR
PEOPLES POOR GRANDPAPAS POSITIONS THEN HE LET HIMSELF DOWN AGAIN
AND BECAME SILENT

WE ALL LOOKED AWKWARDLY AT THE TABLECLOTH WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON A
PAUSE SUCCEEDED DURING WHICH THE HONEST AND IRREPRESSIBLE BABY MADE A
SERIES OF LEAPS AND CROWS AT LITTLE JANE WHO APPEARED TO ME TO BE THE
ONLY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IRRESPECTIVE OF SERVANTS WITH WHOM IT HAD
ANY DECIDED ACQUAINTANCE

MR DRUMMLE SAID MRS POCKET WILL YOU RING FOR FLOPSON JANE YOU
UNDUTIFUL LITTLE THING GO AND LIE DOWN NOW BABY DARLING COME WITH
MA

THE BABY WAS THE SOUL OF HONOUR AND PROTESTED WITH ALL ITS MIGHT IT
DOUBLED ITSELF UP THE WRONG WAY OVER MRS POCKETS ARM EXHIBITED A
PAIR OF KNITTED SHOES AND DIMPLED ANKLES TO THE COMPANY IN LIEU OF ITS
SOFT FACE AND WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE HIGHEST STATE OF MUTINY AND IT
GAINED ITS POINT AFTER ALL FOR I SAW IT THROUGH THE WINDOW WITHIN A
FEW MINUTES BEING NURSED BY LITTLE JANE

IT HAPPENED THAT THE OTHER FIVE CHILDREN WERE LEFT BEHIND AT THE
DINNERTABLE THROUGH FLOPSONS HAVING SOME PRIVATE ENGAGEMENT AND
THEIR NOT BEING ANYBODY ELSES BUSINESS I THUS BECAME AWARE OF THE
MUTUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM AND MR POCKET WHICH WERE EXEMPLIFIED IN
THE FOLLOWING MANNER MR POCKET WITH THE NORMAL PERPLEXITY OF HIS
FACE HEIGHTENED AND HIS HAIR RUMPLED LOOKED AT THEM FOR SOME MINUTES
AS IF HE COULDNT MAKE OUT HOW THEY CAME TO BE BOARDING AND LODGING IN
THAT ESTABLISHMENT AND WHY THEY HADNT BEEN BILLETED BY NATURE ON
SOMEBODY ELSE THEN IN A DISTANT MISSIONARY WAY HE ASKED THEM CERTAIN
QUESTIONSAS WHY LITTLE JOE HAD THAT HOLE IN HIS FRILL WHO SAID PA
FLOPSON WAS GOING TO MEND IT WHEN SHE HAD TIMEAND HOW LITTLE FANNY
CAME BY THAT WHITLOW WHO SAID PA MILLERS WAS GOING TO POULTICE IT
WHEN SHE DIDNT FORGET THEN HE MELTED INTO PARENTAL TENDERNESS AND
GAVE THEM A SHILLING APIECE AND TOLD THEM TO GO AND PLAY AND THEN AS
THEY WENT OUT WITH ONE VERY STRONG EFFORT TO LIFT HIMSELF UP BY THE
HAIR HE DISMISSED THE HOPELESS SUBJECT

IN THE EVENING THERE WAS ROWING ON THE RIVER AS DRUMMLE AND STARTOP
HAD EACH A BOAT I RESOLVED TO SET UP MINE AND TO CUT THEM BOTH OUT I
WAS PRETTY GOOD AT MOST EXERCISES IN WHICH COUNTRY BOYS ARE ADEPTS BUT
AS I WAS CONSCIOUS OF WANTING ELEGANCE OF STYLE FOR THE THAMESNOT TO
SAY FOR OTHER WATERSI AT ONCE ENGAGED TO PLACE MYSELF UNDER THE
TUITION OF THE WINNER OF A PRIZEWHERRY WHO PLIED AT OUR STAIRS AND TO
WHOM I WAS INTRODUCED BY MY NEW ALLIES THIS PRACTICAL AUTHORITY
CONFUSED ME VERY MUCH BY SAYING I HAD THE ARM OF A BLACKSMITH IF HE
COULD HAVE KNOWN HOW NEARLY THE COMPLIMENT LOST HIM HIS PUPIL I DOUBT
IF HE WOULD HAVE PAID IT

THERE WAS A SUPPERTRAY AFTER WE GOT HOME AT NIGHT AND I THINK WE
SHOULD ALL HAVE ENJOYED OURSELVES BUT FOR A RATHER DISAGREEABLE
DOMESTIC OCCURRENCE MR POCKET WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS WHEN A HOUSEMAID
CAME IN AND SAID IF YOU PLEASE SIR I SHOULD WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU

SPEAK TO YOUR MASTER SAID MRS POCKET WHOSE DIGNITY WAS ROUSED
AGAIN HOW CAN YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING GO AND SPEAK TO FLOPSON OR
SPEAK TO MEAT SOME OTHER TIME

BEGGING YOUR PARDON MAAM RETURNED THE HOUSEMAID I SHOULD WISH TO
SPEAK AT ONCE AND TO SPEAK TO MASTER

HEREUPON MR POCKET WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND WE MADE THE BEST OF
OURSELVES UNTIL HE CAME BACK

THIS IS A PRETTY THING BELINDA SAID MR POCKET RETURNING WITH A
COUNTENANCE EXPRESSIVE OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR HERES THE COOK LYING
INSENSIBLY DRUNK ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR WITH A LARGE BUNDLE OF FRESH
BUTTER MADE UP IN THE CUPBOARD READY TO SELL FOR GREASE

MRS POCKET INSTANTLY SHOWED MUCH AMIABLE EMOTION AND SAID THIS IS
THAT ODIOUS SOPHIAS DOING

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BELINDA DEMANDED MR POCKET

SOPHIA HAS TOLD YOU SAID MRS POCKET DID I NOT SEE HER WITH MY OWN
EYES AND HEAR HER WITH MY OWN EARS COME INTO THE ROOM JUST NOW AND ASK
TO SPEAK TO YOU

BUT HAS SHE NOT TAKEN ME DOWNSTAIRS BELINDA RETURNED MR POCKET
AND SHOWN ME THE WOMAN AND THE BUNDLE TOO

AND DO YOU DEFEND HER MATTHEW SAID MRS POCKET FOR MAKING
MISCHIEF

MR POCKET UTTERED A DISMAL GROAN

AM I GRANDPAPAS GRANDDAUGHTER TO BE NOTHING IN THE HOUSE SAID
MRS POCKET BESIDES THE COOK HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY NICE RESPECTFUL
WOMAN AND SAID IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER WHEN SHE CAME TO LOOK AFTER
THE SITUATION THAT SHE FELT I WAS BORN TO BE A DUCHESS

THERE WAS A SOFA WHERE MR POCKET STOOD AND HE DROPPED UPON IT IN THE
ATTITUDE OF THE DYING GLADIATOR STILL IN THAT ATTITUDE HE SAID WITH A
HOLLOW VOICE GOOD NIGHT MR PIP WHEN I DEEMED IT ADVISABLE TO GO
TO BED AND LEAVE HIM




CHAPTER XXIV


AFTER TWO OR THREE DAYS WHEN I HAD ESTABLISHED MYSELF IN MY ROOM AND
HAD GONE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO LONDON SEVERAL TIMES AND HAD
ORDERED ALL I WANTED OF MY TRADESMEN MR POCKET AND I HAD A LONG TALK
TOGETHER HE KNEW MORE OF MY INTENDED CAREER THAN I KNEW MYSELF FOR HE
REFERRED TO HIS HAVING BEEN TOLD BY MR JAGGERS THAT I WAS NOT DESIGNED
FOR ANY PROFESSION AND THAT I SHOULD BE WELL ENOUGH EDUCATED FOR MY
DESTINY IF I COULD HOLD MY OWN WITH THE AVERAGE OF YOUNG MEN IN
PROSPEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES I ACQUIESCED OF COURSE KNOWING NOTHING TO
THE CONTRARY

HE ADVISED MY ATTENDING CERTAIN PLACES IN LONDON FOR THE ACQUISITION
OF SUCH MERE RUDIMENTS AS I WANTED AND MY INVESTING HIM WITH THE
FUNCTIONS OF EXPLAINER AND DIRECTOR OF ALL MY STUDIES HE HOPED THAT
WITH INTELLIGENT ASSISTANCE I SHOULD MEET WITH LITTLE TO DISCOURAGE ME
AND SHOULD SOON BE ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH ANY AID BUT HIS THROUGH HIS
WAY OF SAYING THIS AND MUCH MORE TO SIMILAR PURPOSE HE PLACED HIMSELF
ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH ME IN AN ADMIRABLE MANNER AND I MAY STATE
AT ONCE THAT HE WAS ALWAYS SO ZEALOUS AND HONOURABLE IN FULFILLING HIS
COMPACT WITH ME THAT HE MADE ME ZEALOUS AND HONOURABLE IN FULFILLING
MINE WITH HIM IF HE HAD SHOWN INDIFFERENCE AS A MASTER I HAVE NO
DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT AS A PUPIL HE GAVE ME NO
SUCH EXCUSE AND EACH OF US DID THE OTHER JUSTICE NOR DID I EVER
REGARD HIM AS HAVING ANYTHING LUDICROUS ABOUT HIMOR ANYTHING BUT WHAT
WAS SERIOUS HONEST AND GOODIN HIS TUTOR COMMUNICATION WITH ME

WHEN THESE POINTS WERE SETTLED AND SO FAR CARRIED OUT AS THAT I HAD
BEGUN TO WORK IN EARNEST IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF I COULD RETAIN MY
BEDROOM IN BARNARDS INN MY LIFE WOULD BE AGREEABLY VARIED WHILE MY
MANNERS WOULD BE NONE THE WORSE FOR HERBERTS SOCIETY MR POCKET DID
NOT OBJECT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT URGED THAT BEFORE ANY STEP COULD
POSSIBLY BE TAKEN IN IT IT MUST BE SUBMITTED TO MY GUARDIAN I FELT
THAT THIS DELICACY AROSE OUT OF THE CONSIDERATION THAT THE PLAN WOULD
SAVE HERBERT SOME EXPENSE SO I WENT OFF TO LITTLE BRITAIN AND IMPARTED
MY WISH TO MR JAGGERS

IF I COULD BUY THE FURNITURE NOW HIRED FOR ME SAID I AND ONE OR
TWO OTHER LITTLE THINGS I SHOULD BE QUITE AT HOME THERE

GO IT SAID MR JAGGERS WITH A SHORT LAUGH I TOLD YOU YOUD GET
ON WELL HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT

I SAID I DIDNT KNOW HOW MUCH

COME RETORTED MR JAGGERS HOW MUCH FIFTY POUNDS

O NOT NEARLY SO MUCH

FIVE POUNDS SAID MR JAGGERS

THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT FALL THAT I SAID IN DISCOMFITURE O MORE THAN
THAT

MORE THAN THAT EH RETORTED MR JAGGERS LYING IN WAIT FOR ME WITH
HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS EYES ON THE
WALL BEHIND ME HOW MUCH MORE

IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIX A SUM SAID I HESITATING

COME SAID MR JAGGERS LETS GET AT IT TWICE FIVE WILL THAT DO
THREE TIMES FIVE WILL THAT DO FOUR TIMES FIVE WILL THAT DO

I SAID I THOUGHT THAT WOULD DO HANDSOMELY

FOUR TIMES FIVE WILL DO HANDSOMELY WILL IT SAID MR JAGGERS
KNITTING HIS BROWS NOW WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF FOUR TIMES FIVE

WHAT DO I MAKE OF IT

AH SAID MR JAGGERS HOW MUCH

I SUPPOSE YOU MAKE IT TWENTY POUNDS SAID I SMILING

NEVER MIND WHAT I MAKE IT MY FRIEND OBSERVED MR JAGGERS WITH A
KNOWING AND CONTRADICTORY TOSS OF HIS HEAD I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU
MAKE IT

TWENTY POUNDS OF COURSE

WEMMICK SAID MR JAGGERS OPENING HIS OFFICE DOOR TAKE MR PIPS
WRITTEN ORDER AND PAY HIM TWENTY POUNDS

THIS STRONGLY MARKED WAY OF DOING BUSINESS MADE A STRONGLY MARKED
IMPRESSION ON ME AND THAT NOT OF AN AGREEABLE KIND MR JAGGERS NEVER
LAUGHED BUT HE WORE GREAT BRIGHT CREAKING BOOTS AND IN POISING
HIMSELF ON THESE BOOTS WITH HIS LARGE HEAD BENT DOWN AND HIS EYEBROWS
JOINED TOGETHER AWAITING AN ANSWER HE SOMETIMES CAUSED THE BOOTS TO
CREAK AS IF THEY LAUGHED IN A DRY AND SUSPICIOUS WAY AS HE HAPPENED
TO GO OUT NOW AND AS WEMMICK WAS BRISK AND TALKATIVE I SAID TO
WEMMICK THAT I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO MAKE OF MR JAGGERSS MANNER

TELL HIM THAT AND HELL TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT ANSWERED WEMMICK
HE DONT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF ITOH FOR I
LOOKED SURPRISED ITS NOT PERSONAL ITS PROFESSIONAL ONLY
PROFESSIONAL

WEMMICK WAS AT HIS DESK LUNCHINGAND CRUNCHINGON A DRY HARD BISCUIT
PIECES OF WHICH HE THREW FROM TIME TO TIME INTO HIS SLIT OF A MOUTH AS
IF HE WERE POSTING THEM

ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME SAID WEMMICK AS IF HE HAD SET A MANTRAP AND
WAS WATCHING IT SUDDENLYCLICKYOURE CAUGHT

WITHOUT REMARKING THAT MANTRAPS WERE NOT AMONG THE AMENITIES OF LIFE
I SAID I SUPPOSED HE WAS VERY SKILFUL

DEEP SAID WEMMICK AS AUSTRALIA POINTING WITH HIS PEN AT THE
OFFICE FLOOR TO EXPRESS THAT AUSTRALIA WAS UNDERSTOOD FOR THE
PURPOSES OF THE FIGURE TO BE SYMMETRICALLY ON THE OPPOSITE SPOT OF THE
GLOBE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING DEEPER ADDED WEMMICK BRINGING HIS PEN
TO PAPER HED BE IT

THEN I SAID I SUPPOSED HE HAD A FINE BUSINESS AND WEMMICK SAID
CAPITAL THEN I ASKED IF THERE WERE MANY CLERKS TO WHICH HE
REPLIED

WE DONT RUN MUCH INTO CLERKS BECAUSE THERES ONLY ONE JAGGERS AND
PEOPLE WONT HAVE HIM AT SECOND HAND THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OF US WOULD
YOU LIKE TO SEE EM YOU ARE ONE OF US AS I MAY SAY

I ACCEPTED THE OFFER WHEN MR WEMMICK HAD PUT ALL THE BISCUIT INTO THE
POST AND HAD PAID ME MY MONEY FROM A CASHBOX IN A SAFE THE KEY OF
WHICH SAFE HE KEPT SOMEWHERE DOWN HIS BACK AND PRODUCED FROM HIS
COATCOLLAR LIKE AN IRONPIGTAIL WE WENT UPSTAIRS THE HOUSE WAS DARK
AND SHABBY AND THE GREASY SHOULDERS THAT HAD LEFT THEIR MARK IN MR
JAGGERSS ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SHUFFLING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRCASE
FOR YEARS IN THE FRONT FIRST FLOOR A CLERK WHO LOOKED SOMETHING
BETWEEN A PUBLICAN AND A RATCATCHERA LARGE PALE PUFFED SWOLLEN
MANWAS ATTENTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE OF SHABBY
APPEARANCE WHOM HE TREATED AS UNCEREMONIOUSLY AS EVERYBODY SEEMED TO
BE TREATED WHO CONTRIBUTED TO MR JAGGERSS COFFERS GETTING EVIDENCE
TOGETHER SAID MR WEMMICK AS WE CAME OUT FOR THE BAILEY IN THE
ROOM OVER THAT A LITTLE FLABBY TERRIER OF A CLERK WITH DANGLING HAIR
HIS CROPPING SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WHEN HE WAS A PUPPY WAS
SIMILARLY ENGAGED WITH A MAN WITH WEAK EYES WHOM MR WEMMICK PRESENTED
TO ME AS A SMELTER WHO KEPT HIS POT ALWAYS BOILING AND WHO WOULD MELT
ME ANYTHING I PLEASEDAND WHO WAS IN AN EXCESSIVE WHITEPERSPIRATION
AS IF HE HAD BEEN TRYING HIS ART ON HIMSELF IN A BACK ROOM A
HIGHSHOULDERED MAN WITH A FACEACHE TIED UP IN DIRTY FLANNEL WHO WAS
DRESSED IN OLD BLACK CLOTHES THAT BORE THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN
WAXED WAS STOOPING OVER HIS WORK OF MAKING FAIR COPIES OF THE NOTES OF
THE OTHER TWO GENTLEMEN FOR MR JAGGERSS OWN USE

THIS WAS ALL THE ESTABLISHMENT WHEN WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN WEMMICK
LED ME INTO MY GUARDIANS ROOM AND SAID THIS YOUVE SEEN ALREADY

PRAY SAID I AS THE TWO ODIOUS CASTS WITH THE TWITCHY LEER UPON THEM
CAUGHT MY SIGHT AGAIN WHOSE LIKENESSES ARE THOSE

THESE SAID WEMMICK GETTING UPON A CHAIR AND BLOWING THE DUST OFF
THE HORRIBLE HEADS BEFORE BRINGING THEM DOWN THESE ARE TWO CELEBRATED
ONES FAMOUS CLIENTS OF OURS THAT GOT US A WORLD OF CREDIT THIS CHAP
WHY YOU MUST HAVE COME DOWN IN THE NIGHT AND BEEN PEEPING INTO THE
INKSTAND TO GET THIS BLOT UPON YOUR EYEBROW YOU OLD RASCAL MURDERED
HIS MASTER AND CONSIDERING THAT HE WASNT BROUGHT UP TO EVIDENCE
DIDNT PLAN IT BADLY

IS IT LIKE HIM I ASKED RECOILING FROM THE BRUTE AS WEMMICK SPAT
UPON HIS EYEBROW AND GAVE IT A RUB WITH HIS SLEEVE

LIKE HIM ITS HIMSELF YOU KNOW THE CAST WAS MADE IN NEWGATE
DIRECTLY AFTER HE WAS TAKEN DOWN YOU HAD A PARTICULAR FANCY FOR ME
HADNT YOU OLD ARTFUL SAID WEMMICK HE THEN EXPLAINED THIS
AFFECTIONATE APOSTROPHE BY TOUCHING HIS BROOCH REPRESENTING THE LADY
AND THE WEEPING WILLOW AT THE TOMB WITH THE URN UPON IT AND SAYING
HAD IT MADE FOR ME EXPRESS

IS THE LADY ANYBODY SAID I

ONEAND SHE WASNT OF THIS SLENDER LADYLIKE SORT AND YOU WOULDNT
HAVE CAUGHT HER LOOKING AFTER THIS URN UNLESS THERE WAS SOMETHING TO
DRINK IN IT WEMMICKS ATTENTION BEING THUS DIRECTED TO HIS BROOCH HE
PUT DOWN THE CAST AND POLISHED THE BROOCH WITH HIS
POCKETHANDKERCHIEF

DID THAT OTHER CREATURE COME TO THE SAME END I ASKED HE HAS THE
SAME LOOK

NOSTRIL WAS CAUGHT UP WITH A HORSEHAIR AND A LITTLE FISHHOOK YES HE
CAME TO THE SAME END QUITE THE NATURAL END HERE I ASSURE YOU HE
FORGED WILLS THIS BLADE DID IF HE DIDNT ALSO PUT THE SUPPOSED
TESTATORS TO SLEEP TOO YOU WERE A GENTLEMANLY COVE THOUGH MR
WEMMICK WAS AGAIN APOSTROPHISING AND YOU SAID YOU COULD WRITE GREEK
YAH BOUNCEABLE WHAT A LIAR YOU WERE I NEVER MET SUCH A LIAR AS YOU
BEFORE PUTTING HIS LATE FRIEND ON HIS SHELF AGAIN WEMMICK TOUCHED THE
LARGEST OF HIS MOURNING RINGS AND SAID SENT OUT TO BUY IT FOR ME
ONLY THE DAY BEFORE

WHILE HE WAS PUTTING UP THE OTHER CAST AND COMING DOWN FROM THE CHAIR
THE THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND THAT ALL HIS PERSONAL JEWELRY WAS DERIVED
FROM LIKE SOURCES AS HE HAD SHOWN NO DIFFIDENCE ON THE SUBJECT I
VENTURED ON THE LIBERTY OF ASKING HIM THE QUESTION WHEN HE STOOD
BEFORE ME DUSTING HIS HANDS

O YES HE RETURNED THESE ARE ALL GIFTS OF THAT KIND ONE BRINGS
ANOTHER YOU SEE THATS THE WAY OF IT I ALWAYS TAKE EM THEYRE
CURIOSITIES AND THEYRE PROPERTY THEY MAY NOT BE WORTH MUCH BUT
AFTER ALL THEYRE PROPERTY AND PORTABLE IT DONT SIGNIFY TO YOU WITH

WHEN I HAD RENDERED HOMAGE TO THIS LIGHT HE WENT ON TO SAY IN A
FRIENDLY MANNER

MIND COMING OVER TO SEE ME AT WALWORTH I COULD OFFER YOU A BED AND I
SHOULD CONSIDER IT AN HONOUR I HAVE NOT MUCH TO SHOW YOU BUT SUCH TWO
OR THREE CURIOSITIES AS I HAVE GOT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO LOOK OVER AND I

WELL SAID WEMMICK YOULL SEE A WILD BEAST TAMED NOT SO VERY
UNCOMMON YOULL TELL ME I REPLY THAT DEPENDS ON THE ORIGINAL
WILDNESS OF THE BEAST AND THE AMOUNT OF TAMING IT WONT LOWER YOUR
OPINION OF MR JAGGERSS POWERS KEEP YOUR EYE ON IT

I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO SO WITH ALL THE INTEREST AND CURIOSITY THAT HIS
PREPARATION AWAKENED AS I WAS TAKING MY DEPARTURE HE ASKED ME IF I
WOULD LIKE TO DEVOTE FIVE MINUTES TO SEEING MR JAGGERS AT IT

FOR SEVERAL REASONS AND NOT LEAST BECAUSE I DIDNT CLEARLY KNOW WHAT
MR JAGGERS WOULD BE FOUND TO BE AT I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WE
DIVED INTO THE CITY AND CAME UP IN A CROWDED POLICECOURT WHERE A
BLOODRELATION IN THE MURDEROUS SENSE OF THE DECEASED WITH THE
FANCIFUL TASTE IN BROOCHES WAS STANDING AT THE BAR UNCOMFORTABLY
CHEWING SOMETHING WHILE MY GUARDIAN HAD A WOMAN UNDER EXAMINATION OR
CROSSEXAMINATIONI DONT KNOW WHICHAND WAS STRIKING HER AND THE
BENCH AND EVERYBODY PRESENT WITH AWE IF ANYBODY OF WHATSOEVER
DEGREE SAID A WORD THAT HE DIDNT APPROVE OF HE INSTANTLY REQUIRED TO
HAVE IT TAKEN DOWN IF ANYBODY WOULDNT MAKE AN ADMISSION HE SAID
ILL HAVE IT OUT OF YOU AND IF ANYBODY MADE AN ADMISSION HE SAID
NOW I HAVE GOT YOU THE MAGISTRATES SHIVERED UNDER A SINGLE BITE OF
HIS FINGER THIEVES AND THIEFTAKERS HUNG IN DREAD RAPTURE ON HIS
WORDS AND SHRANK WHEN A HAIR OF HIS EYEBROWS TURNED IN THEIR
DIRECTION WHICH SIDE HE WAS ON I COULDNT MAKE OUT FOR HE SEEMED TO
ME TO BE GRINDING THE WHOLE PLACE IN A MILL I ONLY KNOW THAT WHEN I
STOLE OUT ON TIPTOE HE WAS NOT ON THE SIDE OF THE BENCH FOR HE WAS
MAKING THE LEGS OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO PRESIDED QUITE CONVULSIVE
UNDER THE TABLE BY HIS DENUNCIATIONS OF HIS CONDUCT AS THE
REPRESENTATIVE OF BRITISH LAW AND JUSTICE IN THAT CHAIR THAT DAY




CHAPTER XXV


BENTLEY DRUMMLE WHO WAS SO SULKY A FELLOW THAT HE EVEN TOOK UP A BOOK
AS IF ITS WRITER HAD DONE HIM AN INJURY DID NOT TAKE UP AN
ACQUAINTANCE IN A MORE AGREEABLE SPIRIT HEAVY IN FIGURE MOVEMENT AND
COMPREHENSIONIN THE SLUGGISH COMPLEXION OF HIS FACE AND IN THE
LARGE AWKWARD TONGUE THAT SEEMED TO LOLL ABOUT IN HIS MOUTH AS HE
HIMSELF LOLLED ABOUT IN A ROOMHE WAS IDLE PROUD NIGGARDLY
RESERVED AND SUSPICIOUS HE CAME OF RICH PEOPLE DOWN IN SOMERSETSHIRE
WHO HAD NURSED THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES UNTIL THEY MADE THE
DISCOVERY THAT IT WAS JUST OF AGE AND A BLOCKHEAD THUS BENTLEY
DRUMMLE HAD COME TO MR POCKET WHEN HE WAS A HEAD TALLER THAN THAT
GENTLEMAN AND HALF A DOZEN HEADS THICKER THAN MOST GENTLEMEN

STARTOP HAD BEEN SPOILT BY A WEAK MOTHER AND KEPT AT HOME WHEN HE OUGHT
TO HAVE BEEN AT SCHOOL BUT HE WAS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HER AND
ADMIRED HER BEYOND MEASURE HE HAD A WOMANS DELICACY OF FEATURE AND
WASAS YOU MAY SEE THOUGH YOU NEVER SAW HER SAID HERBERT TO
MEEXACTLY LIKE HIS MOTHER IT WAS BUT NATURAL THAT I SHOULD TAKE TO
HIM MUCH MORE KINDLY THAN TO DRUMMLE AND THAT EVEN IN THE EARLIEST
EVENINGS OF OUR BOATING HE AND I SHOULD PULL HOMEWARD ABREAST OF ONE
ANOTHER CONVERSING FROM BOAT TO BOAT WHILE BENTLEY DRUMMLE CAME UP IN
OUR WAKE ALONE UNDER THE OVERHANGING BANKS AND AMONG THE RUSHES HE
WOULD ALWAYS CREEP INSHORE LIKE SOME UNCOMFORTABLE AMPHIBIOUS
CREATURE EVEN WHEN THE TIDE WOULD HAVE SENT HIM FAST UPON HIS WAY AND
I ALWAYS THINK OF HIM AS COMING AFTER US IN THE DARK OR BY THE
BACKWATER WHEN OUR OWN TWO BOATS WERE BREAKING THE SUNSET OR THE
MOONLIGHT IN MIDSTREAM

HERBERT WAS MY INTIMATE COMPANION AND FRIEND I PRESENTED HIM WITH A
HALFSHARE IN MY BOAT WHICH WAS THE OCCASION OF HIS OFTEN COMING DOWN
TO HAMMERSMITH AND MY POSSESSION OF A HALFSHARE IN HIS CHAMBERS OFTEN
TOOK ME UP TO LONDON WE USED TO WALK BETWEEN THE TWO PLACES AT ALL
HOURS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR THE ROAD YET THOUGH IT IS NOT SO
PLEASANT A ROAD AS IT WAS THEN FORMED IN THE IMPRESSIBILITY OF
UNTRIED YOUTH AND HOPE

WHEN I HAD BEEN IN MR POCKETS FAMILY A MONTH OR TWO MR AND MRS
CAMILLA TURNED UP CAMILLA WAS MR POCKETS SISTER GEORGIANA WHOM I
HAD SEEN AT MISS HAVISHAMS ON THE SAME OCCASION ALSO TURNED UP SHE
WAS A COUSINAN INDIGESTIVE SINGLE WOMAN WHO CALLED HER RIGIDITY
RELIGION AND HER LIVER LOVE THESE PEOPLE HATED ME WITH THE HATRED OF
CUPIDITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT AS A MATTER OF COURSE THEY FAWNED UPON ME
IN MY PROSPERITY WITH THE BASEST MEANNESS TOWARDS MR POCKET AS A
GROWNUP INFANT WITH NO NOTION OF HIS OWN INTERESTS THEY SHOWED THE
COMPLACENT FORBEARANCE I HAD HEARD THEM EXPRESS MRS POCKET THEY HELD
IN CONTEMPT BUT THEY ALLOWED THE POOR SOUL TO HAVE BEEN HEAVILY
DISAPPOINTED IN LIFE BECAUSE THAT SHED A FEEBLE REFLECTED LIGHT UPON
THEMSELVES

THESE WERE THE SURROUNDINGS AMONG WHICH I SETTLED DOWN AND APPLIED
MYSELF TO MY EDUCATION I SOON CONTRACTED EXPENSIVE HABITS AND BEGAN
TO SPEND AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WITHIN A FEW SHORT MONTHS I SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT ALMOST FABULOUS BUT THROUGH GOOD AND EVIL I STUCK TO MY
BOOKS THERE WAS NO OTHER MERIT IN THIS THAN MY HAVING SENSE ENOUGH TO
FEEL MY DEFICIENCIES BETWEEN MR POCKET AND HERBERT I GOT ON FAST
AND WITH ONE OR THE OTHER ALWAYS AT MY ELBOW TO GIVE ME THE START I
WANTED AND CLEAR OBSTRUCTIONS OUT OF MY ROAD I MUST HAVE BEEN AS
GREAT A DOLT AS DRUMMLE IF I HAD DONE LESS

I HAD NOT SEEN MR WEMMICK FOR SOME WEEKS WHEN I THOUGHT I WOULD WRITE
HIM A NOTE AND PROPOSE TO GO HOME WITH HIM ON A CERTAIN EVENING HE
REPLIED THAT IT WOULD GIVE HIM MUCH PLEASURE AND THAT HE WOULD EXPECT
ME AT THE OFFICE AT SIX OCLOCK THITHER I WENT AND THERE I FOUND HIM
PUTTING THE KEY OF HIS SAFE DOWN HIS BACK AS THE CLOCK STRUCK

DID YOU THINK OF WALKING DOWN TO WALWORTH SAID HE

CERTAINLY SAID I IF YOU APPROVE

VERY MUCH WAS WEMMICKS REPLY FOR I HAVE HAD MY LEGS UNDER THE
DESK ALL DAY AND SHALL BE GLAD TO STRETCH THEM NOW ILL TELL YOU
WHAT I HAVE GOT FOR SUPPER MR PIP I HAVE GOT A STEWED STEAKWHICH

COOKSSHOP I THINK ITS TENDER BECAUSE THE MASTER OF THE SHOP WAS A
JURYMAN IN SOME CASES OF OURS THE OTHER DAY AND WE LET HIM DOWN EASY
I REMINDED HIM OF IT WHEN I BOUGHT THE FOWL AND I SAID PICK US OUT A
GOOD ONE OLD BRITON BECAUSE IF WE HAD CHOSEN TO KEEP YOU IN THE BOX
ANOTHER DAY OR TWO WE COULD EASILY HAVE DONE IT HE SAID TO THAT
LET ME MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF THE BEST FOWL IN THE SHOP I LET HIM OF
COURSE AS FAR AS IT GOES ITS PROPERTY AND PORTABLE YOU DONT OBJECT
TO AN AGED PARENT I HOPE

I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS STILL SPEAKING OF THE FOWL UNTIL HE ADDED
BECAUSE I HAVE GOT AN AGED PARENT AT MY PLACE I THEN SAID WHAT
POLITENESS REQUIRED

SO YOU HAVENT DINED WITH MR JAGGERS YET HE PURSUED AS WE WALKED
ALONG

YOULL HAVE AN INVITATION TOMORROW HES GOING TO ASK YOUR PALS TOO

ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF COUNTING DRUMMLE AS ONE OF MY
INTIMATE ASSOCIATES I ANSWERED YES

WELL HES GOING TO ASK THE WHOLE GANGI HARDLY FELT COMPLIMENTED BY
THE WORDAND WHATEVER HE GIVES YOU HELL GIVE YOU GOOD DONT LOOK
FORWARD TO VARIETY BUT YOULL HAVE EXCELLENCE AND THERES ANOTHER RUM
THING IN HIS HOUSE PROCEEDED WEMMICK AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE AS IF
THE REMARK FOLLOWED ON THE HOUSEKEEPER UNDERSTOOD HE NEVER LETS A
DOOR OR WINDOW BE FASTENED AT NIGHT

IS HE NEVER ROBBED

THATS IT RETURNED WEMMICK HE SAYS AND GIVES IT OUT PUBLICLY I
WANT TO SEE THE MAN WHOLL ROB ME LORD BLESS YOU I HAVE HEARD HIM
A HUNDRED TIMES IF I HAVE HEARD HIM ONCE SAY TO REGULAR CRACKSMEN IN
OUR FRONT OFFICE YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE NOW NO BOLT IS EVER DRAWN
THERE WHY DONT YOU DO A STROKE OF BUSINESS WITH ME COME CANT I
TEMPT YOU NOT A MAN OF THEM SIR WOULD BE BOLD ENOUGH TO TRY IT ON
FOR LOVE OR MONEY

THEY DREAD HIM SO MUCH SAID I

DREAD HIM SAID WEMMICK I BELIEVE YOU THEY DREAD HIM NOT BUT WHAT
HES ARTFUL EVEN IN HIS DEFIANCE OF THEM NO SILVER SIR BRITANNIA
METAL EVERY SPOON

SO THEY WOULDNT HAVE MUCH I OBSERVED EVEN IF THEY

AH BUT HE WOULD HAVE MUCH SAID WEMMICK CUTTING ME SHORT AND
THEY KNOW IT HED HAVE THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF SCORES OF EM
HED HAVE ALL HE COULD GET AND ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT HE COULDNT
GET IF HE GAVE HIS MIND TO IT

I WAS FALLING INTO MEDITATION ON MY GUARDIANS GREATNESS WHEN WEMMICK
REMARKED

AS TO THE ABSENCE OF PLATE THATS ONLY HIS NATURAL DEPTH YOU KNOW A
RIVERS ITS NATURAL DEPTH AND HES HIS NATURAL DEPTH LOOK AT HIS
WATCHCHAIN THATS REAL ENOUGH

ITS VERY MASSIVE SAID I

MASSIVE REPEATED WEMMICK I THINK SO AND HIS WATCH IS A GOLD
REPEATER AND WORTH A HUNDRED POUND IF ITS WORTH A PENNY MR PIP
THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THIEVES IN THIS TOWN WHO KNOW ALL ABOUT
THAT WATCH THERES NOT A MAN A WOMAN OR A CHILD AMONG THEM WHO
WOULDNT IDENTIFY THE SMALLEST LINK IN THAT CHAIN AND DROP IT AS IF IT
WAS RED HOT IF INVEIGLED INTO TOUCHING IT

AT FIRST WITH SUCH DISCOURSE AND AFTERWARDS WITH CONVERSATION OF A
MORE GENERAL NATURE DID MR WEMMICK AND I BEGUILE THE TIME AND THE
ROAD UNTIL HE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAD ARRIVED IN THE
DISTRICT OF WALWORTH

IT APPEARED TO BE A COLLECTION OF BACK LANES DITCHES AND LITTLE
GARDENS AND TO PRESENT THE ASPECT OF A RATHER DULL RETIREMENT
WEMMICKS HOUSE WAS A LITTLE WOODEN COTTAGE IN THE MIDST OF PLOTS OF
GARDEN AND THE TOP OF IT WAS CUT OUT AND PAINTED LIKE A BATTERY
MOUNTED WITH GUNS

MY OWN DOING SAID WEMMICK LOOKS PRETTY DONT IT

I HIGHLY COMMENDED IT I THINK IT WAS THE SMALLEST HOUSE I EVER SAW
WITH THE QUEEREST GOTHIC WINDOWS BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF THEM
SHAM AND A GOTHIC DOOR ALMOST TOO SMALL TO GET IN AT

THATS A REAL FLAGSTAFF YOU SEE SAID WEMMICK AND ON SUNDAYS I RUN
UP A REAL FLAG THEN LOOK HERE AFTER I HAVE CROSSED THIS BRIDGE I
HOIST IT UPSOAND CUT OFF THE COMMUNICATION

THE BRIDGE WAS A PLANK AND IT CROSSED A CHASM ABOUT FOUR FEET WIDE AND
TWO DEEP BUT IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO SEE THE PRIDE WITH WHICH HE
HOISTED IT UP AND MADE IT FAST SMILING AS HE DID SO WITH A RELISH AND
NOT MERELY MECHANICALLY

AT NINE OCLOCK EVERY NIGHT GREENWICH TIME SAID WEMMICK THE GUN
FIRES THERE HE IS YOU SEE AND WHEN YOU HEAR HIM GO I THINK YOULL
SAY HES A STINGER

THE PIECE OF ORDNANCE REFERRED TO WAS MOUNTED IN A SEPARATE FORTRESS
CONSTRUCTED OF LATTICEWORK IT WAS PROTECTED FROM THE WEATHER BY AN
INGENIOUS LITTLE TARPAULIN CONTRIVANCE IN THE NATURE OF AN UMBRELLA

THEN AT THE BACK SAID WEMMICK OUT OF SIGHT SO AS NOT TO IMPEDE
THE IDEA OF FORTIFICATIONSFOR ITS A PRINCIPLE WITH ME IF YOU HAVE
AN IDEA CARRY IT OUT AND KEEP IT UPI DONT KNOW WHETHER THATS YOUR
OPINION

I SAID DECIDEDLY

AT THE BACK THERES A PIG AND THERE ARE FOWLS AND RABBITS THEN I
KNOCK TOGETHER MY OWN LITTLE FRAME YOU SEE AND GROW CUCUMBERS AND
YOULL JUDGE AT SUPPER WHAT SORT OF A SALAD I CAN RAISE SO SIR SAID
WEMMICK SMILING AGAIN BUT SERIOUSLY TOO AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD IF
YOU CAN SUPPOSE THE LITTLE PLACE BESIEGED IT WOULD HOLD OUT A DEVIL OF
A TIME IN POINT OF PROVISIONS

THEN HE CONDUCTED ME TO A BOWER ABOUT A DOZEN YARDS OFF BUT WHICH WAS
APPROACHED BY SUCH INGENIOUS TWISTS OF PATH THAT IT TOOK QUITE A LONG
TIME TO GET AT AND IN THIS RETREAT OUR GLASSES WERE ALREADY SET FORTH
OUR PUNCH WAS COOLING IN AN ORNAMENTAL LAKE ON WHOSE MARGIN THE BOWER
WAS RAISED THIS PIECE OF WATER WITH AN ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE WHICH
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SALAD FOR SUPPER WAS OF A CIRCULAR FORM AND HE
HAD CONSTRUCTED A FOUNTAIN IN IT WHICH WHEN YOU SET A LITTLE MILL
GOING AND TOOK A CORK OUT OF A PIPE PLAYED TO THAT POWERFUL EXTENT
THAT IT MADE THE BACK OF YOUR HAND QUITE WET

I AM MY OWN ENGINEER AND MY OWN CARPENTER AND MY OWN PLUMBER AND MY
OWN GARDENER AND MY OWN JACK OF ALL TRADES SAID WEMMICK IN
ACKNOWLEDGING MY COMPLIMENTS WELL ITS A GOOD THING YOU KNOW IT
BRUSHES THE NEWGATE COBWEBS AWAY AND PLEASES THE AGED YOU WOULDNT
MIND BEING AT ONCE INTRODUCED TO THE AGED WOULD YOU IT WOULDNT PUT
YOU OUT

I EXPRESSED THE READINESS I FELT AND WE WENT INTO THE CASTLE THERE WE
FOUND SITTING BY A FIRE A VERY OLD MAN IN A FLANNEL COAT CLEAN
CHEERFUL COMFORTABLE AND WELL CARED FOR BUT INTENSELY DEAF

WELL AGED PARENT SAID WEMMICK SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM IN A CORDIAL
AND JOCOSE WAY HOW AM YOU

ALL RIGHT JOHN ALL RIGHT REPLIED THE OLD MAN

HERES MR PIP AGED PARENT SAID WEMMICK AND I WISH YOU COULD HEAR
HIS NAME NOD AWAY AT HIM MR PIP THATS WHAT HE LIKES NOD AWAY AT
HIM IF YOU PLEASE LIKE WINKING

THIS IS A FINE PLACE OF MY SONS SIR CRIED THE OLD MAN WHILE I
NODDED AS HARD AS I POSSIBLY COULD THIS IS A PRETTY PLEASUREGROUND
SIR THIS SPOT AND THESE BEAUTIFUL WORKS UPON IT OUGHT TO BE KEPT
TOGETHER BY THE NATION AFTER MY SONS TIME FOR THE PEOPLES
ENJOYMENT

YOURE AS PROUD OF IT AS PUNCH AINT YOU AGED SAID WEMMICK
CONTEMPLATING THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HARD FACE REALLY SOFTENED
THERES A NOD FOR YOU GIVING HIM A TREMENDOUS ONE THERES
ANOTHER FOR YOU GIVING HIM A STILL MORE TREMENDOUS ONE YOU LIKE
THAT DONT YOU IF YOURE NOT TIRED MR PIPTHOUGH I KNOW ITS TIRING
TO STRANGERSWILL YOU TIP HIM ONE MORE YOU CANT THINK HOW IT PLEASES
HIM

I TIPPED HIM SEVERAL MORE AND HE WAS IN GREAT SPIRITS WE LEFT HIM
BESTIRRING HIMSELF TO FEED THE FOWLS AND WE SAT DOWN TO OUR PUNCH IN
THE ARBOUR WHERE WEMMICK TOLD ME AS HE SMOKED A PIPE THAT IT HAD
TAKEN HIM A GOOD MANY YEARS TO BRING THE PROPERTY UP TO ITS PRESENT
PITCH OF PERFECTION

IS IT YOUR OWN MR WEMMICK

O YES SAID WEMMICK I HAVE GOT HOLD OF IT A BIT AT A TIME ITS A
FREEHOLD BY GEORGE

IS IT INDEED I HOPE MR JAGGERS ADMIRES IT

NEVER SEEN IT SAID WEMMICK NEVER HEARD OF IT NEVER SEEN THE AGED
NEVER HEARD OF HIM NO THE OFFICE IS ONE THING AND PRIVATE LIFE IS
ANOTHER WHEN I GO INTO THE OFFICE I LEAVE THE CASTLE BEHIND ME AND
WHEN I COME INTO THE CASTLE I LEAVE THE OFFICE BEHIND ME IF ITS NOT
IN ANY WAY DISAGREEABLE TO YOU YOULL OBLIGE ME BY DOING THE SAME I
DONT WISH IT PROFESSIONALLY SPOKEN ABOUT

OF COURSE I FELT MY GOOD FAITH INVOLVED IN THE OBSERVANCE OF HIS
REQUEST THE PUNCH BEING VERY NICE WE SAT THERE DRINKING IT AND
TALKING UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST NINE OCLOCK GETTING NEAR GUNFIRE
SAID WEMMICK THEN AS HE LAID DOWN HIS PIPE ITS THE AGEDS TREAT

PROCEEDING INTO THE CASTLE AGAIN WE FOUND THE AGED HEATING THE POKER
WITH EXPECTANT EYES AS A PRELIMINARY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS GREAT
NIGHTLY CEREMONY WEMMICK STOOD WITH HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND UNTIL THE
MOMENT WAS COME FOR HIM TO TAKE THE REDHOT POKER FROM THE AGED AND
REPAIR TO THE BATTERY HE TOOK IT AND WENT OUT AND PRESENTLY THE
STINGER WENT OFF WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE CRAZY LITTLE BOX OF A
COTTAGE AS IF IT MUST FALL TO PIECES AND MADE EVERY GLASS AND TEACUP
IN IT RING UPON THIS THE AGEDWHO I BELIEVE WOULD HAVE BEEN BLOWN OUT
OF HIS ARMCHAIR BUT FOR HOLDING ON BY THE ELBOWSCRIED OUT EXULTINGLY
HES FIRED I HEERD HIM AND I NODDED AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN UNTIL IT
IS NO FIGURE OF SPEECH TO DECLARE THAT I ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT SEE HIM

THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THAT TIME AND SUPPER WEMMICK DEVOTED TO SHOWING ME
HIS COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES THEY WERE MOSTLY OF A FELONIOUS
CHARACTER COMPRISING THE PEN WITH WHICH A CELEBRATED FORGERY HAD BEEN
COMMITTED A DISTINGUISHED RAZOR OR TWO SOME LOCKS OF HAIR AND
SEVERAL MANUSCRIPT CONFESSIONS WRITTEN UNDER CONDEMNATIONUPON WHICH
MR WEMMICK SET PARTICULAR VALUE AS BEING TO USE HIS OWN WORDS EVERY
ONE OF EM LIES SIR THESE WERE AGREEABLY DISPERSED AMONG SMALL
SPECIMENS OF CHINA AND GLASS VARIOUS NEAT TRIFLES MADE BY THE
PROPRIETOR OF THE MUSEUM AND SOME TOBACCOSTOPPERS CARVED BY THE AGED
THEY WERE ALL DISPLAYED IN THAT CHAMBER OF THE CASTLE INTO WHICH I HAD
BEEN FIRST INDUCTED AND WHICH SERVED NOT ONLY AS THE GENERAL
SITTINGROOM BUT AS THE KITCHEN TOO IF I MIGHT JUDGE FROM A SAUCEPAN
ON THE HOB AND A BRAZEN BIJOU OVER THE FIREPLACE DESIGNED FOR THE
SUSPENSION OF A ROASTINGJACK

THERE WAS A NEAT LITTLE GIRL IN ATTENDANCE WHO LOOKED AFTER THE AGED
IN THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD LAID THE SUPPERCLOTH THE BRIDGE WAS LOWERED
TO GIVE HER MEANS OF EGRESS AND SHE WITHDREW FOR THE NIGHT THE SUPPER
WAS EXCELLENT AND THOUGH THE CASTLE WAS RATHER SUBJECT TO DRYROT
INSOMUCH THAT IT TASTED LIKE A BAD NUT AND THOUGH THE PIG MIGHT HAVE
BEEN FARTHER OFF I WAS HEARTILY PLEASED WITH MY WHOLE ENTERTAINMENT
NOR WAS THERE ANY DRAWBACK ON MY LITTLE TURRET BEDROOM BEYOND THERE
BEING SUCH A VERY THIN CEILING BETWEEN ME AND THE FLAGSTAFF THAT WHEN
I LAY DOWN ON MY BACK IN BED IT SEEMED AS IF I HAD TO BALANCE THAT
POLE ON MY FOREHEAD ALL NIGHT

WEMMICK WAS UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM AFRAID I HEARD HIM
CLEANING MY BOOTS AFTER THAT HE FELL TO GARDENING AND I SAW HIM FROM
MY GOTHIC WINDOW PRETENDING TO EMPLOY THE AGED AND NODDING AT HIM IN A
MOST DEVOTED MANNER OUR BREAKFAST WAS AS GOOD AS THE SUPPER AND AT
HALFPAST EIGHT PRECISELY WE STARTED FOR LITTLE BRITAIN BY DEGREES
WEMMICK GOT DRYER AND HARDER AS WE WENT ALONG AND HIS MOUTH TIGHTENED
INTO A POSTOFFICE AGAIN AT LAST WHEN WE GOT TO HIS PLACE OF BUSINESS
AND HE PULLED OUT HIS KEY FROM HIS COATCOLLAR HE LOOKED AS
UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS WALWORTH PROPERTY AS IF THE CASTLE AND THE
DRAWBRIDGE AND THE ARBOUR AND THE LAKE AND THE FOUNTAIN AND THE AGED
HAD ALL BEEN BLOWN INTO SPACE TOGETHER BY THE LAST DISCHARGE OF THE
STINGER




CHAPTER XXVI


IT FELL OUT AS WEMMICK HAD TOLD ME IT WOULD THAT I HAD AN EARLY
OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING MY GUARDIANS ESTABLISHMENT WITH THAT OF HIS
CASHIER AND CLERK MY GUARDIAN WAS IN HIS ROOM WASHING HIS HANDS WITH
HIS SCENTED SOAP WHEN I WENT INTO THE OFFICE FROM WALWORTH AND HE
CALLED ME TO HIM AND GAVE ME THE INVITATION FOR MYSELF AND FRIENDS
WHICH WEMMICK HAD PREPARED ME TO RECEIVE NO CEREMONY HE STIPULATED
AND NO DINNER DRESS AND SAY TOMORROW I ASKED HIM WHERE WE SHOULD
COME TO FOR I HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE LIVED AND I BELIEVE IT WAS IN HIS
GENERAL OBJECTION TO MAKE ANYTHING LIKE AN ADMISSION THAT HE REPLIED
COME HERE AND ILL TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME I EMBRACE THIS OPPORTUNITY
OF REMARKING THAT HE WASHED HIS CLIENTS OFF AS IF HE WERE A SURGEON OR
A DENTIST HE HAD A CLOSET IN HIS ROOM FITTED UP FOR THE PURPOSE
WHICH SMELT OF THE SCENTED SOAP LIKE A PERFUMERS SHOP IT HAD AN
UNUSUALLY LARGE JACKTOWEL ON A ROLLER INSIDE THE DOOR AND HE WOULD
WASH HIS HANDS AND WIPE THEM AND DRY THEM ALL OVER THIS TOWEL
WHENEVER HE CAME IN FROM A POLICE COURT OR DISMISSED A CLIENT FROM HIS
ROOM WHEN I AND MY FRIENDS REPAIRED TO HIM AT SIX OCLOCK NEXT DAY HE
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENGAGED ON A CASE OF A DARKER COMPLEXION THAN
USUAL FOR WE FOUND HIM WITH HIS HEAD BUTTED INTO THIS CLOSET NOT ONLY
WASHING HIS HANDS BUT LAVING HIS FACE AND GARGLING HIS THROAT AND
EVEN WHEN HE HAD DONE ALL THAT AND HAD GONE ALL ROUND THE JACKTOWEL
HE TOOK OUT HIS PENKNIFE AND SCRAPED THE CASE OUT OF HIS NAILS BEFORE
HE PUT HIS COAT ON

THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE SLINKING ABOUT AS USUAL WHEN WE PASSED OUT INTO
THE STREET WHO WERE EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO SPEAK WITH HIM BUT THERE WAS
SOMETHING SO CONCLUSIVE IN THE HALO OF SCENTED SOAP WHICH ENCIRCLED HIS
PRESENCE THAT THEY GAVE IT UP FOR THAT DAY AS WE WALKED ALONG
WESTWARD HE WAS RECOGNISED EVER AND AGAIN BY SOME FACE IN THE CROWD OF
THE STREETS AND WHENEVER THAT HAPPENED HE TALKED LOUDER TO ME BUT HE
NEVER OTHERWISE RECOGNISED ANYBODY OR TOOK NOTICE THAT ANYBODY
RECOGNISED HIM

HE CONDUCTED US TO GERRARD STREET SOHO TO A HOUSE ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF THAT STREET RATHER A STATELY HOUSE OF ITS KIND BUT DOLEFULLY IN
WANT OF PAINTING AND WITH DIRTY WINDOWS HE TOOK OUT HIS KEY AND
OPENED THE DOOR AND WE ALL WENT INTO A STONE HALL BARE GLOOMY AND
LITTLE USED SO UP A DARK BROWN STAIRCASE INTO A SERIES OF THREE DARK
BROWN ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR THERE WERE CARVED GARLANDS ON THE
PANELLED WALLS AND AS HE STOOD AMONG THEM GIVING US WELCOME I KNOW
WHAT KIND OF LOOPS I THOUGHT THEY LOOKED LIKE

DINNER WAS LAID IN THE BEST OF THESE ROOMS THE SECOND WAS HIS
DRESSINGROOM THE THIRD HIS BEDROOM HE TOLD US THAT HE HELD THE
WHOLE HOUSE BUT RARELY USED MORE OF IT THAN WE SAW THE TABLE WAS
COMFORTABLY LAIDNO SILVER IN THE SERVICE OF COURSEAND AT THE SIDE OF
HIS CHAIR WAS A CAPACIOUS DUMBWAITER WITH A VARIETY OF BOTTLES AND
DECANTERS ON IT AND FOUR DISHES OF FRUIT FOR DESSERT I NOTICED
THROUGHOUT THAT HE KEPT EVERYTHING UNDER HIS OWN HAND AND DISTRIBUTED
EVERYTHING HIMSELF

THERE WAS A BOOKCASE IN THE ROOM I SAW FROM THE BACKS OF THE BOOKS
THAT THEY WERE ABOUT EVIDENCE CRIMINAL LAW CRIMINAL BIOGRAPHY
TRIALS ACTS OF PARLIAMENT AND SUCH THINGS THE FURNITURE WAS ALL VERY
SOLID AND GOOD LIKE HIS WATCHCHAIN IT HAD AN OFFICIAL LOOK HOWEVER
AND THERE WAS NOTHING MERELY ORNAMENTAL TO BE SEEN IN A CORNER WAS A
LITTLE TABLE OF PAPERS WITH A SHADED LAMP SO THAT HE SEEMED TO BRING
THE OFFICE HOME WITH HIM IN THAT RESPECT TOO AND TO WHEEL IT OUT OF AN
EVENING AND FALL TO WORK

AS HE HAD SCARCELY SEEN MY THREE COMPANIONS UNTIL NOWFOR HE AND I HAD
WALKED TOGETHERHE STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG AFTER RINGING THE BELL
AND TOOK A SEARCHING LOOK AT THEM TO MY SURPRISE HE SEEMED AT ONCE TO
BE PRINCIPALLY IF NOT SOLELY INTERESTED IN DRUMMLE

PIP SAID HE PUTTING HIS LARGE HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND MOVING ME TO
THE WINDOW I DONT KNOW ONE FROM THE OTHER WHOS THE SPIDER

THE SPIDER SAID I

THE BLOTCHY SPRAWLY SULKY FELLOW

THATS BENTLEY DRUMMLE I REPLIED THE ONE WITH THE DELICATE FACE IS
STARTOP

NOT MAKING THE LEAST ACCOUNT OF THE ONE WITH THE DELICATE FACE HE
RETURNED BENTLEY DRUMMLE IS HIS NAME IS IT I LIKE THE LOOK OF THAT
FELLOW

HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO TALK TO DRUMMLE NOT AT ALL DETERRED BY HIS
REPLYING IN HIS HEAVY RETICENT WAY BUT APPARENTLY LED ON BY IT TO
SCREW DISCOURSE OUT OF HIM I WAS LOOKING AT THE TWO WHEN THERE CAME
BETWEEN ME AND THEM THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH THE FIRST DISH FOR THE TABLE

SHE WAS A WOMAN OF ABOUT FORTY I SUPPOSEDBUT I MAY HAVE THOUGHT HER
YOUNGER THAN SHE WAS RATHER TALL OF A LITHE NIMBLE FIGURE EXTREMELY
PALE WITH LARGE FADED EYES AND A QUANTITY OF STREAMING HAIR I CANNOT
SAY WHETHER ANY DISEASED AFFECTION OF THE HEART CAUSED HER LIPS TO BE
PARTED AS IF SHE WERE PANTING AND HER FACE TO BEAR A CURIOUS
EXPRESSION OF SUDDENNESS AND FLUTTER BUT I KNOW THAT I HAD BEEN TO SEE
MACBETH AT THE THEATRE A NIGHT OR TWO BEFORE AND THAT HER FACE LOOKED
TO ME AS IF IT WERE ALL DISTURBED BY FIERY AIR LIKE THE FACES I HAD
SEEN RISE OUT OF THE WITCHES CALDRON

SHE SET THE DISH ON TOUCHED MY GUARDIAN QUIETLY ON THE ARM WITH A
FINGER TO NOTIFY THAT DINNER WAS READY AND VANISHED WE TOOK OUR SEATS
AT THE ROUND TABLE AND MY GUARDIAN KEPT DRUMMLE ON ONE SIDE OF HIM
WHILE STARTOP SAT ON THE OTHER IT WAS A NOBLE DISH OF FISH THAT THE
HOUSEKEEPER HAD PUT ON TABLE AND WE HAD A JOINT OF EQUALLY CHOICE
MUTTON AFTERWARDS AND THEN AN EQUALLY CHOICE BIRD SAUCES WINES ALL
THE ACCESSORIES WE WANTED AND ALL OF THE BEST WERE GIVEN OUT BY OUR
HOST FROM HIS DUMBWAITER AND WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE
TABLE HE ALWAYS PUT THEM BACK AGAIN SIMILARLY HE DEALT US CLEAN
PLATES AND KNIVES AND FORKS FOR EACH COURSE AND DROPPED THOSE JUST
DISUSED INTO TWO BASKETS ON THE GROUND BY HIS CHAIR NO OTHER ATTENDANT
THAN THE HOUSEKEEPER APPEARED SHE SET ON EVERY DISH AND I ALWAYS SAW
IN HER FACE A FACE RISING OUT OF THE CALDRON YEARS AFTERWARDS I MADE
A DREADFUL LIKENESS OF THAT WOMAN BY CAUSING A FACE THAT HAD NO OTHER
NATURAL RESEMBLANCE TO IT THAN IT DERIVED FROM FLOWING HAIR TO PASS
BEHIND A BOWL OF FLAMING SPIRITS IN A DARK ROOM

INDUCED TO TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE HOUSEKEEPER BOTH BY HER OWN
STRIKING APPEARANCE AND BY WEMMICKS PREPARATION I OBSERVED THAT
WHENEVER SHE WAS IN THE ROOM SHE KEPT HER EYES ATTENTIVELY ON MY
GUARDIAN AND THAT SHE WOULD REMOVE HER HANDS FROM ANY DISH SHE PUT
BEFORE HIM HESITATINGLY AS IF SHE DREADED HIS CALLING HER BACK AND
WANTED HIM TO SPEAK WHEN SHE WAS NIGH IF HE HAD ANYTHING TO SAY I
FANCIED THAT I COULD DETECT IN HIS MANNER A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS AND
A PURPOSE OF ALWAYS HOLDING HER IN SUSPENSE

DINNER WENT OFF GAYLY AND ALTHOUGH MY GUARDIAN SEEMED TO FOLLOW RATHER
THAN ORIGINATE SUBJECTS I KNEW THAT HE WRENCHED THE WEAKEST PART OF
OUR DISPOSITIONS OUT OF US FOR MYSELF I FOUND THAT I WAS EXPRESSING
MY TENDENCY TO LAVISH EXPENDITURE AND TO PATRONISE HERBERT AND TO
BOAST OF MY GREAT PROSPECTS BEFORE I QUITE KNEW THAT I HAD OPENED MY
LIPS IT WAS SO WITH ALL OF US BUT WITH NO ONE MORE THAN DRUMMLE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF WHOSE INCLINATION TO GIRD IN A GRUDGING AND SUSPICIOUS
WAY AT THE REST WAS SCREWED OUT OF HIM BEFORE THE FISH WAS TAKEN OFF

IT WAS NOT THEN BUT WHEN WE HAD GOT TO THE CHEESE THAT OUR
CONVERSATION TURNED UPON OUR ROWING FEATS AND THAT DRUMMLE WAS RALLIED
FOR COMING UP BEHIND OF A NIGHT IN THAT SLOW AMPHIBIOUS WAY OF HIS
DRUMMLE UPON THIS INFORMED OUR HOST THAT HE MUCH PREFERRED OUR ROOM TO
OUR COMPANY AND THAT AS TO SKILL HE WAS MORE THAN OUR MASTER AND THAT
AS TO STRENGTH HE COULD SCATTER US LIKE CHAFF BY SOME INVISIBLE
AGENCY MY GUARDIAN WOUND HIM UP TO A PITCH LITTLE SHORT OF FEROCITY
ABOUT THIS TRIFLE AND HE FELL TO BARING AND SPANNING HIS ARM TO SHOW
HOW MUSCULAR IT WAS AND WE ALL FELL TO BARING AND SPANNING OUR ARMS IN
A RIDICULOUS MANNER

NOW THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS AT THAT TIME CLEARING THE TABLE MY GUARDIAN
TAKING NO HEED OF HER BUT WITH THE SIDE OF HIS FACE TURNED FROM HER
WAS LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR BITING THE SIDE OF HIS FOREFINGER AND
SHOWING AN INTEREST IN DRUMMLE THAT TO ME WAS QUITE INEXPLICABLE
SUDDENLY HE CLAPPED HIS LARGE HAND ON THE HOUSEKEEPERS LIKE A TRAP
AS SHE STRETCHED IT ACROSS THE TABLE SO SUDDENLY AND SMARTLY DID HE DO
THIS THAT WE ALL STOPPED IN OUR FOOLISH CONTENTION

IF YOU TALK OF STRENGTH SAID MR JAGGERS ILL SHOW YOU A WRIST
MOLLY LET THEM SEE YOUR WRIST

HER ENTRAPPED HAND WAS ON THE TABLE BUT SHE HAD ALREADY PUT HER OTHER
HAND BEHIND HER WAIST MASTER SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WITH HER
EYES ATTENTIVELY AND ENTREATINGLY FIXED UPON HIM DONT

ILL SHOW YOU A WRIST REPEATED MR JAGGERS WITH AN IMMOVABLE
DETERMINATION TO SHOW IT MOLLY LET THEM SEE YOUR WRIST

MASTER SHE AGAIN MURMURED PLEASE

MOLLY SAID MR JAGGERS NOT LOOKING AT HER BUT OBSTINATELY LOOKING
AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM LET THEM SEE BOTH YOUR WRISTS
SHOW THEM COME

HE TOOK HIS HAND FROM HERS AND TURNED THAT WRIST UP ON THE TABLE SHE
BROUGHT HER OTHER HAND FROM BEHIND HER AND HELD THE TWO OUT SIDE BY
SIDE THE LAST WRIST WAS MUCH DISFIGUREDDEEPLY SCARRED AND SCARRED
ACROSS AND ACROSS WHEN SHE HELD HER HANDS OUT SHE TOOK HER EYES FROM
MR JAGGERS AND TURNED THEM WATCHFULLY ON EVERY ONE OF THE REST OF US
IN SUCCESSION

THERES POWER HERE SAID MR JAGGERS COOLLY TRACING OUT THE SINEWS
WITH HIS FOREFINGER VERY FEW MEN HAVE THE POWER OF WRIST THAT THIS
WOMAN HAS ITS REMARKABLE WHAT MERE FORCE OF GRIP THERE IS IN THESE
HANDS I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO NOTICE MANY HANDS BUT I NEVER SAW
STRONGER IN THAT RESPECT MANS OR WOMANS THAN THESE

WHILE HE SAID THESE WORDS IN A LEISURELY CRITICAL STYLE SHE CONTINUED
TO LOOK AT EVERY ONE OF US IN REGULAR SUCCESSION AS WE SAT THE MOMENT
HE CEASED SHE LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN THATLL DO MOLLY SAID MR
JAGGERS GIVING HER A SLIGHT NOD YOU HAVE BEEN ADMIRED AND CAN GO
SHE WITHDREW HER HANDS AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND MR JAGGERS
PUTTING THE DECANTERS ON FROM HIS DUMBWAITER FILLED HIS GLASS AND
PASSED ROUND THE WINE

AT HALFPAST NINE GENTLEMEN SAID HE WE MUST BREAK UP PRAY MAKE
THE BEST USE OF YOUR TIME I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU ALL MR DRUMMLE I
DRINK TO YOU

IF HIS OBJECT IN SINGLING OUT DRUMMLE WERE TO BRING HIM OUT STILL MORE
IT PERFECTLY SUCCEEDED IN A SULKY TRIUMPH DRUMMLE SHOWED HIS MOROSE
DEPRECIATION OF THE REST OF US IN A MORE AND MORE OFFENSIVE DEGREE
UNTIL HE BECAME DOWNRIGHT INTOLERABLE THROUGH ALL HIS STAGES MR
JAGGERS FOLLOWED HIM WITH THE SAME STRANGE INTEREST HE ACTUALLY SEEMED
TO SERVE AS A ZEST TO MR JAGGERSS WINE

IN OUR BOYISH WANT OF DISCRETION I DARE SAY WE TOOK TOO MUCH TO DRINK
AND I KNOW WE TALKED TOO MUCH WE BECAME PARTICULARLY HOT UPON SOME
BOORISH SNEER OF DRUMMLES TO THE EFFECT THAT WE WERE TOO FREE WITH
OUR MONEY IT LED TO MY REMARKING WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION THAT
IT CAME WITH A BAD GRACE FROM HIM TO WHOM STARTOP HAD LENT MONEY IN MY
PRESENCE BUT A WEEK OR SO BEFORE

WELL RETORTED DRUMMLE HELL BE PAID

I DONT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT HE WONT SAID I BUT IT MIGHT MAKE YOU
HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT US AND OUR MONEY I SHOULD THINK

YOU SHOULD THINK RETORTED DRUMMLE OH LORD

I DARE SAY I WENT ON MEANING TO BE VERY SEVERE THAT YOU WOULDNT
LEND MONEY TO ANY OF US IF WE WANTED IT

YOU ARE RIGHT SAID DRUMMLE I WOULDNT LEND ONE OF YOU A SIXPENCE
I WOULDNT LEND ANYBODY A SIXPENCE

RATHER MEAN TO BORROW UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I SHOULD SAY

YOU SHOULD SAY REPEATED DRUMMLE OH LORD

THIS WAS SO VERY AGGRAVATINGTHE MORE ESPECIALLY AS I FOUND MYSELF
MAKING NO WAY AGAINST HIS SURLY OBTUSENESSTHAT I SAID DISREGARDING
HERBERTS EFFORTS TO CHECK ME

COME MR DRUMMLE SINCE WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT ILL TELL YOU WHAT
PASSED BETWEEN HERBERT HERE AND ME WHEN YOU BORROWED THAT MONEY

I DONT WANT TO KNOW WHAT PASSED BETWEEN HERBERT THERE AND YOU
GROWLED DRUMMLE AND I THINK HE ADDED IN A LOWER GROWL THAT WE MIGHT
BOTH GO TO THE DEVIL AND SHAKE OURSELVES

ILL TELL YOU HOWEVER SAID I WHETHER YOU WANT TO KNOW OR NOT WE
SAID THAT AS YOU PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET VERY GLAD TO GET IT YOU SEEMED
TO BE IMMENSELY AMUSED AT HIS BEING SO WEAK AS TO LEND IT

DRUMMLE LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AND SAT LAUGHING IN OUR FACES WITH HIS HANDS
IN HIS POCKETS AND HIS ROUND SHOULDERS RAISED PLAINLY SIGNIFYING THAT
IT WAS QUITE TRUE AND THAT HE DESPISED US AS ASSES ALL

HEREUPON STARTOP TOOK HIM IN HAND THOUGH WITH A MUCH BETTER GRACE THAN
I HAD SHOWN AND EXHORTED HIM TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE STARTOP
BEING A LIVELY BRIGHT YOUNG FELLOW AND DRUMMLE BEING THE EXACT
OPPOSITE THE LATTER WAS ALWAYS DISPOSED TO RESENT HIM AS A DIRECT
PERSONAL AFFRONT HE NOW RETORTED IN A COARSE LUMPISH WAY AND STARTOP
TRIED TO TURN THE DISCUSSION ASIDE WITH SOME SMALL PLEASANTRY THAT MADE
US ALL LAUGH RESENTING THIS LITTLE SUCCESS MORE THAN ANYTHING
DRUMMLE WITHOUT ANY THREAT OR WARNING PULLED HIS HANDS OUT OF HIS
POCKETS DROPPED HIS ROUND SHOULDERS SWORE TOOK UP A LARGE GLASS AND
WOULD HAVE FLUNG IT AT HIS ADVERSARYS HEAD BUT FOR OUR ENTERTAINERS
DEXTEROUSLY SEIZING IT AT THE INSTANT WHEN IT WAS RAISED FOR THAT
PURPOSE

GENTLEMEN SAID MR JAGGERS DELIBERATELY PUTTING DOWN THE GLASS AND
HAULING OUT HIS GOLD REPEATER BY ITS MASSIVE CHAIN I AM EXCEEDINGLY
SORRY TO ANNOUNCE THAT ITS HALF PAST NINE

ON THIS HINT WE ALL ROSE TO DEPART BEFORE WE GOT TO THE STREET DOOR
STARTOP WAS CHEERILY CALLING DRUMMLE OLD BOY AS IF NOTHING HAD
HAPPENED BUT THE OLD BOY WAS SO FAR FROM RESPONDING THAT HE WOULD NOT
EVEN WALK TO HAMMERSMITH ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE WAY SO HERBERT AND I
WHO REMAINED IN TOWN SAW THEM GOING DOWN THE STREET ON OPPOSITE SIDES
STARTOP LEADING AND DRUMMLE LAGGING BEHIND IN THE SHADOW OF THE
HOUSES MUCH AS HE WAS WONT TO FOLLOW IN HIS BOAT

AS THE DOOR WAS NOT YET SHUT I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE HERBERT THERE FOR
A MOMENT AND RUN UPSTAIRS AGAIN TO SAY A WORD TO MY GUARDIAN I FOUND
HIM IN HIS DRESSINGROOM SURROUNDED BY HIS STOCK OF BOOTS ALREADY HARD
AT IT WASHING HIS HANDS OF US

I TOLD HIM I HAD COME UP AGAIN TO SAY HOW SORRY I WAS THAT ANYTHING
DISAGREEABLE SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED AND THAT I HOPED HE WOULD NOT BLAME
ME MUCH

POOH SAID HE SLUICING HIS FACE AND SPEAKING THROUGH THE
WATERDROPS ITS NOTHING PIP I LIKE THAT SPIDER THOUGH

HE HAD TURNED TOWARDS ME NOW AND WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD AND BLOWING
AND TOWELLING HIMSELF

I AM GLAD YOU LIKE HIM SIR SAID IBUT I DONT

NO NO MY GUARDIAN ASSENTED DONT HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO WITH HIM
KEEP AS CLEAR OF HIM AS YOU CAN BUT I LIKE THE FELLOW PIP HE IS ONE
OF THE TRUE SORT WHY IF I WAS A FORTUNETELLER

LOOKING OUT OF THE TOWEL HE CAUGHT MY EYE

BUT I AM NOT A FORTUNETELLER HE SAID LETTING HIS HEAD DROP INTO A
FESTOON OF TOWEL AND TOWELLING AWAY AT HIS TWO EARS YOU KNOW WHAT I
AM DONT YOU GOOD NIGHT PIP

GOOD NIGHT SIR

IN ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THAT THE SPIDERS TIME WITH MR POCKET WAS UP
FOR GOOD AND TO THE GREAT RELIEF OF ALL THE HOUSE BUT MRS POCKET HE
WENT HOME TO THE FAMILY HOLE




CHAPTER XXVII


MY DEAR MR PIP

I WRITE THIS BY REQUEST OF MR GARGERY FOR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE IS
GOING TO LONDON IN COMPANY WITH MR WOPSLE AND WOULD BE GLAD IF
AGREEABLE TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE YOU HE WOULD CALL AT BARNARDS HOTEL
TUESDAY MORNING AT NINE OCLOCK WHEN IF NOT AGREEABLE PLEASE LEAVE
WORD YOUR POOR SISTER IS MUCH THE SAME AS WHEN YOU LEFT WE TALK OF
YOU IN THE KITCHEN EVERY NIGHT AND WONDER WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND
DOING IF NOW CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF A LIBERTY EXCUSE IT FOR THE
LOVE OF POOR OLD DAYS NO MORE DEAR MR PIP FROM

YOUR EVER OBLIGED AND AFFECTIONATE SERVANT
BIDDY


PS HE WISHES ME MOST PARTICULAR TO WRITE WHAT LARKS HE SAYS YOU
WILL UNDERSTAND I HOPE AND DO NOT DOUBT IT WILL BE AGREEABLE TO SEE
HIM EVEN THOUGH A GENTLEMAN FOR YOU HAD EVER A GOOD HEART AND HE IS
A WORTHY WORTHY MAN I HAVE READ HIM ALL EXCEPTING ONLY THE LAST
LITTLE SENTENCE AND HE WISHES ME MOST PARTICULAR TO WRITE AGAIN WHAT
LARKS

I RECEIVED THIS LETTER BY THE POST ON MONDAY MORNING AND THEREFORE ITS
APPOINTMENT WAS FOR NEXT DAY LET ME CONFESS EXACTLY WITH WHAT FEELINGS
I LOOKED FORWARD TO JOES COMING

NOT WITH PLEASURE THOUGH I WAS BOUND TO HIM BY SO MANY TIES NO WITH
CONSIDERABLE DISTURBANCE SOME MORTIFICATION AND A KEEN SENSE OF
INCONGRUITY IF I COULD HAVE KEPT HIM AWAY BY PAYING MONEY I CERTAINLY
WOULD HAVE PAID MONEY MY GREATEST REASSURANCE WAS THAT HE WAS COMING
TO BARNARDS INN NOT TO HAMMERSMITH AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD NOT FALL
IN BENTLEY DRUMMLES WAY I HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO HIS BEING SEEN BY
HERBERT OR HIS FATHER FOR BOTH OF WHOM I HAD A RESPECT BUT I HAD THE
SHARPEST SENSITIVENESS AS TO HIS BEING SEEN BY DRUMMLE WHOM I HELD IN
CONTEMPT SO THROUGHOUT LIFE OUR WORST WEAKNESSES AND MEANNESSES ARE
USUALLY COMMITTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE WHOM WE MOST DESPISE

I HAD BEGUN TO BE ALWAYS DECORATING THE CHAMBERS IN SOME QUITE
UNNECESSARY AND INAPPROPRIATE WAY OR OTHER AND VERY EXPENSIVE THOSE
WRESTLES WITH BARNARD PROVED TO BE BY THIS TIME THE ROOMS WERE VASTLY
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I HAD FOUND THEM AND I ENJOYED THE HONOUR OF
OCCUPYING A FEW PROMINENT PAGES IN THE BOOKS OF A NEIGHBOURING
UPHOLSTERER I HAD GOT ON SO FAST OF LATE THAT I HAD EVEN STARTED A
BOY IN BOOTSTOP BOOTSIN BONDAGE AND SLAVERY TO WHOM I MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SAID TO PASS MY DAYS FOR AFTER I HAD MADE THE MONSTER OUT OF
THE REFUSE OF MY WASHERWOMANS FAMILY AND HAD CLOTHED HIM WITH A BLUE
COAT CANARY WAISTCOAT WHITE CRAVAT CREAMY BREECHES AND THE BOOTS
ALREADY MENTIONED I HAD TO FIND HIM A LITTLE TO DO AND A GREAT DEAL TO
EAT AND WITH BOTH OF THOSE HORRIBLE REQUIREMENTS HE HAUNTED MY
EXISTENCE

THIS AVENGING PHANTOM WAS ORDERED TO BE ON DUTY AT EIGHT ON TUESDAY
MORNING IN THE HALL IT WAS TWO FEET SQUARE AS CHARGED FOR
FLOORCLOTH AND HERBERT SUGGESTED CERTAIN THINGS FOR BREAKFAST THAT HE
THOUGHT JOE WOULD LIKE WHILE I FELT SINCERELY OBLIGED TO HIM FOR BEING
SO INTERESTED AND CONSIDERATE I HAD AN ODD HALFPROVOKED SENSE OF
SUSPICION UPON ME THAT IF JOE HAD BEEN COMING TO SEE HIM HE
WOULDNT HAVE BEEN QUITE SO BRISK ABOUT IT

HOWEVER I CAME INTO TOWN ON THE MONDAY NIGHT TO BE READY FOR JOE AND
I GOT UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND CAUSED THE SITTINGROOM AND
BREAKFASTTABLE TO ASSUME THEIR MOST SPLENDID APPEARANCE UNFORTUNATELY
THE MORNING WAS DRIZZLY AND AN ANGEL COULD NOT HAVE CONCEALED THE FACT
THAT BARNARD WAS SHEDDING SOOTY TEARS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW LIKE SOME
WEAK GIANT OF A SWEEP

AS THE TIME APPROACHED I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE AVENGER
PURSUANT TO ORDERS WAS IN THE HALL AND PRESENTLY I HEARD JOE ON THE
STAIRCASE I KNEW IT WAS JOE BY HIS CLUMSY MANNER OF COMING
UPSTAIRSHIS STATE BOOTS BEING ALWAYS TOO BIG FOR HIMAND BY THE TIME
IT TOOK HIM TO READ THE NAMES ON THE OTHER FLOORS IN THE COURSE OF HIS
ASCENT WHEN AT LAST HE STOPPED OUTSIDE OUR DOOR I COULD HEAR HIS
FINGER TRACING OVER THE PAINTED LETTERS OF MY NAME AND I AFTERWARDS
DISTINCTLY HEARD HIM BREATHING IN AT THE KEYHOLE FINALLY HE GAVE A
FAINT SINGLE RAP AND PEPPERSUCH WAS THE COMPROMISING NAME OF THE
AVENGING BOYANNOUNCED MR GARGERY I THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE
DONE WIPING HIS FEET AND THAT I MUST HAVE GONE OUT TO LIFT HIM OFF THE
MAT BUT AT LAST HE CAME IN

JOE HOW ARE YOU JOE

PIP HOW AIR YOU PIP

WITH HIS GOOD HONEST FACE ALL GLOWING AND SHINING AND HIS HAT PUT DOWN
ON THE FLOOR BETWEEN US HE CAUGHT BOTH MY HANDS AND WORKED THEM
STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AS IF I HAD BEEN THE LASTPATENTED PUMP

I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU JOE GIVE ME YOUR HAT

BUT JOE TAKING IT UP CAREFULLY WITH BOTH HANDS LIKE A BIRDSNEST
WITH EGGS IN IT WOULDNT HEAR OF PARTING WITH THAT PIECE OF PROPERTY
AND PERSISTED IN STANDING TALKING OVER IT IN A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE WAY

WHICH YOU HAVE THAT GROWED SAID JOE AND THAT SWELLED AND THAT
GENTLEFOLKED JOE CONSIDERED A LITTLE BEFORE HE DISCOVERED THIS WORD
AS TO BE SURE YOU ARE A HONOUR TO YOUR KING AND COUNTRY

AND YOU JOE LOOK WONDERFULLY WELL

THANK GOD SAID JOE IM EKERVAL TO MOST AND YOUR SISTER SHES NO
WORSE THAN SHE WERE AND BIDDY SHES EVER RIGHT AND READY AND ALL
FRIENDS IS NO BACKERDER IF NOT NO FORARDER CEPTIN WOPSLE HES HAD A
DROP

ALL THIS TIME STILL WITH BOTH HANDS TAKING GREAT CARE OF THE
BIRDSNEST JOE WAS ROLLING HIS EYES ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM AND
ROUND AND ROUND THE FLOWERED PATTERN OF MY DRESSINGGOWN

HAD A DROP JOE

WHY YES SAID JOE LOWERING HIS VOICE HES LEFT THE CHURCH AND WENT
INTO THE PLAYACTING WHICH THE PLAYACTING HAVE LIKEWAYS BROUGHT HIM TO
LONDON ALONG WITH ME AND HIS WISH WERE SAID JOE GETTING THE
BIRDSNEST UNDER HIS LEFT ARM FOR THE MOMENT AND GROPING IN IT FOR AN
EGG WITH HIS RIGHT IF NO OFFENCE AS I WOULD AND YOU THAT

I TOOK WHAT JOE GAVE ME AND FOUND IT TO BE THE CRUMPLED PLAYBILL OF A
SMALL METROPOLITAN THEATRE ANNOUNCING THE FIRST APPEARANCE IN THAT
VERY WEEK OF THE CELEBRATED PROVINCIAL AMATEUR OF ROSCIAN RENOWN
WHOSE UNIQUE PERFORMANCE IN THE HIGHEST TRAGIC WALK OF OUR NATIONAL
BARD HAS LATELY OCCASIONED SO GREAT A SENSATION IN LOCAL DRAMATIC
CIRCLES

WERE YOU AT HIS PERFORMANCE JOE I INQUIRED

I WERE SAID JOE WITH EMPHASIS AND SOLEMNITY

WAS THERE A GREAT SENSATION

WHY SAID JOE YES THERE CERTAINLY WERE A PECK OF ORANGEPEEL
PARTICKLER WHEN HE SEE THE GHOST THOUGH I PUT IT TO YOURSELF SIR
WHETHER IT WERE CALCLATED TO KEEP A MAN UP TO HIS WORK WITH A GOOD
HART TO BE CONTINIWALLY CUTTING IN BETWIXT HIM AND THE GHOST WITH
AMEN A MAN MAY HAVE HAD A MISFORTUN AND BEEN IN THE CHURCH SAID
JOE LOWERING HIS VOICE TO AN ARGUMENTATIVE AND FEELING TONE BUT THAT
IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD PUT HIM OUT AT SUCH A TIME WHICH I
MEANTERSAY IF THE GHOST OF A MANS OWN FATHER CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO
CLAIM HIS ATTENTION WHAT CAN SIR STILL MORE WHEN HIS MOURNING AT
IS UNFORTUNATELY MADE SO SMALL AS THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE BLACK FEATHERS
BRINGS IT OFF TRY TO KEEP IT ON HOW YOU MAY

A GHOSTSEEING EFFECT IN JOES OWN COUNTENANCE INFORMED ME THAT HERBERT
HAD ENTERED THE ROOM SO I PRESENTED JOE TO HERBERT WHO HELD OUT HIS
HAND BUT JOE BACKED FROM IT AND HELD ON BY THE BIRDSNEST

YOUR SERVANT SIR SAID JOE WHICH I HOPE AS YOU AND PIPHERE HIS
EYE FELL ON THE AVENGER WHO WAS PUTTING SOME TOAST ON TABLE AND SO
PLAINLY DENOTED AN INTENTION TO MAKE THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF THE
FAMILY THAT I FROWNED IT DOWN AND CONFUSED HIM MOREI MEANTERSAY YOU
TWO GENTLEMENWHICH I HOPE AS YOU GET YOUR ELTHS IN THIS CLOSE SPOT
FOR THE PRESENT MAY BE A WERRY GOOD INN ACCORDING TO LONDON OPINIONS
SAID JOE CONFIDENTIALLY AND I BELIEVE ITS CHARACTER DO STAND IT BUT
I WOULDNT KEEP A PIG IN IT MYSELFNOT IN THE CASE THAT I WISHED HIM
TO FATTEN WHOLESOME AND TO EAT WITH A MELLER FLAVOUR ON HIM

HAVING BORNE THIS FLATTERING TESTIMONY TO THE MERITS OF OUR
DWELLINGPLACE AND HAVING INCIDENTALLY SHOWN THIS TENDENCY TO CALL ME
SIR JOE BEING INVITED TO SIT DOWN TO TABLE LOOKED ALL ROUND THE
ROOM FOR A SUITABLE SPOT ON WHICH TO DEPOSIT HIS HATAS IF IT WERE
ONLY ON SOME VERY FEW RARE SUBSTANCES IN NATURE THAT IT COULD FIND A
RESTING PLACEAND ULTIMATELY STOOD IT ON AN EXTREME CORNER OF THE
CHIMNEYPIECE FROM WHICH IT EVER AFTERWARDS FELL OFF AT INTERVALS

DO YOU TAKE TEA OR COFFEE MR GARGERY ASKED HERBERT WHO ALWAYS
PRESIDED OF A MORNING

THANKEE SIR SAID JOE STIFF FROM HEAD TO FOOT ILL TAKE WHICHEVER
IS MOST AGREEABLE TO YOURSELF

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO COFFEE

THANKEE SIR RETURNED JOE EVIDENTLY DISPIRITED BY THE PROPOSAL
SINCE YOU ARE SO KIND AS MAKE CHICE OF COFFEE I WILL NOT RUN
CONTRAIRY TO YOUR OWN OPINIONS BUT DONT YOU NEVER FIND IT A LITTLE
EATING

SAY TEA THEN SAID HERBERT POURING IT OUT

HERE JOES HAT TUMBLED OFF THE MANTELPIECE AND HE STARTED OUT OF HIS
CHAIR AND PICKED IT UP AND FITTED IT TO THE SAME EXACT SPOT AS IF IT
WERE AN ABSOLUTE POINT OF GOOD BREEDING THAT IT SHOULD TUMBLE OFF AGAIN
SOON

WHEN DID YOU COME TO TOWN MR GARGERY

WERE IT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SAID JOE AFTER COUGHING BEHIND HIS
HAND AS IF HE HAD HAD TIME TO CATCH THE WHOOPINGCOUGH SINCE HE CAME
NO IT WERE NOT YES IT WERE YES IT WERE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WITH
AN APPEARANCE OF MINGLED WISDOM RELIEF AND STRICT IMPARTIALITY

HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING OF LONDON YET

WHY YES SIR SAID JOE ME AND WOPSLE WENT OFF STRAIGHT TO LOOK AT
THE BLACKING WAREUS BUT WE DIDNT FIND THAT IT COME UP TO ITS
LIKENESS IN THE RED BILLS AT THE SHOP DOORS WHICH I MEANTERSAY ADDED
JOE IN AN EXPLANATORY MANNER AS IT IS THERE DRAWD TOO
ARCHITECTOORALOORAL

I REALLY BELIEVE JOE WOULD HAVE PROLONGED THIS WORD MIGHTILY
EXPRESSIVE TO MY MIND OF SOME ARCHITECTURE THAT I KNOW INTO A PERFECT
CHORUS BUT FOR HIS ATTENTION BEING PROVIDENTIALLY ATTRACTED BY HIS
HAT WHICH WAS TOPPLING INDEED IT DEMANDED FROM HIM A CONSTANT
ATTENTION AND A QUICKNESS OF EYE AND HAND VERY LIKE THAT EXACTED BY
WICKETKEEPING HE MADE EXTRAORDINARY PLAY WITH IT AND SHOWED THE
GREATEST SKILL NOW RUSHING AT IT AND CATCHING IT NEATLY AS IT
DROPPED NOW MERELY STOPPING IT MIDWAY BEATING IT UP AND HUMOURING
IT IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ROOM AND AGAINST A GOOD DEAL OF THE PATTERN
OF THE PAPER ON THE WALL BEFORE HE FELT IT SAFE TO CLOSE WITH IT
FINALLY SPLASHING IT INTO THE SLOPBASIN WHERE I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF
LAYING HANDS UPON IT

ILLUSTRATION

AS TO HIS SHIRTCOLLAR AND HIS COATCOLLAR THEY WERE PERPLEXING TO
REFLECT UPONINSOLUBLE MYSTERIES BOTH WHY SHOULD A MAN SCRAPE HIMSELF
TO THAT EXTENT BEFORE HE COULD CONSIDER HIMSELF FULL DRESSED WHY
SHOULD HE SUPPOSE IT NECESSARY TO BE PURIFIED BY SUFFERING FOR HIS
HOLIDAY CLOTHES THEN HE FELL INTO SUCH UNACCOUNTABLE FITS OF
MEDITATION WITH HIS FORK MIDWAY BETWEEN HIS PLATE AND HIS MOUTH HAD
HIS EYES ATTRACTED IN SUCH STRANGE DIRECTIONS WAS AFFLICTED WITH SUCH
REMARKABLE COUGHS SAT SO FAR FROM THE TABLE AND DROPPED SO MUCH MORE
THAN HE ATE AND PRETENDED THAT HE HADNT DROPPED IT THAT I WAS
HEARTILY GLAD WHEN HERBERT LEFT US FOR THE CITY

I HAD NEITHER THE GOOD SENSE NOR THE GOOD FEELING TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS
ALL MY FAULT AND THAT IF I HAD BEEN EASIER WITH JOE JOE WOULD HAVE
BEEN EASIER WITH ME I FELT IMPATIENT OF HIM AND OUT OF TEMPER WITH
HIM IN WHICH CONDITION HE HEAPED COALS OF FIRE ON MY HEAD

US TWO BEING NOW ALONE SIRBEGAN JOE

JOE I INTERRUPTED PETTISHLY HOW CAN YOU CALL ME SIR

JOE LOOKED AT ME FOR A SINGLE INSTANT WITH SOMETHING FAINTLY LIKE
REPROACH UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS AS HIS CRAVAT WAS AND AS HIS COLLARS

AND ABILITIES TO STAY NOT MANY MINUTES MORE I WILL NOW
CONCLUDELEASTWAYS BEGINTO MENTION WHAT HAVE LED TO MY HAVING HAD THE
PRESENT HONOUR FOR WAS IT NOT SAID JOE WITH HIS OLD AIR OF LUCID
EXPOSITION THAT MY ONLY WISH WERE TO BE USEFUL TO YOU I SHOULD NOT

AGAINST THIS TONE

WELL SIR PURSUED JOE THIS IS HOW IT WERE I WERE AT THE BARGEMEN

NEIGHBOURING STREETS BUT HE WAS GONE




CHAPTER XXVIII


IT WAS CLEAR THAT I MUST REPAIR TO OUR TOWN NEXT DAY AND IN THE FIRST
FLOW OF MY REPENTANCE IT WAS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT I MUST STAY AT JOES
BUT WHEN I HAD SECURED MY BOXPLACE BY TOMORROWS COACH AND HAD BEEN
DOWN TO MR POCKETS AND BACK I WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS CONVINCED ON THE
LAST POINT AND BEGAN TO INVENT REASONS AND MAKE EXCUSES FOR PUTTING UP
AT THE BLUE BOAR I SHOULD BE AN INCONVENIENCE AT JOES I WAS NOT
EXPECTED AND MY BED WOULD NOT BE READY I SHOULD BE TOO FAR FROM MISS
HAVISHAMS AND SHE WAS EXACTING AND MIGHTNT LIKE IT ALL OTHER
SWINDLERS UPON EARTH ARE NOTHING TO THE SELFSWINDLERS AND WITH SUCH
PRETENCES DID I CHEAT MYSELF SURELY A CURIOUS THING THAT I SHOULD
INNOCENTLY TAKE A BAD HALFCROWN OF SOMEBODY ELSES MANUFACTURE IS
REASONABLE ENOUGH BUT THAT I SHOULD KNOWINGLY RECKON THE SPURIOUS COIN
OF MY OWN MAKE AS GOOD MONEY AN OBLIGING STRANGER UNDER PRETENCE OF
COMPACTLY FOLDING UP MY BANKNOTES FOR SECURITYS SAKE ABSTRACTS THE
NOTES AND GIVES ME NUTSHELLS BUT WHAT IS HIS SLEIGHT OF HAND TO MINE
WHEN I FOLD UP MY OWN NUTSHELLS AND PASS THEM ON MYSELF AS NOTES

HAVING SETTLED THAT I MUST GO TO THE BLUE BOAR MY MIND WAS MUCH
DISTURBED BY INDECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO TAKE THE AVENGER IT WAS
TEMPTING TO THINK OF THAT EXPENSIVE MERCENARY PUBLICLY AIRING HIS BOOTS
IN THE ARCHWAY OF THE BLUE BOARS POSTINGYARD IT WAS ALMOST SOLEMN TO
IMAGINE HIM CASUALLY PRODUCED IN THE TAILORS SHOP AND CONFOUNDING THE
DISRESPECTFUL SENSES OF TRABBS BOY ON THE OTHER HAND TRABBS BOY
MIGHT WORM HIMSELF INTO HIS INTIMACY AND TELL HIM THINGS OR RECKLESS
AND DESPERATE WRETCH AS I KNEW HE COULD BE MIGHT HOOT HIM IN THE HIGH
STREET MY PATRONESS TOO MIGHT HEAR OF HIM AND NOT APPROVE ON THE
WHOLE I RESOLVED TO LEAVE THE AVENGER BEHIND

IT WAS THE AFTERNOON COACH BY WHICH I HAD TAKEN MY PLACE AND AS
WINTER HAD NOW COME ROUND I SHOULD NOT ARRIVE AT MY DESTINATION UNTIL
TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER DARK OUR TIME OF STARTING FROM THE CROSS KEYS
WAS TWO OCLOCK I ARRIVED ON THE GROUND WITH A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO
SPARE ATTENDED BY THE AVENGERIF I MAY CONNECT THAT EXPRESSION WITH
ONE WHO NEVER ATTENDED ON ME IF HE COULD POSSIBLY HELP IT

AT THAT TIME IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO CARRY CONVICTS DOWN TO THE DOCKYARDS
BY STAGECOACH AS I HAD OFTEN HEARD OF THEM IN THE CAPACITY OF OUTSIDE
PASSENGERS AND HAD MORE THAN ONCE SEEN THEM ON THE HIGH ROAD DANGLING
THEIR IRONED LEGS OVER THE COACH ROOF I HAD NO CAUSE TO BE SURPRISED
WHEN HERBERT MEETING ME IN THE YARD CAME UP AND TOLD ME THERE WERE
TWO CONVICTS GOING DOWN WITH ME BUT I HAD A REASON THAT WAS AN OLD
REASON NOW FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY FALTERING WHENEVER I HEARD THE WORD
CONVICT

YOU DONT MIND THEM HANDEL SAID HERBERT

O NO

I THOUGHT YOU SEEMED AS IF YOU DIDNT LIKE THEM

I CANT PRETEND THAT I DO LIKE THEM AND I SUPPOSE YOU DONT
PARTICULARLY BUT I DONT MIND THEM

SEE THERE THEY ARE SAID HERBERT COMING OUT OF THE TAP WHAT A
DEGRADED AND VILE SIGHT IT IS

THEY HAD BEEN TREATING THEIR GUARD I SUPPOSE FOR THEY HAD A GAOLER
WITH THEM AND ALL THREE CAME OUT WIPING THEIR MOUTHS ON THEIR HANDS
THE TWO CONVICTS WERE HANDCUFFED TOGETHER AND HAD IRONS ON THEIR
LEGSIRONS OF A PATTERN THAT I KNEW WELL THEY WORE THE DRESS THAT I
LIKEWISE KNEW WELL THEIR KEEPER HAD A BRACE OF PISTOLS AND CARRIED A
THICKKNOBBED BLUDGEON UNDER HIS ARM BUT HE WAS ON TERMS OF GOOD
UNDERSTANDING WITH THEM AND STOOD WITH THEM BESIDE HIM LOOKING ON AT
THE PUTTINGTO OF THE HORSES RATHER WITH AN AIR AS IF THE CONVICTS
WERE AN INTERESTING EXHIBITION NOT FORMALLY OPEN AT THE MOMENT AND HE
THE CURATOR ONE WAS A TALLER AND STOUTER MAN THAN THE OTHER AND
APPEARED AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACCORDING TO THE MYSTERIOUS WAYS OF THE
WORLD BOTH CONVICT AND FREE TO HAVE HAD ALLOTTED TO HIM THE SMALLER
SUIT OF CLOTHES HIS ARMS AND LEGS WERE LIKE GREAT PINCUSHIONS OF THOSE
SHAPES AND HIS ATTIRE DISGUISED HIM ABSURDLY BUT I KNEW HIS
HALFCLOSED EYE AT ONE GLANCE THERE STOOD THE MAN WHOM I HAD SEEN ON
THE SETTLE AT THE THREE JOLLY BARGEMEN ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AND WHO HAD
BROUGHT ME DOWN WITH HIS INVISIBLE GUN

IT WAS EASY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS YET HE KNEW ME NO MORE THAN IF HE HAD
NEVER SEEN ME IN HIS LIFE HE LOOKED ACROSS AT ME AND HIS EYE
APPRAISED MY WATCHCHAIN AND THEN HE INCIDENTALLY SPAT AND SAID
SOMETHING TO THE OTHER CONVICT AND THEY LAUGHED AND SLUED THEMSELVES
ROUND WITH A CLINK OF THEIR COUPLING MANACLE AND LOOKED AT SOMETHING
ELSE THE GREAT NUMBERS ON THEIR BACKS AS IF THEY WERE STREET DOORS
THEIR COARSE MANGY UNGAINLY OUTER SURFACE AS IF THEY WERE LOWER
ANIMALS THEIR IRONED LEGS APOLOGETICALLY GARLANDED WITH
POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS AND THE WAY IN WHICH ALL PRESENT LOOKED AT THEM
AND KEPT FROM THEM MADE THEM AS HERBERT HAD SAID A MOST DISAGREEABLE
AND DEGRADED SPECTACLE

BUT THIS WAS NOT THE WORST OF IT IT CAME OUT THAT THE WHOLE OF THE
BACK OF THE COACH HAD BEEN TAKEN BY A FAMILY REMOVING FROM LONDON AND
THAT THERE WERE NO PLACES FOR THE TWO PRISONERS BUT ON THE SEAT IN
FRONT BEHIND THE COACHMAN HEREUPON A CHOLERIC GENTLEMAN WHO HAD
TAKEN THE FOURTH PLACE ON THAT SEAT FLEW INTO A MOST VIOLENT PASSION
AND SAID THAT IT WAS A BREACH OF CONTRACT TO MIX HIM UP WITH SUCH
VILLAINOUS COMPANY AND THAT IT WAS POISONOUS AND PERNICIOUS AND
INFAMOUS AND SHAMEFUL AND I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE AT THIS TIME THE
COACH WAS READY AND THE COACHMAN IMPATIENT AND WE WERE ALL PREPARING
TO GET UP AND THE PRISONERS HAD COME OVER WITH THEIR KEEPERBRINGING
WITH THEM THAT CURIOUS FLAVOUR OF BREADPOULTICE BAIZE ROPEYARN AND
HEARTHSTONE WHICH ATTENDS THE CONVICT PRESENCE

DONT TAKE IT SO MUCH AMISS SIR PLEADED THE KEEPER TO THE ANGRY
PASSENGER ILL SIT NEXT YOU MYSELF ILL PUT EM ON THE OUTSIDE OF
THE ROW THEY WONT INTERFERE WITH YOU SIR YOU NEEDNT KNOW THEYRE
THERE

AND DONT BLAME ME GROWLED THE CONVICT I HAD RECOGNISED I
DONT WANT TO GO I AM QUITE READY TO STAY BEHIND AS FUR AS I AM
CONCERNED ANY ONES WELCOME TO MY PLACE

OR MINE SAID THE OTHER GRUFFLY I WOULDNT HAVE INCOMMODED NONE
OF YOU IF ID HAD MY WAY THEN THEY BOTH LAUGHED AND BEGAN
CRACKING NUTS AND SPITTING THE SHELLS ABOUTAS I REALLY THINK I
SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO DO MYSELF IF I HAD BEEN IN THEIR PLACE AND SO
DESPISED

AT LENGTH IT WAS VOTED THAT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR THE ANGRY GENTLEMAN
AND THAT HE MUST EITHER GO IN HIS CHANCE COMPANY OR REMAIN BEHIND SO
HE GOT INTO HIS PLACE STILL MAKING COMPLAINTS AND THE KEEPER GOT INTO
THE PLACE NEXT HIM AND THE CONVICTS HAULED THEMSELVES UP AS WELL AS
THEY COULD AND THE CONVICT I HAD RECOGNISED SAT BEHIND ME WITH HIS
BREATH ON THE HAIR OF MY HEAD

GOODBYE HANDEL HERBERT CALLED OUT AS WE STARTED I THOUGHT WHAT A
BLESSED FORTUNE IT WAS THAT HE HAD FOUND ANOTHER NAME FOR ME THAN PIP

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS WITH WHAT ACUTENESS I FELT THE CONVICTS
BREATHING NOT ONLY ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD BUT ALL ALONG MY SPINE THE
SENSATION WAS LIKE BEING TOUCHED IN THE MARROW WITH SOME PUNGENT AND
SEARCHING ACID IT SET MY VERY TEETH ON EDGE HE SEEMED TO HAVE MORE
BREATHING BUSINESS TO DO THAN ANOTHER MAN AND TO MAKE MORE NOISE IN
DOING IT AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF GROWING HIGHSHOULDERED ON ONE SIDE
IN MY SHRINKING ENDEAVOURS TO FEND HIM OFF

THE WEATHER WAS MISERABLY RAW AND THE TWO CURSED THE COLD IT MADE US
ALL LETHARGIC BEFORE WE HAD GONE FAR AND WHEN WE HAD LEFT THE HALFWAY
HOUSE BEHIND WE HABITUALLY DOZED AND SHIVERED AND WERE SILENT I DOZED
OFF MYSELF IN CONSIDERING THE QUESTION WHETHER I OUGHT TO RESTORE A
COUPLE OF POUNDS STERLING TO THIS CREATURE BEFORE LOSING SIGHT OF HIM
AND HOW IT COULD BEST BE DONE IN THE ACT OF DIPPING FORWARD AS IF I
WERE GOING TO BATHE AMONG THE HORSES I WOKE IN A FRIGHT AND TOOK THE
QUESTION UP AGAIN

BUT I MUST HAVE LOST IT LONGER THAN I HAD THOUGHT SINCE ALTHOUGH I
COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING IN THE DARKNESS AND THE FITFUL LIGHTS AND
SHADOWS OF OUR LAMPS I TRACED MARSH COUNTRY IN THE COLD DAMP WIND THAT
BLEW AT US COWERING FORWARD FOR WARMTH AND TO MAKE ME A SCREEN AGAINST
THE WIND THE CONVICTS WERE CLOSER TO ME THAN BEFORE THE VERY FIRST
WORDS I HEARD THEM INTERCHANGE AS I BECAME CONSCIOUS WERE THE WORDS OF
MY OWN THOUGHT TWO ONE POUND NOTES

HOW DID HE GET EM SAID THE CONVICT I HAD NEVER SEEN

HOW SHOULD I KNOW RETURNED THE OTHER HE HAD EM STOWED AWAY
SOMEHOWS GIV HIM BY FRIENDS I EXPECT

I WISH SAID THE OTHER WITH A BITTER CURSE UPON THE COLD THAT I
HAD EM HERE

TWO ONE POUND NOTES OR FRIENDS

TWO ONE POUND NOTES ID SELL ALL THE FRIENDS I EVER HAD FOR ONE AND
THINK IT A BLESSED GOOD BARGAIN WELL SO HE SAYS

SO HE SAYS RESUMED THE CONVICT I HAD RECOGNISEDIT WAS ALL SAID
AND DONE IN HALF A MINUTE BEHIND A PILE OF TIMBER IN THE
DOCKYARDYOURE AGOING TO BE DISCHARGED YES I WAS WOULD I FIND
OUT THAT BOY THAT HAD FED HIM AND KEP HIS SECRET AND GIVE HIM THEM TWO
ONE POUND NOTES YES I WOULD AND I DID

MORE FOOL YOU GROWLED THE OTHER ID HAVE SPENT EM ON A MAN IN
WITTLES AND DRINK HE MUST HAVE BEEN A GREEN ONE MEAN TO SAY HE KNOWED
NOTHING OF YOU

NOT A HAPORTH DIFFERENT GANGS AND DIFFERENT SHIPS HE WAS TRIED
AGAIN FOR PRISON BREAKING AND GOT MADE A LIFER

AND WAS THATHONOURTHE ONLY TIME YOU WORKED OUT IN THIS PART OF THE
COUNTRY

THE ONLY TIME

WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOUR OPINION OF THE PLACE

A MOST BEASTLY PLACE MUDBANK MIST SWAMP AND WORK WORK SWAMP
MIST AND MUDBANK

THEY BOTH EXECRATED THE PLACE IN VERY STRONG LANGUAGE AND GRADUALLY
GROWLED THEMSELVES OUT AND HAD NOTHING LEFT TO SAY

AFTER OVERHEARING THIS DIALOGUE I SHOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE GOT DOWN AND
BEEN LEFT IN THE SOLITUDE AND DARKNESS OF THE HIGHWAY BUT FOR FEELING
CERTAIN THAT THE MAN HAD NO SUSPICION OF MY IDENTITY INDEED I WAS NOT
ONLY SO CHANGED IN THE COURSE OF NATURE BUT SO DIFFERENTLY DRESSED AND
SO DIFFERENTLY CIRCUMSTANCED THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY HE COULD
HAVE KNOWN ME WITHOUT ACCIDENTAL HELP STILL THE COINCIDENCE OF OUR
BEING TOGETHER ON THE COACH WAS SUFFICIENTLY STRANGE TO FILL ME WITH A
DREAD THAT SOME OTHER COINCIDENCE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT CONNECT ME IN
HIS HEARING WITH MY NAME FOR THIS REASON I RESOLVED TO ALIGHT AS
SOON AS WE TOUCHED THE TOWN AND PUT MYSELF OUT OF HIS HEARING THIS
DEVICE I EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY MY LITTLE PORTMANTEAU WAS IN THE BOOT
UNDER MY FEET I HAD BUT TO TURN A HINGE TO GET IT OUT I THREW IT DOWN
BEFORE ME GOT DOWN AFTER IT AND WAS LEFT AT THE FIRST LAMP ON THE
FIRST STONES OF THE TOWN PAVEMENT AS TO THE CONVICTS THEY WENT THEIR
WAY WITH THE COACH AND I KNEW AT WHAT POINT THEY WOULD BE SPIRITED OFF
TO THE RIVER IN MY FANCY I SAW THE BOAT WITH ITS CONVICT CREW WAITING
FOR THEM AT THE SLIMEWASHED STAIRSAGAIN HEARD THE GRUFF GIVE WAY
YOU LIKE AND ORDER TO DOGSAGAIN SAW THE WICKED NOAHS ARK LYING OUT
ON THE BLACK WATER

I COULD NOT HAVE SAID WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF FOR MY FEAR WAS ALTOGETHER
UNDEFINED AND VAGUE BUT THERE WAS GREAT FEAR UPON ME AS I WALKED ON
TO THE HOTEL I FELT THAT A DREAD MUCH EXCEEDING THE MERE APPREHENSION
OF A PAINFUL OR DISAGREEABLE RECOGNITION MADE ME TREMBLE I AM
CONFIDENT THAT IT TOOK NO DISTINCTNESS OF SHAPE AND THAT IT WAS THE
REVIVAL FOR A FEW MINUTES OF THE TERROR OF CHILDHOOD

THE COFFEEROOM AT THE BLUE BOAR WAS EMPTY AND I HAD NOT ONLY ORDERED
MY DINNER THERE BUT HAD SAT DOWN TO IT BEFORE THE WAITER KNEW ME AS
SOON AS HE HAD APOLOGISED FOR THE REMISSNESS OF HIS MEMORY HE ASKED ME
IF HE SHOULD SEND BOOTS FOR MR PUMBLECHOOK

NO SAID I CERTAINLY NOT

THE WAITER IT WAS HE WHO HAD BROUGHT UP THE GREAT REMONSTRANCE FROM
THE COMMERCIALS ON THE DAY WHEN I WAS BOUND APPEARED SURPRISED AND
TOOK THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING A DIRTY OLD COPY OF A LOCAL
NEWSPAPER SO DIRECTLY IN MY WAY THAT I TOOK IT UP AND READ THIS
PARAGRAPH

OUR READERS WILL LEARN NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT INTEREST IN REFERENCE
TO THE RECENT ROMANTIC RISE IN FORTUNE OF A YOUNG ARTIFICER IN IRON OF
THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD WHAT A THEME BY THE WAY FOR THE MAGIC PEN OF OUR
AS YET NOT UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TOWNSMAN TOOBY THE POET OF OUR
COLUMNS THAT THE YOUTHS EARLIEST PATRON COMPANION AND FRIEND WAS
A HIGHLY RESPECTED INDIVIDUAL NOT ENTIRELY UNCONNECTED WITH THE CORN
AND SEED TRADE AND WHOSE EMINENTLY CONVENIENT AND COMMODIOUS BUSINESS
PREMISES ARE SITUATE WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF THE HIGH STREET IT IS
NOT WHOLLY IRRESPECTIVE OF OUR PERSONAL FEELINGS THAT WE RECORD HIM AS
THE MENTOR OF OUR YOUNG TELEMACHUS FOR IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT OUR
TOWN PRODUCED THE FOUNDER OF THE LATTERS FORTUNES DOES THE
THOUGHTCONTRACTED BROW OF THE LOCAL SAGE OR THE LUSTROUS EYE OF LOCAL
BEAUTY INQUIRE WHOSE FORTUNES WE BELIEVE THAT QUINTIN MATSYS WAS THE
BLACKSMITH OF ANTWERP VERB SAP

I ENTERTAIN A CONVICTION BASED UPON LARGE EXPERIENCE THAT IF IN THE
DAYS OF MY PROSPERITY I HAD GONE TO THE NORTH POLE I SHOULD HAVE MET
SOMEBODY THERE WANDERING ESQUIMAUX OR CIVILIZED MAN WHO WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT PUMBLECHOOK WAS MY EARLIEST PATRON AND THE FOUNDER OF MY
FORTUNES




CHAPTER XXIX


BETIMES IN THE MORNING I WAS UP AND OUT IT WAS TOO EARLY YET TO GO TO
MISS HAVISHAMS SO I LOITERED INTO THE COUNTRY ON MISS HAVISHAMS SIDE
OF TOWNWHICH WAS NOT JOES SIDE I COULD GO THERE TOMORROWTHINKING
ABOUT MY PATRONESS AND PAINTING BRILLIANT PICTURES OF HER PLANS FOR
ME

SHE HAD ADOPTED ESTELLA SHE HAD AS GOOD AS ADOPTED ME AND IT COULD
NOT FAIL TO BE HER INTENTION TO BRING US TOGETHER SHE RESERVED IT FOR
ME TO RESTORE THE DESOLATE HOUSE ADMIT THE SUNSHINE INTO THE DARK
ROOMS SET THE CLOCKS AGOING AND THE COLD HEARTHS ABLAZING TEAR DOWN
THE COBWEBS DESTROY THE VERMININ SHORT DO ALL THE SHINING DEEDS OF
THE YOUNG KNIGHT OF ROMANCE AND MARRY THE PRINCESS I HAD STOPPED TO
LOOK AT THE HOUSE AS I PASSED AND ITS SEARED RED BRICK WALLS BLOCKED
WINDOWS AND STRONG GREEN IVY CLASPING EVEN THE STACKS OF CHIMNEYS WITH
ITS TWIGS AND TENDONS AS IF WITH SINEWY OLD ARMS HAD MADE UP A RICH
ATTRACTIVE MYSTERY OF WHICH I WAS THE HERO ESTELLA WAS THE
INSPIRATION OF IT AND THE HEART OF IT OF COURSE BUT THOUGH SHE HAD
TAKEN SUCH STRONG POSSESSION OF ME THOUGH MY FANCY AND MY HOPE WERE SO
SET UPON HER THOUGH HER INFLUENCE ON MY BOYISH LIFE AND CHARACTER HAD
BEEN ALLPOWERFUL I DID NOT EVEN THAT ROMANTIC MORNING INVEST HER
WITH ANY ATTRIBUTES SAVE THOSE SHE POSSESSED I MENTION THIS IN THIS
PLACE OF A FIXED PURPOSE BECAUSE IT IS THE CLUE BY WHICH I AM TO BE
FOLLOWED INTO MY POOR LABYRINTH ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE THE
CONVENTIONAL NOTION OF A LOVER CANNOT BE ALWAYS TRUE THE UNQUALIFIED
TRUTH IS THAT WHEN I LOVED ESTELLA WITH THE LOVE OF A MAN I LOVED HER
SIMPLY BECAUSE I FOUND HER IRRESISTIBLE ONCE FOR ALL I KNEW TO MY
SORROW OFTEN AND OFTEN IF NOT ALWAYS THAT I LOVED HER AGAINST
REASON AGAINST PROMISE AGAINST PEACE AGAINST HOPE AGAINST
HAPPINESS AGAINST ALL DISCOURAGEMENT THAT COULD BE ONCE FOR ALL I
LOVED HER NONE THE LESS BECAUSE I KNEW IT AND IT HAD NO MORE INFLUENCE
IN RESTRAINING ME THAN IF I HAD DEVOUTLY BELIEVED HER TO BE HUMAN
PERFECTION

I SO SHAPED OUT MY WALK AS TO ARRIVE AT THE GATE AT MY OLD TIME WHEN I
HAD RUNG AT THE BELL WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND I TURNED MY BACK UPON THE
GATE WHILE I TRIED TO GET MY BREATH AND KEEP THE BEATING OF MY HEART
MODERATELY QUIET I HEARD THE SIDEDOOR OPEN AND STEPS COME ACROSS THE
COURTYARD BUT I PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR EVEN WHEN THE GATE SWUNG ON ITS
RUSTY HINGES

BEING AT LAST TOUCHED ON THE SHOULDER I STARTED AND TURNED I STARTED
MUCH MORE NATURALLY THEN TO FIND MYSELF CONFRONTED BY A MAN IN A SOBER
GREY DRESS THE LAST MAN I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE IN THAT PLACE OF
PORTER AT MISS HAVISHAMS DOOR

ORLICK

AH YOUNG MASTER THERES MORE CHANGES THAN YOURS BUT COME IN COME
IN ITS OPPOSED TO MY ORDERS TO HOLD THE GATE OPEN

I ENTERED AND HE SWUNG IT AND LOCKED IT AND TOOK THE KEY OUT YES
SAID HE FACING ROUND AFTER DOGGEDLY PRECEDING ME A FEW STEPS TOWARDS
THE HOUSE HERE I AM

HOW DID YOU COME HERE

I COME HERE HE RETORTED ON MY LEGS I HAD MY BOX BROUGHT ALONGSIDE
ME IN A BARROW

ARE YOU HERE FOR GOOD

I AINT HERE FOR HARM YOUNG MASTER I SUPPOSE

I WAS NOT SO SURE OF THAT I HAD LEISURE TO ENTERTAIN THE RETORT IN MY
MIND WHILE HE SLOWLY LIFTED HIS HEAVY GLANCE FROM THE PAVEMENT UP MY
LEGS AND ARMS TO MY FACE

THEN YOU HAVE LEFT THE FORGE I SAID

DO THIS LOOK LIKE A FORGE REPLIED ORLICK SENDING HIS GLANCE ALL
ROUND HIM WITH AN AIR OF INJURY NOW DO IT LOOK LIKE IT

I ASKED HIM HOW LONG HE HAD LEFT GARGERYS FORGE

ONE DAY IS SO LIKE ANOTHER HERE HE REPLIED THAT I DONT KNOW
WITHOUT CASTING IT UP HOWEVER I COME HERE SOME TIME SINCE YOU LEFT

I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT ORLICK

AH SAID HE DRYLY BUT THEN YOUVE GOT TO BE A SCHOLAR

BY THIS TIME WE HAD COME TO THE HOUSE WHERE I FOUND HIS ROOM TO BE ONE
JUST WITHIN THE SIDEDOOR WITH A LITTLE WINDOW IN IT LOOKING ON THE
COURTYARD IN ITS SMALL PROPORTIONS IT WAS NOT UNLIKE THE KIND OF
PLACE USUALLY ASSIGNED TO A GATEPORTER IN PARIS CERTAIN KEYS WERE
HANGING ON THE WALL TO WHICH HE NOW ADDED THE GATE KEY AND HIS
PATCHWORKCOVERED BED WAS IN A LITTLE INNER DIVISION OR RECESS THE
WHOLE HAD A SLOVENLY CONFINED AND SLEEPY LOOK LIKE A CAGE FOR A
HUMAN DORMOUSE WHILE HE LOOMING DARK AND HEAVY IN THE SHADOW OF A
CORNER BY THE WINDOW LOOKED LIKE THE HUMAN DORMOUSE FOR WHOM IT WAS
FITTED UPAS INDEED HE WAS

I NEVER SAW THIS ROOM BEFORE I REMARKED BUT THERE USED TO BE NO
PORTER HERE

NO SAID HE NOT TILL IT GOT ABOUT THAT THERE WAS NO PROTECTION ON
THE PREMISES AND IT COME TO BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS WITH CONVICTS AND
TAG AND RAG AND BOBTAIL GOING UP AND DOWN AND THEN I WAS RECOMMENDED
TO THE PLACE AS A MAN WHO COULD GIVE ANOTHER MAN AS GOOD AS HE BROUGHT
AND I TOOK IT ITS EASIER THAN BELLOWSING AND HAMMERINGTHATS
LOADED THAT IS

MY EYE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A GUN WITH A BRASSBOUND STOCK OVER THE
CHIMNEYPIECE AND HIS EYE HAD FOLLOWED MINE

WELL SAID I NOT DESIROUS OF MORE CONVERSATION SHALL I GO UP TO
MISS HAVISHAM

BURN ME IF I KNOW HE RETORTED FIRST STRETCHING HIMSELF AND THEN
SHAKING HIMSELF MY ORDERS ENDS HERE YOUNG MASTER I GIVE THIS HERE
BELL A RAP WITH THIS HERE HAMMER AND YOU GO ON ALONG THE PASSAGE TILL
YOU MEET SOMEBODY

I AM EXPECTED I BELIEVE

BURN ME TWICE OVER IF I CAN SAY SAID HE

UPON THAT I TURNED DOWN THE LONG PASSAGE WHICH I HAD FIRST TRODDEN IN
MY THICK BOOTS AND HE MADE HIS BELL SOUND AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE
WHILE THE BELL WAS STILL REVERBERATING I FOUND SARAH POCKET WHO
APPEARED TO HAVE NOW BECOME CONSTITUTIONALLY GREEN AND YELLOW BY REASON
OF ME

OH SAID SHE YOU IS IT MR PIP

IT IS MISS POCKET I AM GLAD TO TELL YOU THAT MR POCKET AND FAMILY
ARE ALL WELL

ARE THEY ANY WISER SAID SARAH WITH A DISMAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD
THEY HAD BETTER BE WISER THAN WELL AH MATTHEW MATTHEW YOU KNOW
YOUR WAY SIR

TOLERABLY FOR I HAD GONE UP THE STAIRCASE IN THE DARK MANY A TIME I
ASCENDED IT NOW IN LIGHTER BOOTS THAN OF YORE AND TAPPED IN MY OLD
WAY AT THE DOOR OF MISS HAVISHAMS ROOM PIPS RAP I HEARD HER SAY
IMMEDIATELY COME IN PIP

SHE WAS IN HER CHAIR NEAR THE OLD TABLE IN THE OLD DRESS WITH HER TWO
HANDS CROSSED ON HER STICK HER CHIN RESTING ON THEM AND HER EYES ON
THE FIRE SITTING NEAR HER WITH THE WHITE SHOE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN
WORN IN HER HAND AND HER HEAD BENT AS SHE LOOKED AT IT WAS AN
ELEGANT LADY WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN

COME IN PIP MISS HAVISHAM CONTINUED TO MUTTER WITHOUT LOOKING
ROUND OR UP COME IN PIP HOW DO YOU DO PIP SO YOU KISS MY HAND AS
IF I WERE A QUEEN EHWELL

SHE LOOKED UP AT ME SUDDENLY ONLY MOVING HER EYES AND REPEATED IN A
GRIMLY PLAYFUL MANNER

WELL

I HEARD MISS HAVISHAM SAID I RATHER AT A LOSS THAT YOU WERE SO
KIND AS TO WISH ME TO COME AND SEE YOU AND I CAME DIRECTLY

WELL

THE LADY WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND LOOKED
ARCHLY AT ME AND THEN I SAW THAT THE EYES WERE ESTELLAS EYES BUT SHE
WAS SO MUCH CHANGED WAS SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL SO MUCH MORE WOMANLY
IN ALL THINGS WINNING ADMIRATION HAD MADE SUCH WONDERFUL ADVANCE THAT
I SEEMED TO HAVE MADE NONE I FANCIED AS I LOOKED AT HER THAT I
SLIPPED HOPELESSLY BACK INTO THE COARSE AND COMMON BOY AGAIN O THE
SENSE OF DISTANCE AND DISPARITY THAT CAME UPON ME AND THE
INACCESSIBILITY THAT CAME ABOUT HER

SHE GAVE ME HER HAND I STAMMERED SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLEASURE I FELT
IN SEEING HER AGAIN AND ABOUT MY HAVING LOOKED FORWARD TO IT FOR A
LONG LONG TIME

DO YOU FIND HER MUCH CHANGED PIP ASKED MISS HAVISHAM WITH HER
GREEDY LOOK AND STRIKING HER STICK UPON A CHAIR THAT STOOD BETWEEN
THEM AS A SIGN TO ME TO SIT DOWN THERE

WHEN I CAME IN MISS HAVISHAM I THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING OF ESTELLA
IN THE FACE OR FIGURE BUT NOW IT ALL SETTLES DOWN SO CURIOUSLY INTO
THE OLD

WHAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SAY INTO THE OLD ESTELLA MISS HAVISHAM
INTERRUPTED SHE WAS PROUD AND INSULTING AND YOU WANTED TO GO AWAY
FROM HER DONT YOU REMEMBER

I SAID CONFUSEDLY THAT THAT WAS LONG AGO AND THAT I KNEW NO BETTER
THEN AND THE LIKE ESTELLA SMILED WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE AND SAID SHE
HAD NO DOUBT OF MY HAVING BEEN QUITE RIGHT AND OF HER HAVING BEEN VERY
DISAGREEABLE

IS HE CHANGED MISS HAVISHAM ASKED HER

VERY MUCH SAID ESTELLA LOOKING AT ME

LESS COARSE AND COMMON SAID MISS HAVISHAM PLAYING WITH ESTELLAS
HAIR

ESTELLA LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT THE SHOE IN HER HAND AND LAUGHED AGAIN
AND LOOKED AT ME AND PUT THE SHOE DOWN SHE TREATED ME AS A BOY STILL
BUT SHE LURED ME ON

WE SAT IN THE DREAMY ROOM AMONG THE OLD STRANGE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD SO
WROUGHT UPON ME AND I LEARNT THAT SHE HAD BUT JUST COME HOME FROM
FRANCE AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LONDON PROUD AND WILFUL AS OF OLD
SHE HAD BROUGHT THOSE QUALITIES INTO SUCH SUBJECTION TO HER BEAUTY THAT
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND OUT OF NATUREOR I THOUGHT SOTO SEPARATE THEM
FROM HER BEAUTY TRULY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISSOCIATE HER PRESENCE
FROM ALL THOSE WRETCHED HANKERINGS AFTER MONEY AND GENTILITY THAT HAD
DISTURBED MY BOYHOODFROM ALL THOSE ILLREGULATED ASPIRATIONS THAT HAD
FIRST MADE ME ASHAMED OF HOME AND JOEFROM ALL THOSE VISIONS THAT HAD
RAISED HER FACE IN THE GLOWING FIRE STRUCK IT OUT OF THE IRON ON THE
ANVIL EXTRACTED IT FROM THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT TO LOOK IN AT THE WOODEN
WINDOW OF THE FORGE AND FLIT AWAY IN A WORD IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO SEPARATE HER IN THE PAST OR IN THE PRESENT FROM THE INNERMOST LIFE
OF MY LIFE

IT WAS SETTLED THAT I SHOULD STAY THERE ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND
RETURN TO THE HOTEL AT NIGHT AND TO LONDON TOMORROW WHEN WE HAD
CONVERSED FOR A WHILE MISS HAVISHAM SENT US TWO OUT TO WALK IN THE
NEGLECTED GARDEN ON OUR COMING IN BY AND BY SHE SAID I SHOULD WHEEL
HER ABOUT A LITTLE AS IN TIMES OF YORE

SO ESTELLA AND I WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN BY THE GATE THROUGH WHICH I
HAD STRAYED TO MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN NOW HERBERT
I TREMBLING IN SPIRIT AND WORSHIPPING THE VERY HEM OF HER DRESS SHE
QUITE COMPOSED AND MOST DECIDEDLY NOT WORSHIPPING THE HEM OF MINE AS
WE DREW NEAR TO THE PLACE OF ENCOUNTER SHE STOPPED AND SAID

I MUST HAVE BEEN A SINGULAR LITTLE CREATURE TO HIDE AND SEE THAT FIGHT
THAT DAY BUT I DID AND I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH

YOU REWARDED ME VERY MUCH

DID I SHE REPLIED IN AN INCIDENTAL AND FORGETFUL WAY I REMEMBER I
ENTERTAINED A GREAT OBJECTION TO YOUR ADVERSARY BECAUSE I TOOK IT ILL
THAT HE SHOULD BE BROUGHT HERE TO PESTER ME WITH HIS COMPANY

HE AND I ARE GREAT FRIENDS NOW

ARE YOU I THINK I RECOLLECT THOUGH THAT YOU READ WITH HIS FATHER

YES

I MADE THE ADMISSION WITH RELUCTANCE FOR IT SEEMED TO HAVE A BOYISH
LOOK AND SHE ALREADY TREATED ME MORE THAN ENOUGH LIKE A BOY

SINCE YOUR CHANGE OF FORTUNE AND PROSPECTS YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR
COMPANIONS SAID ESTELLA

NATURALLY SAID I

AND NECESSARILY SHE ADDED IN A HAUGHTY TONE WHAT WAS FIT COMPANY
FOR YOU ONCE WOULD BE QUITE UNFIT COMPANY FOR YOU NOW

IN MY CONSCIENCE I DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER I HAD ANY LINGERING
INTENTION LEFT OF GOING TO SEE JOE BUT IF I HAD THIS OBSERVATION PUT
IT TO FLIGHT

YOU HAD NO IDEA OF YOUR IMPENDING GOOD FORTUNE IN THOSE TIMES SAID
ESTELLA WITH A SLIGHT WAVE OF HER HAND SIGNIFYING IN THE FIGHTING
TIMES

NOT THE LEAST

THE AIR OF COMPLETENESS AND SUPERIORITY WITH WHICH SHE WALKED AT MY
SIDE AND THE AIR OF YOUTHFULNESS AND SUBMISSION WITH WHICH I WALKED AT
HERS MADE A CONTRAST THAT I STRONGLY FELT IT WOULD HAVE RANKLED IN ME
MORE THAN IT DID IF I HAD NOT REGARDED MYSELF AS ELICITING IT BY BEING
SO SET APART FOR HER AND ASSIGNED TO HER

THE GARDEN WAS TOO OVERGROWN AND RANK FOR WALKING IN WITH EASE AND
AFTER WE HAD MADE THE ROUND OF IT TWICE OR THRICE WE CAME OUT AGAIN
INTO THE BREWERY YARD I SHOWED HER TO A NICETY WHERE I HAD SEEN HER
WALKING ON THE CASKS THAT FIRST OLD DAY AND SHE SAID WITH A COLD AND
CARELESS LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION DID I I REMINDED HER WHERE SHE HAD
COME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GIVEN ME MY MEAT AND DRINK AND SHE SAID I
DONT REMEMBER NOT REMEMBER THAT YOU MADE ME CRY SAID I NO
SAID SHE AND SHOOK HER HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT HER I VERILY BELIEVE
THAT HER NOT REMEMBERING AND NOT MINDING IN THE LEAST MADE ME CRY
AGAIN INWARDLYAND THAT IS THE SHARPEST CRYING OF ALL

YOU MUST KNOW SAID ESTELLA CONDESCENDING TO ME AS A BRILLIANT AND
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN MIGHT THAT I HAVE NO HEARTIF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO
DO WITH MY MEMORY

I GOT THROUGH SOME JARGON TO THE EFFECT THAT I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF
DOUBTING THAT THAT I KNEW BETTER THAT THERE COULD BE NO SUCH BEAUTY
WITHOUT IT

OH I HAVE A HEART TO BE STABBED IN OR SHOT IN I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID
ESTELLA AND OF COURSE IF IT CEASED TO BEAT I SHOULD CEASE TO BE BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I HAVE NO SOFTNESS THERE
NOSYMPATHYSENTIMENTNONSENSE

WHAT WAS IT THAT WAS BORNE IN UPON MY MIND WHEN SHE STOOD STILL AND
LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT ME ANYTHING THAT I HAD SEEN IN MISS HAVISHAM
NO IN SOME OF HER LOOKS AND GESTURES THERE WAS THAT TINGE OF
RESEMBLANCE TO MISS HAVISHAM WHICH MAY OFTEN BE NOTICED TO HAVE BEEN
ACQUIRED BY CHILDREN FROM GROWN PERSON WITH WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH
ASSOCIATED AND SECLUDED AND WHICH WHEN CHILDHOOD IS PASSED WILL
PRODUCE A REMARKABLE OCCASIONAL LIKENESS OF EXPRESSION BETWEEN FACES
THAT ARE OTHERWISE QUITE DIFFERENT AND YET I COULD NOT TRACE THIS TO
MISS HAVISHAM I LOOKED AGAIN AND THOUGH SHE WAS STILL LOOKING AT ME
THE SUGGESTION WAS GONE

WHAT WAS IT

I AM SERIOUS SAID ESTELLA NOT SO MUCH WITH A FROWN FOR HER BROW
WAS SMOOTH AS WITH A DARKENING OF HER FACE IF WE ARE TO BE THROWN
MUCH TOGETHER YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT AT ONCE NO IMPERIOUSLY
STOPPING ME AS I OPENED MY LIPS I HAVE NOT BESTOWED MY TENDERNESS
ANYWHERE I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY SUCH THING

IN ANOTHER MOMENT WE WERE IN THE BREWERY SO LONG DISUSED AND SHE
POINTED TO THE HIGH GALLERY WHERE I HAD SEEN HER GOING OUT ON THAT SAME
FIRST DAY AND TOLD ME SHE REMEMBERED TO HAVE BEEN UP THERE AND TO
HAVE SEEN ME STANDING SCARED BELOW AS MY EYES FOLLOWED HER WHITE HAND
AGAIN THE SAME DIM SUGGESTION THAT I COULD NOT POSSIBLY GRASP CROSSED
ME MY INVOLUNTARY START OCCASIONED HER TO LAY HER HAND UPON MY ARM
INSTANTLY THE GHOST PASSED ONCE MORE AND WAS GONE

WHAT WAS IT

WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ESTELLA ARE YOU SCARED AGAIN

I SHOULD BE IF I BELIEVED WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW I REPLIED TO TURN
IT OFF

THEN YOU DONT VERY WELL IT IS SAID AT ANY RATE MISS HAVISHAM WILL
SOON BE EXPECTING YOU AT YOUR OLD POST THOUGH I THINK THAT MIGHT BE
LAID ASIDE NOW WITH OTHER OLD BELONGINGS LET US MAKE ONE MORE ROUND
OF THE GARDEN AND THEN GO IN COME YOU SHALL NOT SHED TEARS FOR MY
CRUELTY TODAY YOU SHALL BE MY PAGE AND GIVE ME YOUR SHOULDER

HER HANDSOME DRESS HAD TRAILED UPON THE GROUND SHE HELD IT IN ONE HAND
NOW AND WITH THE OTHER LIGHTLY TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AS WE WALKED WE
WALKED ROUND THE RUINED GARDEN TWICE OR THRICE MORE AND IT WAS ALL IN
BLOOM FOR ME IF THE GREEN AND YELLOW GROWTH OF WEED IN THE CHINKS OF
THE OLD WALL HAD BEEN THE MOST PRECIOUS FLOWERS THAT EVER BLEW IT
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE CHERISHED IN MY REMEMBRANCE

THERE WAS NO DISCREPANCY OF YEARS BETWEEN US TO REMOVE HER FAR FROM ME
WE WERE OF NEARLY THE SAME AGE THOUGH OF COURSE THE AGE TOLD FOR MORE
IN HER CASE THAN IN MINE BUT THE AIR OF INACCESSIBILITY WHICH HER
BEAUTY AND HER MANNER GAVE HER TORMENTED ME IN THE MIDST OF MY
DELIGHT AND AT THE HEIGHT OF THE ASSURANCE I FELT THAT OUR PATRONESS
HAD CHOSEN US FOR ONE ANOTHER WRETCHED BOY

AT LAST WE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND THERE I HEARD WITH SURPRISE
THAT MY GUARDIAN HAD COME DOWN TO SEE MISS HAVISHAM ON BUSINESS AND
WOULD COME BACK TO DINNER THE OLD WINTRY BRANCHES OF CHANDELIERS IN
THE ROOM WHERE THE MOULDERING TABLE WAS SPREAD HAD BEEN LIGHTED WHILE
WE WERE OUT AND MISS HAVISHAM WAS IN HER CHAIR AND WAITING FOR ME

IT WAS LIKE PUSHING THE CHAIR ITSELF BACK INTO THE PAST WHEN WE BEGAN
THE OLD SLOW CIRCUIT ROUND ABOUT THE ASHES OF THE BRIDAL FEAST BUT IN
THE FUNEREAL ROOM WITH THAT FIGURE OF THE GRAVE FALLEN BACK IN THE
CHAIR FIXING ITS EYES UPON HER ESTELLA LOOKED MORE BRIGHT AND
BEAUTIFUL THAN BEFORE AND I WAS UNDER STRONGER ENCHANTMENT

THE TIME SO MELTED AWAY THAT OUR EARLY DINNERHOUR DREW CLOSE AT HAND
AND ESTELLA LEFT US TO PREPARE HERSELF WE HAD STOPPED NEAR THE CENTRE
OF THE LONG TABLE AND MISS HAVISHAM WITH ONE OF HER WITHERED ARMS
STRETCHED OUT OF THE CHAIR RESTED THAT CLENCHED HAND UPON THE YELLOW
CLOTH AS ESTELLA LOOKED BACK OVER HER SHOULDER BEFORE GOING OUT AT THE
DOOR MISS HAVISHAM KISSED THAT HAND TO HER WITH A RAVENOUS INTENSITY
THAT WAS OF ITS KIND QUITE DREADFUL

THEN ESTELLA BEING GONE AND WE TWO LEFT ALONE SHE TURNED TO ME AND
SAID IN A WHISPER

IS SHE BEAUTIFUL GRACEFUL WELLGROWN DO YOU ADMIRE HER

EVERYBODY MUST WHO SEES HER MISS HAVISHAM

SHE DREW AN ARM ROUND MY NECK AND DREW MY HEAD CLOSE DOWN TO HERS AS
SHE SAT IN THE CHAIR LOVE HER LOVE HER LOVE HER HOW DOES SHE USE
YOU

BEFORE I COULD ANSWER IF I COULD HAVE ANSWERED SO DIFFICULT A QUESTION
AT ALL SHE REPEATED LOVE HER LOVE HER LOVE HER IF SHE FAVOURS
YOU LOVE HER IF SHE WOUNDS YOU LOVE HER IF SHE TEARS YOUR HEART TO
PIECESAND AS IT GETS OLDER AND STRONGER IT WILL TEAR DEEPERLOVE
HER LOVE HER LOVE HER

NEVER HAD I SEEN SUCH PASSIONATE EAGERNESS AS WAS JOINED TO HER
UTTERANCE OF THESE WORDS I COULD FEEL THE MUSCLES OF THE THIN ARM
ROUND MY NECK SWELL WITH THE VEHEMENCE THAT POSSESSED HER

HEAR ME PIP I ADOPTED HER TO BE LOVED I BRED HER AND EDUCATED HER
TO BE LOVED I DEVELOPED HER INTO WHAT SHE IS THAT SHE MIGHT BE LOVED
LOVE HER

SHE SAID THE WORD OFTEN ENOUGH AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT SHE
MEANT TO SAY IT BUT IF THE OFTEN REPEATED WORD HAD BEEN HATE INSTEAD
OF LOVEDESPAIRREVENGEDIRE DEATHIT COULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED FROM HER
LIPS MORE LIKE A CURSE

ILL TELL YOU SAID SHE IN THE SAME HURRIED PASSIONATE WHISPER
WHAT REAL LOVE IS IT IS BLIND DEVOTION UNQUESTIONING
SELFHUMILIATION UTTER SUBMISSION TRUST AND BELIEF AGAINST YOURSELF
AND AGAINST THE WHOLE WORLD GIVING UP YOUR WHOLE HEART AND SOUL TO THE
SMITERAS I DID

WHEN SHE CAME TO THAT AND TO A WILD CRY THAT FOLLOWED THAT I CAUGHT
HER ROUND THE WAIST FOR SHE ROSE UP IN THE CHAIR IN HER SHROUD OF A
DRESS AND STRUCK AT THE AIR AS IF SHE WOULD AS SOON HAVE STRUCK
HERSELF AGAINST THE WALL AND FALLEN DEAD

ALL THIS PASSED IN A FEW SECONDS AS I DREW HER DOWN INTO HER CHAIR I
WAS CONSCIOUS OF A SCENT THAT I KNEW AND TURNING SAW MY GUARDIAN IN
THE ROOM

HE ALWAYS CARRIED I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED IT I THINK A
POCKETHANDKERCHIEF OF RICH SILK AND OF IMPOSING PROPORTIONS WHICH WAS
OF GREAT VALUE TO HIM IN HIS PROFESSION I HAVE SEEN HIM SO TERRIFY A
CLIENT OR A WITNESS BY CEREMONIOUSLY UNFOLDING THIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF
AS IF HE WERE IMMEDIATELY GOING TO BLOW HIS NOSE AND THEN PAUSING AS
IF HE KNEW HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TIME TO DO IT BEFORE SUCH CLIENT OR
WITNESS COMMITTED HIMSELF THAT THE SELFCOMMITTAL HAS FOLLOWED
DIRECTLY QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE WHEN I SAW HIM IN THE ROOM HE
HAD THIS EXPRESSIVE POCKETHANDKERCHIEF IN BOTH HANDS AND WAS LOOKING
AT US ON MEETING MY EYE HE SAID PLAINLY BY A MOMENTARY AND SILENT
PAUSE IN THAT ATTITUDE INDEED SINGULAR AND THEN PUT THE
HANDKERCHIEF TO ITS RIGHT USE WITH WONDERFUL EFFECT

MISS HAVISHAM HAD SEEN HIM AS SOON AS I AND WAS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
AFRAID OF HIM SHE MADE A STRONG ATTEMPT TO COMPOSE HERSELF AND
STAMMERED THAT HE WAS AS PUNCTUAL AS EVER

AS PUNCTUAL AS EVER HE REPEATED COMING UP TO US HOW DO YOU DO
PIP SHALL I GIVE YOU A RIDE MISS HAVISHAM ONCE ROUND AND SO YOU
ARE HERE PIP

I TOLD HIM WHEN I HAD ARRIVED AND HOW MISS HAVISHAM HAD WISHED ME TO
COME AND SEE ESTELLA TO WHICH HE REPLIED AH VERY FINE YOUNG LADY
THEN HE PUSHED MISS HAVISHAM IN HER CHAIR BEFORE HIM WITH ONE OF HIS
LARGE HANDS AND PUT THE OTHER IN HIS TROUSERSPOCKET AS IF THE POCKET
WERE FULL OF SECRETS

WELL PIP HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU SEEN MISS ESTELLA BEFORE SAID HE WHEN
HE CAME TO A STOP

HOW OFTEN

AH HOW MANY TIMES TEN THOUSAND TIMES

OH CERTAINLY NOT SO MANY

TWICE

JAGGERS INTERPOSED MISS HAVISHAM MUCH TO MY RELIEF LEAVE MY PIP
ALONE AND GO WITH HIM TO YOUR DINNER

HE COMPLIED AND WE GROPED OUR WAY DOWN THE DARK STAIRS TOGETHER WHILE
WE WERE STILL ON OUR WAY TO THOSE DETACHED APARTMENTS ACROSS THE PAVED
YARD AT THE BACK HE ASKED ME HOW OFTEN I HAD SEEN MISS HAVISHAM EAT
AND DRINK OFFERING ME A BREADTH OF CHOICE AS USUAL BETWEEN A HUNDRED
TIMES AND ONCE

I CONSIDERED AND SAID NEVER

AND NEVER WILL PIP HE RETORTED WITH A FROWNING SMILE SHE HAS
NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE SEEN DOING EITHER SINCE SHE LIVED THIS
PRESENT LIFE OF HERS SHE WANDERS ABOUT IN THE NIGHT AND THEN LAYS
HANDS ON SUCH FOOD AS SHE TAKES

PRAY SIR SAID I MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION

YOU MAY SAID HE AND I MAY DECLINE TO ANSWER IT PUT YOUR
QUESTION

ESTELLAS NAME IS IT HAVISHAM OR I HAD NOTHING TO ADD

OR WHAT SAID HE

IS IT HAVISHAM

IT IS HAVISHAM

THIS BROUGHT US TO THE DINNERTABLE WHERE SHE AND SARAH POCKET AWAITED
US MR JAGGERS PRESIDED ESTELLA SAT OPPOSITE TO HIM I FACED MY GREEN
AND YELLOW FRIEND WE DINED VERY WELL AND WERE WAITED ON BY A
MAIDSERVANT WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN IN ALL MY COMINGS AND GOINGS BUT
WHO FOR ANYTHING I KNOW HAD BEEN IN THAT MYSTERIOUS HOUSE THE WHOLE
TIME AFTER DINNER A BOTTLE OF CHOICE OLD PORT WAS PLACED BEFORE MY
GUARDIAN HE WAS EVIDENTLY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE VINTAGE AND THE
TWO LADIES LEFT US

ANYTHING TO EQUAL THE DETERMINED RETICENCE OF MR JAGGERS UNDER THAT
ROOF I NEVER SAW ELSEWHERE EVEN IN HIM HE KEPT HIS VERY LOOKS TO
HIMSELF AND SCARCELY DIRECTED HIS EYES TO ESTELLAS FACE ONCE DURING
DINNER WHEN SHE SPOKE TO HIM HE LISTENED AND IN DUE COURSE ANSWERED
BUT NEVER LOOKED AT HER THAT I COULD SEE ON THE OTHER HAND SHE OFTEN
LOOKED AT HIM WITH INTEREST AND CURIOSITY IF NOT DISTRUST BUT HIS
FACE NEVER SHOWED THE LEAST CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGHOUT DINNER HE TOOK A
DRY DELIGHT IN MAKING SARAH POCKET GREENER AND YELLOWER BY OFTEN
REFERRING IN CONVERSATION WITH ME TO MY EXPECTATIONS BUT HERE AGAIN
HE SHOWED NO CONSCIOUSNESS AND EVEN MADE IT APPEAR THAT HE
EXTORTEDAND EVEN DID EXTORT THOUGH I DONT KNOW HOWTHOSE REFERENCES
OUT OF MY INNOCENT SELF

AND WHEN HE AND I WERE LEFT ALONE TOGETHER HE SAT WITH AN AIR UPON HIM
OF GENERAL LYING BY IN CONSEQUENCE OF INFORMATION HE POSSESSED THAT
REALLY WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME HE CROSSEXAMINED HIS VERY WINE WHEN HE HAD
NOTHING ELSE IN HAND HE HELD IT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE CANDLE TASTED
THE PORT ROLLED IT IN HIS MOUTH SWALLOWED IT LOOKED AT HIS GLASS
AGAIN SMELT THE PORT TRIED IT DRANK IT FILLED AGAIN AND
CROSSEXAMINED THE GLASS AGAIN UNTIL I WAS AS NERVOUS AS IF I HAD
KNOWN THE WINE TO BE TELLING HIM SOMETHING TO MY DISADVANTAGE THREE OR
FOUR TIMES I FEEBLY THOUGHT I WOULD START CONVERSATION BUT WHENEVER HE
SAW ME GOING TO ASK HIM ANYTHING HE LOOKED AT ME WITH HIS GLASS IN HIS
HAND AND ROLLING HIS WINE ABOUT IN HIS MOUTH AS IF REQUESTING ME TO
TAKE NOTICE THAT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE COULDNT ANSWER

I THINK MISS POCKET WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THE SIGHT OF ME INVOLVED HER IN
THE DANGER OF BEING GOADED TO MADNESS AND PERHAPS TEARING OFF HER
CAPWHICH WAS A VERY HIDEOUS ONE IN THE NATURE OF A MUSLIN MOPAND
STREWING THE GROUND WITH HER HAIRWHICH ASSUREDLY HAD NEVER GROWN ON
HER HEAD SHE DID NOT APPEAR WHEN WE AFTERWARDS WENT UP TO MISS
HAVISHAMS ROOM AND WE FOUR PLAYED AT WHIST IN THE INTERVAL MISS
HAVISHAM IN A FANTASTIC WAY HAD PUT SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWELS
FROM HER DRESSINGTABLE INTO ESTELLAS HAIR AND ABOUT HER BOSOM AND
ARMS AND I SAW EVEN MY GUARDIAN LOOK AT HER FROM UNDER HIS THICK
EYEBROWS AND RAISE THEM A LITTLE WHEN HER LOVELINESS WAS BEFORE HIM
WITH THOSE RICH FLUSHES OF GLITTER AND COLOUR IN IT

ILLUSTRATION

OF THE MANNER AND EXTENT TO WHICH HE TOOK OUR TRUMPS INTO CUSTODY AND
CAME OUT WITH MEAN LITTLE CARDS AT THE ENDS OF HANDS BEFORE WHICH THE
GLORY OF OUR KINGS AND QUEENS WAS UTTERLY ABASED I SAY NOTHING NOR
OF THE FEELING THAT I HAD RESPECTING HIS LOOKING UPON US PERSONALLY IN
THE LIGHT OF THREE VERY OBVIOUS AND POOR RIDDLES THAT HE HAD FOUND OUT
LONG AGO WHAT I SUFFERED FROM WAS THE INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN HIS
COLD PRESENCE AND MY FEELINGS TOWARDS ESTELLA IT WAS NOT THAT I KNEW I
COULD NEVER BEAR TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT HER THAT I KNEW I COULD NEVER
BEAR TO HEAR HIM CREAK HIS BOOTS AT HER THAT I KNEW I COULD NEVER BEAR
TO SEE HIM WASH HIS HANDS OF HER IT WAS THAT MY ADMIRATION SHOULD BE
WITHIN A FOOT OR TWO OF HIMIT WAS THAT MY FEELINGS SHOULD BE IN THE
SAME PLACE WITH HIMTHAT WAS THE AGONIZING CIRCUMSTANCE

WE PLAYED UNTIL NINE OCLOCK AND THEN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT WHEN
ESTELLA CAME TO LONDON I SHOULD BE FOREWARNED OF HER COMING AND SHOULD
MEET HER AT THE COACH AND THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HER AND TOUCHED HER
AND LEFT HER

MY GUARDIAN LAY AT THE BOAR IN THE NEXT ROOM TO MINE FAR INTO THE
NIGHT MISS HAVISHAMS WORDS LOVE HER LOVE HER LOVE HER SOUNDED
IN MY EARS I ADAPTED THEM FOR MY OWN REPETITION AND SAID TO MY
PILLOW I LOVE HER I LOVE HER I LOVE HER HUNDREDS OF TIMES THEN
A BURST OF GRATITUDE CAME UPON ME THAT SHE SHOULD BE DESTINED FOR ME
ONCE THE BLACKSMITHS BOY THEN I THOUGHT IF SHE WERE AS I FEARED BY
NO MEANS RAPTUROUSLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT DESTINY YET WHEN WOULD SHE
BEGIN TO BE INTERESTED IN ME WHEN SHOULD I AWAKEN THE HEART WITHIN HER
THAT WAS MUTE AND SLEEPING NOW

AH ME I THOUGHT THOSE WERE HIGH AND GREAT EMOTIONS BUT I NEVER
THOUGHT THERE WAS ANYTHING LOW AND SMALL IN MY KEEPING AWAY FROM JOE
BECAUSE I KNEW SHE WOULD BE CONTEMPTUOUS OF HIM IT WAS BUT A DAY GONE
AND JOE HAD BROUGHT THE TEARS INTO MY EYES THEY HAD SOON DRIED GOD
FORGIVE ME SOON DRIED




CHAPTER XXX


AFTER WELL CONSIDERING THE MATTER WHILE I WAS DRESSING AT THE BLUE BOAR
IN THE MORNING I RESOLVED TO TELL MY GUARDIAN THAT I DOUBTED ORLICKS
BEING THE RIGHT SORT OF MAN TO FILL A POST OF TRUST AT MISS HAVISHAMS
WHY OF COURSE HE IS NOT THE RIGHT SORT OF MAN PIP SAID MY GUARDIAN
COMFORTABLY SATISFIED BEFOREHAND ON THE GENERAL HEAD BECAUSE THE MAN
WHO FILLS THE POST OF TRUST NEVER IS THE RIGHT SORT OF MAN IT SEEMED
QUITE TO PUT HIM INTO SPIRITS TO FIND THAT THIS PARTICULAR POST WAS NOT
EXCEPTIONALLY HELD BY THE RIGHT SORT OF MAN AND HE LISTENED IN A
SATISFIED MANNER WHILE I TOLD HIM WHAT KNOWLEDGE I HAD OF ORLICK VERY
GOOD PIP HE OBSERVED WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED ILL GO ROUND
PRESENTLY AND PAY OUR FRIEND OFF RATHER ALARMED BY THIS SUMMARY
ACTION I WAS FOR A LITTLE DELAY AND EVEN HINTED THAT OUR FRIEND
HIMSELF MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH OH NO HE WONT SAID MY
GUARDIAN MAKING HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEFPOINT WITH PERFECT
CONFIDENCE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM ARGUE THE QUESTION WITH ME

AS WE WERE GOING BACK TOGETHER TO LONDON BY THE MIDDAY COACH AND AS I
BREAKFASTED UNDER SUCH TERRORS OF PUMBLECHOOK THAT I COULD SCARCELY
HOLD MY CUP THIS GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING THAT I WANTED A
WALK AND THAT I WOULD GO ON ALONG THE LONDON ROAD WHILE MR JAGGERS
WAS OCCUPIED IF HE WOULD LET THE COACHMAN KNOW THAT I WOULD GET INTO
MY PLACE WHEN OVERTAKEN I WAS THUS ENABLED TO FLY FROM THE BLUE BOAR
IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST BY THEN MAKING A LOOP OF ABOUT A COUPLE OF
MILES INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY AT THE BACK OF PUMBLECHOOKS PREMISES I
GOT ROUND INTO THE HIGH STREET AGAIN A LITTLE BEYOND THAT PITFALL AND
FELT MYSELF IN COMPARATIVE SECURITY

IT WAS INTERESTING TO BE IN THE QUIET OLD TOWN ONCE MORE AND IT WAS
NOT DISAGREEABLE TO BE HERE AND THERE SUDDENLY RECOGNISED AND STARED
AFTER ONE OR TWO OF THE TRADESPEOPLE EVEN DARTED OUT OF THEIR SHOPS
AND WENT A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE STREET BEFORE ME THAT THEY MIGHT TURN
AS IF THEY HAD FORGOTTEN SOMETHING AND PASS ME FACE TO FACEON WHICH
OCCASIONS I DONT KNOW WHETHER THEY OR I MADE THE WORSE PRETENCE THEY
OF NOT DOING IT OR I OF NOT SEEING IT STILL MY POSITION WAS A
DISTINGUISHED ONE AND I WAS NOT AT ALL DISSATISFIED WITH IT UNTIL
FATE THREW ME IN THE WAY OF THAT UNLIMITED MISCREANT TRABBS BOY

CASTING MY EYES ALONG THE STREET AT A CERTAIN POINT OF MY PROGRESS I
BEHELD TRABBS BOY APPROACHING LASHING HIMSELF WITH AN EMPTY BLUE BAG
DEEMING THAT A SERENE AND UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPLATION OF HIM WOULD BEST
BESEEM ME AND WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO QUELL HIS EVIL MIND I ADVANCED
WITH THAT EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE AND WAS RATHER CONGRATULATING
MYSELF ON MY SUCCESS WHEN SUDDENLY THE KNEES OF TRABBS BOY SMOTE
TOGETHER HIS HAIR UPROSE HIS CAP FELL OFF HE TREMBLED VIOLENTLY IN
EVERY LIMB STAGGERED OUT INTO THE ROAD AND CRYING TO THE POPULACE
HOLD ME IM SO FRIGHTENED FEIGNED TO BE IN A PAROXYSM OF TERROR AND
CONTRITION OCCASIONED BY THE DIGNITY OF MY APPEARANCE AS I PASSED
HIM HIS TEETH LOUDLY CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AND WITH EVERY MARK OF
EXTREME HUMILIATION HE PROSTRATED HIMSELF IN THE DUST

THIS WAS A HARD THING TO BEAR BUT THIS WAS NOTHING I HAD NOT ADVANCED
ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED YARDS WHEN TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE TERROR AMAZEMENT
AND INDIGNATION I AGAIN BEHELD TRABBS BOY APPROACHING HE WAS COMING
ROUND A NARROW CORNER HIS BLUE BAG WAS SLUNG OVER HIS SHOULDER HONEST
INDUSTRY BEAMED IN HIS EYES A DETERMINATION TO PROCEED TO TRABBS WITH
CHEERFUL BRISKNESS WAS INDICATED IN HIS GAIT WITH A SHOCK HE BECAME
AWARE OF ME AND WAS SEVERELY VISITED AS BEFORE BUT THIS TIME HIS
MOTION WAS ROTATORY AND HE STAGGERED ROUND AND ROUND ME WITH KNEES
MORE AFFLICTED AND WITH UPLIFTED HANDS AS IF BESEECHING FOR MERCY HIS
SUFFERINGS WERE HAILED WITH THE GREATEST JOY BY A KNOT OF SPECTATORS
AND I FELT UTTERLY CONFOUNDED

I HAD NOT GOT AS MUCH FURTHER DOWN THE STREET AS THE POSTOFFICE WHEN
I AGAIN BEHELD TRABBS BOY SHOOTING ROUND BY A BACK WAY THIS TIME HE
WAS ENTIRELY CHANGED HE WORE THE BLUE BAG IN THE MANNER OF MY
GREATCOAT AND WAS STRUTTING ALONG THE PAVEMENT TOWARDS ME ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET ATTENDED BY A COMPANY OF DELIGHTED YOUNG
FRIENDS TO WHOM HE FROM TIME TO TIME EXCLAIMED WITH A WAVE OF HIS
HAND DONT KNOW YAH WORDS CANNOT STATE THE AMOUNT OF AGGRAVATION
AND INJURY WREAKED UPON ME BY TRABBS BOY WHEN PASSING ABREAST OF ME
HE PULLED UP HIS SHIRTCOLLAR TWINED HIS SIDEHAIR STUCK AN ARM
AKIMBO AND SMIRKED EXTRAVAGANTLY BY WRIGGLING HIS ELBOWS AND BODY
AND DRAWLING TO HIS ATTENDANTS DONT KNOW YAH DONT KNOW YAH PON
MY SOUL DONT KNOW YAH THE DISGRACE ATTENDANT ON HIS IMMEDIATELY
AFTERWARDS TAKING TO CROWING AND PURSUING ME ACROSS THE BRIDGE WITH
CROWS AS FROM AN EXCEEDINGLY DEJECTED FOWL WHO HAD KNOWN ME WHEN I WAS
A BLACKSMITH CULMINATED THE DISGRACE WITH WHICH I LEFT THE TOWN AND
WAS SO TO SPEAK EJECTED BY IT INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY

ILLUSTRATION

BUT UNLESS I HAD TAKEN THE LIFE OF TRABBS BOY ON THAT OCCASION I
REALLY DO NOT EVEN NOW SEE WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE SAVE ENDURE TO HAVE
STRUGGLED WITH HIM IN THE STREET OR TO HAVE EXACTED ANY LOWER
RECOMPENSE FROM HIM THAN HIS HEARTS BEST BLOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN FUTILE
AND DEGRADING MOREOVER HE WAS A BOY WHOM NO MAN COULD HURT AN
INVULNERABLE AND DODGING SERPENT WHO WHEN CHASED INTO A CORNER FLEW
OUT AGAIN BETWEEN HIS CAPTORS LEGS SCORNFULLY YELPING I WROTE
HOWEVER TO MR TRABB BY NEXT DAYS POST TO SAY THAT MR PIP MUST
DECLINE TO DEAL FURTHER WITH ONE WHO COULD SO FAR FORGET WHAT HE OWED
TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AS TO EMPLOY A BOY WHO EXCITED
LOATHING IN EVERY RESPECTABLE MIND

THE COACH WITH MR JAGGERS INSIDE CAME UP IN DUE TIME AND I TOOK MY
BOXSEAT AGAIN AND ARRIVED IN LONDON SAFEBUT NOT SOUND FOR MY HEART
WAS GONE AS SOON AS I ARRIVED I SENT A PENITENTIAL CODFISH AND BARREL
OF OYSTERS TO JOE AS REPARATION FOR NOT HAVING GONE MYSELF AND THEN
WENT ON TO BARNARDS INN

I FOUND HERBERT DINING ON COLD MEAT AND DELIGHTED TO WELCOME ME BACK
HAVING DESPATCHED THE AVENGER TO THE COFFEEHOUSE FOR AN ADDITION TO
THE DINNER I FELT THAT I MUST OPEN MY BREAST THAT VERY EVENING TO MY
FRIEND AND CHUM AS CONFIDENCE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH THE AVENGER
IN THE HALL WHICH COULD MERELY BE REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF AN
ANTECHAMBER TO THE KEYHOLE I SENT HIM TO THE PLAY A BETTER PROOF OF
THE SEVERITY OF MY BONDAGE TO THAT TASKMASTER COULD SCARCELY BE
AFFORDED THAN THE DEGRADING SHIFTS TO WHICH I WAS CONSTANTLY DRIVEN TO
FIND HIM EMPLOYMENT SO MEAN IS EXTREMITY THAT I SOMETIMES SENT HIM TO
HYDE PARK CORNER TO SEE WHAT OCLOCK IT WAS

DINNER DONE AND WE SITTING WITH OUR FEET UPON THE FENDER I SAID TO
HERBERT MY DEAR HERBERT I HAVE SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR TO TELL
YOU

MY DEAR HANDEL HE RETURNED I SHALL ESTEEM AND RESPECT YOUR
CONFIDENCE

IT CONCERNS MYSELF HERBERT SAID I AND ONE OTHER PERSON

HERBERT CROSSED HIS FEET LOOKED AT THE FIRE WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE
AND HAVING LOOKED AT IT IN VAIN FOR SOME TIME LOOKED AT ME BECAUSE I
DIDNT GO ON

HERBERT SAID I LAYING MY HAND UPON HIS KNEE I LOVEI
ADOREESTELLA

INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSFIXED HERBERT REPLIED IN AN EASY
MATTEROFCOURSE WAY EXACTLY WELL

WELL HERBERT IS THAT ALL YOU SAY WELL

WHAT NEXT I MEAN SAID HERBERT OF COURSE I KNOW THAT

HOW DO YOU KNOW IT SAID I

HOW DO I KNOW IT HANDEL WHY FROM YOU

I NEVER TOLD YOU

TOLD ME YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ME WHEN YOU HAVE GOT YOUR HAIR CUT BUT I
HAVE HAD SENSES TO PERCEIVE IT YOU HAVE ALWAYS ADORED HER EVER SINCE
I HAVE KNOWN YOU YOU BROUGHT YOUR ADORATION AND YOUR PORTMANTEAU HERE
TOGETHER TOLD ME WHY YOU HAVE ALWAYS TOLD ME ALL DAY LONG WHEN YOU
TOLD ME YOUR OWN STORY YOU TOLD ME PLAINLY THAT YOU BEGAN ADORING HER
THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW HER WHEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG INDEED

VERY WELL THEN SAID I TO WHOM THIS WAS A NEW AND NOT UNWELCOME
LIGHT I HAVE NEVER LEFT OFF ADORING HER AND SHE HAS COME BACK A
MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST ELEGANT CREATURE AND I SAW HER YESTERDAY AND
IF I ADORED HER BEFORE I NOW DOUBLY ADORE HER

LUCKY FOR YOU THEN HANDEL SAID HERBERT THAT YOU ARE PICKED OUT
FOR HER AND ALLOTTED TO HER WITHOUT ENCROACHING ON FORBIDDEN GROUND
WE MAY VENTURE TO SAY THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT BETWEEN OURSELVES OF
THAT FACT HAVE YOU ANY IDEA YET OF ESTELLAS VIEWS ON THE ADORATION
QUESTION

I SHOOK MY HEAD GLOOMILY OH SHE IS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM
ME SAID I

PATIENCE MY DEAR HANDEL TIME ENOUGH TIME ENOUGH BUT YOU HAVE
SOMETHING MORE TO SAY

I AM ASHAMED TO SAY IT I RETURNED AND YET ITS NO WORSE TO SAY IT
THAN TO THINK IT YOU CALL ME A LUCKY FELLOW OF COURSE I AM I WAS A
BLACKSMITHS BOY BUT YESTERDAY I AMWHAT SHALL I SAY I AMTODAY

SAY A GOOD FELLOW IF YOU WANT A PHRASE RETURNED HERBERT SMILING
AND CLAPPING HIS HAND ON THE BACK OF MINEA GOOD FELLOW WITH
IMPETUOSITY AND HESITATION BOLDNESS AND DIFFIDENCE ACTION AND
DREAMING CURIOUSLY MIXED IN HIM

I STOPPED FOR A MOMENT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THERE REALLY WAS THIS
MIXTURE IN MY CHARACTER ON THE WHOLE I BY NO MEANS RECOGNISED THE
ANALYSIS BUT THOUGHT IT NOT WORTH DISPUTING

WHEN I ASK WHAT I AM TO CALL MYSELF TODAY HERBERT I WENT ON I
SUGGEST WHAT I HAVE IN MY THOUGHTS YOU SAY I AM LUCKY I KNOW I HAVE
DONE NOTHING TO RAISE MYSELF IN LIFE AND THAT FORTUNE ALONE HAS RAISED
ME THAT IS BEING VERY LUCKY AND YET WHEN I THINK OF ESTELLA

AND WHEN DONT YOU YOU KNOW HERBERT THREW IN WITH HIS EYES ON THE
FIRE WHICH I THOUGHT KIND AND SYMPATHETIC OF HIM

THEN MY DEAR HERBERT I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW DEPENDENT AND UNCERTAIN
I FEEL AND HOW EXPOSED TO HUNDREDS OF CHANCES AVOIDING FORBIDDEN
GROUND AS YOU DID JUST NOW I MAY STILL SAY THAT ON THE CONSTANCY OF
ONE PERSON NAMING NO PERSON ALL MY EXPECTATIONS DEPEND AND AT THE
BEST HOW INDEFINITE AND UNSATISFACTORY ONLY TO KNOW SO VAGUELY WHAT
THEY ARE IN SAYING THIS I RELIEVED MY MIND OF WHAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN
THERE MORE OR LESS THOUGH NO DOUBT MOST SINCE YESTERDAY

NOW HANDEL HERBERT REPLIED IN HIS GAY HOPEFUL WAY IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT IN THE DESPONDENCY OF THE TENDER PASSION WE ARE LOOKING INTO
OUR GIFTHORSES MOUTH WITH A MAGNIFYINGGLASS LIKEWISE IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT CONCENTRATING OUR ATTENTION ON THE EXAMINATION WE ALTOGETHER
OVERLOOK ONE OF THE BEST POINTS OF THE ANIMAL DIDNT YOU TELL ME THAT
YOUR GUARDIAN MR JAGGERS TOLD YOU IN THE BEGINNING THAT YOU WERE
NOT ENDOWED WITH EXPECTATIONS ONLY AND EVEN IF HE HAD NOT TOLD YOU
SOTHOUGH THAT IS A VERY LARGE IF I GRANTCOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT OF
ALL MEN IN LONDON MR JAGGERS IS THE MAN TO HOLD HIS PRESENT RELATIONS
TOWARDS YOU UNLESS HE WERE SURE OF HIS GROUND

I SAID I COULD NOT DENY THAT THIS WAS A STRONG POINT I SAID IT PEOPLE
OFTEN DO SO IN SUCH CASES LIKE A RATHER RELUCTANT CONCESSION TO TRUTH
AND JUSTICEAS IF I WANTED TO DENY IT

I SHOULD THINK IT WAS A STRONG POINT SAID HERBERT AND I SHOULD
THINK YOU WOULD BE PUZZLED TO IMAGINE A STRONGER AS TO THE REST YOU
MUST BIDE YOUR GUARDIANS TIME AND HE MUST BIDE HIS CLIENTS TIME
YOULL BE ONEANDTWENTY BEFORE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND THEN
PERHAPS YOULL GET SOME FURTHER ENLIGHTENMENT AT ALL EVENTS YOULL BE
NEARER GETTING IT FOR IT MUST COME AT LAST

WHAT A HOPEFUL DISPOSITION YOU HAVE SAID I GRATEFULLY ADMIRING HIS
CHEERY WAYS

I OUGHT TO HAVE SAID HERBERT FOR I HAVE NOT MUCH ELSE I MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE BY THE BY THAT THE GOOD SENSE OF WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID IS
NOT MY OWN BUT MY FATHERS THE ONLY REMARK I EVER HEARD HIM MAKE ON
YOUR STORY WAS THE FINAL ONE THE THING IS SETTLED AND DONE OR MR
JAGGERS WOULD NOT BE IN IT AND NOW BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT
MY FATHER OR MY FATHERS SON AND REPAY CONFIDENCE WITH CONFIDENCE I
WANT TO MAKE MYSELF SERIOUSLY DISAGREEABLE TO YOU FOR A
MOMENTPOSITIVELY REPULSIVE

YOU WONT SUCCEED SAID I

O YES I SHALL SAID HE ONE TWO THREE AND NOW I AM IN FOR IT
HANDEL MY GOOD FELLOWTHOUGH HE SPOKE IN THIS LIGHT TONE HE WAS
VERY MUCH IN EARNESTI HAVE BEEN THINKING SINCE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
WITH OUR FEET ON THIS FENDER THAT ESTELLA SURELY CANNOT BE A CONDITION
OF YOUR INHERITANCE IF SHE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO BY YOUR GUARDIAN AM
I RIGHT IN SO UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME AS THAT HE NEVER
REFERRED TO HER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN ANY WAY NEVER EVEN HINTED
FOR INSTANCE THAT YOUR PATRON MIGHT HAVE VIEWS AS TO YOUR MARRIAGE
ULTIMATELY

NEVER

NOW HANDEL I AM QUITE FREE FROM THE FLAVOUR OF SOUR GRAPES UPON MY
SOUL AND HONOUR NOT BEING BOUND TO HER CAN YOU NOT DETACH YOURSELF
FROM HERI TOLD YOU I SHOULD BE DISAGREEABLE

I TURNED MY HEAD ASIDE FOR WITH A RUSH AND A SWEEP LIKE THE OLD
MARSH WINDS COMING UP FROM THE SEA A FEELING LIKE THAT WHICH HAD
SUBDUED ME ON THE MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE FORGE WHEN THE MISTS WERE
SOLEMNLY RISING AND WHEN I LAID MY HAND UPON THE VILLAGE FINGERPOST
SMOTE UPON MY HEART AGAIN THERE WAS SILENCE BETWEEN US FOR A LITTLE
WHILE

YES BUT MY DEAR HANDEL HERBERT WENT ON AS IF WE HAD BEEN TALKING
INSTEAD OF SILENT ITS HAVING BEEN SO STRONGLY ROOTED IN THE BREAST OF
A BOY WHOM NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES MADE SO ROMANTIC RENDERS IT VERY
SERIOUS THINK OF HER BRINGINGUP AND THINK OF MISS HAVISHAM THINK OF
WHAT SHE IS HERSELF NOW I AM REPULSIVE AND YOU ABOMINATE ME THIS MAY
LEAD TO MISERABLE THINGS

I KNOW IT HERBERT SAID I WITH MY HEAD STILL TURNED AWAY BUT I
CANT HELP IT

YOU CANT DETACH YOURSELF

NO IMPOSSIBLE

YOU CANT TRY HANDEL

NO IMPOSSIBLE

WELL SAID HERBERT GETTING UP WITH A LIVELY SHAKE AS IF HE HAD BEEN
ASLEEP AND STIRRING THE FIRE NOW ILL ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE MYSELF
AGREEABLE AGAIN

SO HE WENT ROUND THE ROOM AND SHOOK THE CURTAINS OUT PUT THE CHAIRS IN
THEIR PLACES TIDIED THE BOOKS AND SO FORTH THAT WERE LYING ABOUT
LOOKED INTO THE HALL PEEPED INTO THE LETTERBOX SHUT THE DOOR AND
CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE WHERE HE SAT DOWN NURSING HIS LEFT
LEG IN BOTH ARMS

I WAS GOING TO SAY A WORD OR TWO HANDEL CONCERNING MY FATHER AND MY
FATHERS SON I AM AFRAID IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY FOR MY FATHERS SON
TO REMARK THAT MY FATHERS ESTABLISHMENT IS NOT PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT
IN ITS HOUSEKEEPING

THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY HERBERT SAID I TO SAY SOMETHING
ENCOURAGING

O YES AND SO THE DUSTMAN SAYS I BELIEVE WITH THE STRONGEST
APPROVAL AND SO DOES THE MARINESTORE SHOP IN THE BACK STREET
GRAVELY HANDEL FOR THE SUBJECT IS GRAVE ENOUGH YOU KNOW HOW IT IS AS
WELL AS I DO I SUPPOSE THERE WAS A TIME ONCE WHEN MY FATHER HAD NOT
GIVEN MATTERS UP BUT IF EVER THERE WAS THE TIME IS GONE MAY I ASK
YOU IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF REMARKING DOWN IN YOUR PART
OF THE COUNTRY THAT THE CHILDREN OF NOT EXACTLY SUITABLE MARRIAGES ARE
ALWAYS MOST PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO BE MARRIED

THIS WAS SUCH A SINGULAR QUESTION THAT I ASKED HIM IN RETURN IS IT
SO

I DONT KNOW SAID HERBERT THATS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE IT
IS DECIDEDLY THE CASE WITH US MY POOR SISTER CHARLOTTE WHO WAS NEXT
ME AND DIED BEFORE SHE WAS FOURTEEN WAS A STRIKING EXAMPLE LITTLE
JANE IS THE SAME IN HER DESIRE TO BE MATRIMONIALLY ESTABLISHED YOU
MIGHT SUPPOSE HER TO HAVE PASSED HER SHORT EXISTENCE IN THE PERPETUAL
CONTEMPLATION OF DOMESTIC BLISS LITTLE ALICK IN A FROCK HAS ALREADY
MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS UNION WITH A SUITABLE YOUNG PERSON AT KEW
AND INDEED I THINK WE ARE ALL ENGAGED EXCEPT THE BABY

THEN YOU ARE SAID I

I AM SAID HERBERT BUT ITS A SECRET

I ASSURED HIM OF MY KEEPING THE SECRET AND BEGGED TO BE FAVOURED WITH
FURTHER PARTICULARS HE HAD SPOKEN SO SENSIBLY AND FEELINGLY OF MY
WEAKNESS THAT I WANTED TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS STRENGTH

MAY I ASK THE NAME I SAID

NAME OF CLARA SAID HERBERT

LIVE IN LONDON

YES PERHAPS I OUGHT TO MENTION SAID HERBERT WHO HAD BECOME
CURIOUSLY CRESTFALLEN AND MEEK SINCE WE ENTERED ON THE INTERESTING
THEME THAT SHE IS RATHER BELOW MY MOTHERS NONSENSICAL FAMILY
NOTIONS HER FATHER HAD TO DO WITH THE VICTUALLING OF PASSENGERSHIPS
I THINK HE WAS A SPECIES OF PURSER

WHAT IS HE NOW SAID I

HES AN INVALID NOW REPLIED HERBERT

LIVING ON

ON THE FIRST FLOOR SAID HERBERT WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I MEANT
FOR I HAD INTENDED MY QUESTION TO APPLY TO HIS MEANS I HAVE NEVER
SEEN HIM FOR HE HAS ALWAYS KEPT HIS ROOM OVERHEAD SINCE I HAVE KNOWN
CLARA BUT I HAVE HEARD HIM CONSTANTLY HE MAKES TREMENDOUS
ROWSROARS AND PEGS AT THE FLOOR WITH SOME FRIGHTFUL INSTRUMENT IN
LOOKING AT ME AND THEN LAUGHING HEARTILY HERBERT FOR THE TIME
RECOVERED HIS USUAL LIVELY MANNER

DONT YOU EXPECT TO SEE HIM SAID I

O YES I CONSTANTLY EXPECT TO SEE HIM RETURNED HERBERT BECAUSE I
NEVER HEAR HIM WITHOUT EXPECTING HIM TO COME TUMBLING THROUGH THE
CEILING BUT I DONT KNOW HOW LONG THE RAFTERS MAY HOLD

WHEN HE HAD ONCE MORE LAUGHED HEARTILY HE BECAME MEEK AGAIN AND TOLD
ME THAT THE MOMENT HE BEGAN TO REALISE CAPITAL IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO
MARRY THIS YOUNG LADY HE ADDED AS A SELFEVIDENT PROPOSITION
ENGENDERING LOW SPIRITS BUT YOU CANT MARRY YOU KNOW WHILE YOURE
LOOKING ABOUT YOU

AS WE CONTEMPLATED THE FIRE AND AS I THOUGHT WHAT A DIFFICULT VISION
TO REALISE THIS SAME CAPITAL SOMETIMES WAS I PUT MY HANDS IN MY
POCKETS A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER IN ONE OF THEM ATTRACTING MY
ATTENTION I OPENED IT AND FOUND IT TO BE THE PLAYBILL I HAD RECEIVED
FROM JOE RELATIVE TO THE CELEBRATED PROVINCIAL AMATEUR OF ROSCIAN
RENOWN AND BLESS MY HEART I INVOLUNTARILY ADDED ALOUD ITS
TONIGHT

THIS CHANGED THE SUBJECT IN AN INSTANT AND MADE US HURRIEDLY RESOLVE
TO GO TO THE PLAY SO WHEN I HAD PLEDGED MYSELF TO COMFORT AND ABET
HERBERT IN THE AFFAIR OF HIS HEART BY ALL PRACTICABLE AND IMPRACTICABLE
MEANS AND WHEN HERBERT HAD TOLD ME THAT HIS AFFIANCED ALREADY KNEW ME
BY REPUTATION AND THAT I SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO HER AND WHEN WE HAD
WARMLY SHAKEN HANDS UPON OUR MUTUAL CONFIDENCE WE BLEW OUT OUR
CANDLES MADE UP OUR FIRE LOCKED OUR DOOR AND ISSUED FORTH IN QUEST
OF MR WOPSLE AND DENMARK




CHAPTER XXXI


ON OUR ARRIVAL IN DENMARK WE FOUND THE KING AND QUEEN OF THAT COUNTRY
ELEVATED IN TWO ARMCHAIRS ON A KITCHENTABLE HOLDING A COURT THE
WHOLE OF THE DANISH NOBILITY WERE IN ATTENDANCE CONSISTING OF A NOBLE
BOY IN THE WASHLEATHER BOOTS OF A GIGANTIC ANCESTOR A VENERABLE PEER
WITH A DIRTY FACE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN FROM THE PEOPLE LATE IN
LIFE AND THE DANISH CHIVALRY WITH A COMB IN ITS HAIR AND A PAIR OF
WHITE SILK LEGS AND PRESENTING ON THE WHOLE A FEMININE APPEARANCE MY
GIFTED TOWNSMAN STOOD GLOOMILY APART WITH FOLDED ARMS AND I COULD
HAVE WISHED THAT HIS CURLS AND FOREHEAD HAD BEEN MORE PROBABLE

SEVERAL CURIOUS LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES TRANSPIRED AS THE ACTION
PROCEEDED THE LATE KING OF THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN
TROUBLED WITH A COUGH AT THE TIME OF HIS DECEASE BUT TO HAVE TAKEN IT
WITH HIM TO THE TOMB AND TO HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK THE ROYAL PHANTOM
ALSO CARRIED A GHOSTLY MANUSCRIPT ROUND ITS TRUNCHEON TO WHICH IT HAD
THE APPEARANCE OF OCCASIONALLY REFERRING AND THAT TOO WITH AN AIR OF
ANXIETY AND A TENDENCY TO LOSE THE PLACE OF REFERENCE WHICH WERE
SUGGESTIVE OF A STATE OF MORTALITY IT WAS THIS I CONCEIVE WHICH LED
TO THE SHADES BEING ADVISED BY THE GALLERY TO TURN OVERA
RECOMMENDATION WHICH IT TOOK EXTREMELY ILL IT WAS LIKEWISE TO BE NOTED
OF THIS MAJESTIC SPIRIT THAT WHEREAS IT ALWAYS APPEARED WITH AN AIR OF
HAVING BEEN OUT A LONG TIME AND WALKED AN IMMENSE DISTANCE IT
PERCEPTIBLY CAME FROM A CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS WALL THIS OCCASIONED ITS
TERRORS TO BE RECEIVED DERISIVELY THE QUEEN OF DENMARK A VERY BUXOM
LADY THOUGH NO DOUBT HISTORICALLY BRAZEN WAS CONSIDERED BY THE PUBLIC
TO HAVE TOO MUCH BRASS ABOUT HER HER CHIN BEING ATTACHED TO HER DIADEM
BY A BROAD BAND OF THAT METAL AS IF SHE HAD A GORGEOUS TOOTHACHE HER
WAIST BEING ENCIRCLED BY ANOTHER AND EACH OF HER ARMS BY ANOTHER SO
THAT SHE WAS OPENLY MENTIONED AS THE KETTLEDRUM THE NOBLE BOY IN
THE ANCESTRAL BOOTS WAS INCONSISTENT REPRESENTING HIMSELF AS IT WERE
IN ONE BREATH AS AN ABLE SEAMAN A STROLLING ACTOR A GRAVEDIGGER A
CLERGYMAN AND A PERSON OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AT A COURT
FENCINGMATCH ON THE AUTHORITY OF WHOSE PRACTISED EYE AND NICE
DISCRIMINATION THE FINEST STROKES WERE JUDGED THIS GRADUALLY LED TO A
WANT OF TOLERATION FOR HIM AND EVENON HIS BEING DETECTED IN HOLY
ORDERS AND DECLINING TO PERFORM THE FUNERAL SERVICETO THE GENERAL
INDIGNATION TAKING THE FORM OF NUTS LASTLY OPHELIA WAS A PREY TO SUCH
SLOW MUSICAL MADNESS THAT WHEN IN COURSE OF TIME SHE HAD TAKEN OFF
HER WHITE MUSLIN SCARF FOLDED IT UP AND BURIED IT A SULKY MAN WHO
HAD BEEN LONG COOLING HIS IMPATIENT NOSE AGAINST AN IRON BAR IN THE
FRONT ROW OF THE GALLERY GROWLED NOW THE BABYS PUT TO BED LETS
HAVE SUPPER WHICH TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT WAS OUT OF KEEPING

UPON MY UNFORTUNATE TOWNSMAN ALL THESE INCIDENTS ACCUMULATED WITH
PLAYFUL EFFECT WHENEVER THAT UNDECIDED PRINCE HAD TO ASK A QUESTION OR
STATE A DOUBT THE PUBLIC HELPED HIM OUT WITH IT AS FOR EXAMPLE ON
THE QUESTION WHETHER TWAS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER SOME ROARED
YES AND SOME NO AND SOME INCLINING TO BOTH OPINIONS SAID TOSS UP FOR
IT AND QUITE A DEBATING SOCIETY AROSE WHEN HE ASKED WHAT SHOULD SUCH
FELLOWS AS HE DO CRAWLING BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN HE WAS ENCOURAGED
WITH LOUD CRIES OF HEAR HEAR WHEN HE APPEARED WITH HIS STOCKING
DISORDERED ITS DISORDER EXPRESSED ACCORDING TO USAGE BY ONE VERY
NEAT FOLD IN THE TOP WHICH I SUPPOSE TO BE ALWAYS GOT UP WITH A FLAT
IRON A CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE IN THE GALLERY RESPECTING THE PALENESS
OF HIS LEG AND WHETHER IT WAS OCCASIONED BY THE TURN THE GHOST HAD
GIVEN HIM ON HIS TAKING THE RECORDERSVERY LIKE A LITTLE BLACK FLUTE
THAT HAD JUST BEEN PLAYED IN THE ORCHESTRA AND HANDED OUT AT THE
DOORHE WAS CALLED UPON UNANIMOUSLY FOR RULE BRITANNIA WHEN HE
RECOMMENDED THE PLAYER NOT TO SAW THE AIR THUS THE SULKY MAN SAID
AND DONT YOU DO IT NEITHER YOURE A DEAL WORSE THAN HIM AND I
GRIEVE TO ADD THAT PEALS OF LAUGHTER GREETED MR WOPSLE ON EVERY ONE OF
THESE OCCASIONS

BUT HIS GREATEST TRIALS WERE IN THE CHURCHYARD WHICH HAD THE
APPEARANCE OF A PRIMEVAL FOREST WITH A KIND OF SMALL ECCLESIASTICAL
WASHHOUSE ON ONE SIDE AND A TURNPIKE GATE ON THE OTHER MR WOPSLE IN
A COMPREHENSIVE BLACK CLOAK BEING DESCRIED ENTERING AT THE TURNPIKE
THE GRAVEDIGGER WAS ADMONISHED IN A FRIENDLY WAY LOOK OUT HERES THE
UNDERTAKER A COMING TO SEE HOW YOURE A GETTING ON WITH YOUR WORK I
BELIEVE IT IS WELL KNOWN IN A CONSTITUTIONAL COUNTRY THAT MR WOPSLE
COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE RETURNED THE SKULL AFTER MORALIZING OVER IT
WITHOUT DUSTING HIS FINGERS ON A WHITE NAPKIN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST
BUT EVEN THAT INNOCENT AND INDISPENSABLE ACTION DID NOT PASS WITHOUT
THE COMMENT WAITER THE ARRIVAL OF THE BODY FOR INTERMENT IN AN
EMPTY BLACK BOX WITH THE LID TUMBLING OPEN WAS THE SIGNAL FOR A
GENERAL JOY WHICH WAS MUCH ENHANCED BY THE DISCOVERY AMONG THE
BEARERS OF AN INDIVIDUAL OBNOXIOUS TO IDENTIFICATION THE JOY ATTENDED
MR WOPSLE THROUGH HIS STRUGGLE WITH LAERTES ON THE BRINK OF THE
ORCHESTRA AND THE GRAVE AND SLACKENED NO MORE UNTIL HE HAD TUMBLED THE
KING OFF THE KITCHENTABLE AND HAD DIED BY INCHES FROM THE ANKLES
UPWARD

WE HAD MADE SOME PALE EFFORTS IN THE BEGINNING TO APPLAUD MR WOPSLE
BUT THEY WERE TOO HOPELESS TO BE PERSISTED IN THEREFORE WE HAD SAT
FEELING KEENLY FOR HIM BUT LAUGHING NEVERTHELESS FROM EAR TO EAR I
LAUGHED IN SPITE OF MYSELF ALL THE TIME THE WHOLE THING WAS SO DROLL
AND YET I HAD A LATENT IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DECIDEDLY
FINE IN MR WOPSLES ELOCUTIONNOT FOR OLD ASSOCIATIONS SAKE I AM
AFRAID BUT BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SLOW VERY DREARY VERY UPHILL AND
DOWNHILL AND VERY UNLIKE ANY WAY IN WHICH ANY MAN IN ANY NATURAL
CIRCUMSTANCES OF LIFE OR DEATH EVER EXPRESSED HIMSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
WHEN THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER AND HE HAD BEEN CALLED FOR AND HOOTED I
SAID TO HERBERT LET US GO AT ONCE OR PERHAPS WE SHALL MEET HIM

WE MADE ALL THE HASTE WE COULD DOWNSTAIRS BUT WE WERE NOT QUICK ENOUGH
EITHER STANDING AT THE DOOR WAS A JEWISH MAN WITH AN UNNATURAL HEAVY
SMEAR OF EYEBROW WHO CAUGHT MY EYES AS WE ADVANCED AND SAID WHEN WE
CAME UP WITH HIM

MR PIP AND FRIEND

IDENTITY OF MR PIP AND FRIEND CONFESSED

MR WALDENGARVER SAID THE MAN WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE THE HONOUR

WALDENGARVER I REPEATEDWHEN HERBERT MURMURED IN MY EAR PROBABLY
WOPSLE

OH SAID I YES SHALL WE FOLLOW YOU

A FEW STEPS PLEASE WHEN WE WERE IN A SIDE ALLEY HE TURNED AND
ASKED HOW DID YOU THINK HE LOOKEDI DRESSED HIM

I DONT KNOW WHAT HE HAD LOOKED LIKE EXCEPT A FUNERAL WITH THE
ADDITION OF A LARGE DANISH SUN OR STAR HANGING ROUND HIS NECK BY A BLUE
RIBBON THAT HAD GIVEN HIM THE APPEARANCE OF BEING INSURED IN SOME
EXTRAORDINARY FIRE OFFICE BUT I SAID HE HAD LOOKED VERY NICE

WHEN HE COME TO THE GRAVE SAID OUR CONDUCTOR HE SHOWED HIS CLOAK
BEAUTIFUL BUT JUDGING FROM THE WING IT LOOKED TO ME THAT WHEN HE SEE
THE GHOST IN THE QUEENS APARTMENT HE MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE OF HIS
STOCKINGS

I MODESTLY ASSENTED AND WE ALL FELL THROUGH A LITTLE DIRTY SWING DOOR
INTO A SORT OF HOT PACKINGCASE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT HERE MR WOPSLE
WAS DIVESTING HIMSELF OF HIS DANISH GARMENTS AND HERE THERE WAS JUST
ROOM FOR US TO LOOK AT HIM OVER ONE ANOTHERS SHOULDERS BY KEEPING THE
PACKINGCASE DOOR OR LID WIDE OPEN

GENTLEMEN SAID MR WOPSLE I AM PROUD TO SEE YOU I HOPE MR PIP
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY SENDING ROUND I HAD THE HAPPINESS TO KNOW YOU IN
FORMER TIMES AND THE DRAMA HAS EVER HAD A CLAIM WHICH HAS EVER BEEN
ACKNOWLEDGED ON THE NOBLE AND THE AFFLUENT

MEANWHILE MR WALDENGARVER IN A FRIGHTFUL PERSPIRATION WAS TRYING TO
GET HIMSELF OUT OF HIS PRINCELY SABLES

SKIN THE STOCKINGS OFF MR WALDENGARVER SAID THE OWNER OF THAT
PROPERTY OR YOULL BUST EM BUST EM AND YOULL BUST
FIVEANDTHIRTY SHILLINGS SHAKSPEARE NEVER WAS COMPLIMENTED WITH A
FINER PAIR KEEP QUIET IN YOUR CHAIR NOW AND LEAVE EM TO ME

WITH THAT HE WENT UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO FLAY HIS VICTIM WHO
ON THE FIRST STOCKING COMING OFF WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FALLEN OVER
BACKWARD WITH HIS CHAIR BUT FOR THERE BEING NO ROOM TO FALL ANYHOW

I HAD BEEN AFRAID UNTIL THEN TO SAY A WORD ABOUT THE PLAY BUT THEN
MR WALDENGARVER LOOKED UP AT US COMPLACENTLY AND SAID

GENTLEMEN HOW DID IT SEEM TO YOU TO GO IN FRONT

HERBERT SAID FROM BEHIND AT THE SAME TIME POKING ME CAPITALLY SO
I SAID CAPITALLY

HOW DID YOU LIKE MY READING OF THE CHARACTER GENTLEMEN SAID MR
WALDENGARVER ALMOST IF NOT QUITE WITH PATRONAGE

HERBERT SAID FROM BEHIND AGAIN POKING ME MASSIVE AND CONCRETE SO
I SAID BOLDLY AS IF I HAD ORIGINATED IT AND MUST BEG TO INSIST UPON
IT MASSIVE AND CONCRETE

I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOUR APPROBATION GENTLEMEN SAID MR WALDENGARVER
WITH AN AIR OF DIGNITY IN SPITE OF HIS BEING GROUND AGAINST THE WALL
AT THE TIME AND HOLDING ON BY THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR

BUT ILL TELL YOU ONE THING MR WALDENGARVER SAID THE MAN WHO WAS
ON HIS KNEES IN WHICH YOURE OUT IN YOUR READING NOW MIND I DONT
CARE WHO SAYS CONTRAIRY I TELL YOU SO YOURE OUT IN YOUR READING OF
HAMLET WHEN YOU GET YOUR LEGS IN PROFILE THE LAST HAMLET AS I DRESSED
MADE THE SAME MISTAKES IN HIS READING AT REHEARSAL TILL I GOT HIM TO
PUT A LARGE RED WAFER ON EACH OF HIS SHINS AND THEN AT THAT REHEARSAL
WHICH WAS THE LAST I WENT IN FRONT SIR TO THE BACK OF THE PIT AND
WHENEVER HIS READING BROUGHT HIM INTO PROFILE I CALLED OUT I DONT
SEE NO WAFERS AND AT NIGHT HIS READING WAS LOVELY

MR WALDENGARVER SMILED AT ME AS MUCH AS TO SAY A FAITHFUL
DEPENDENTI OVERLOOK HIS FOLLY AND THEN SAID ALOUD MY VIEW IS A
LITTLE CLASSIC AND THOUGHTFUL FOR THEM HERE BUT THEY WILL IMPROVE
THEY WILL IMPROVE

HERBERT AND I SAID TOGETHER O NO DOUBT THEY WOULD IMPROVE

DID YOU OBSERVE GENTLEMEN SAID MR WALDENGARVER THAT THERE WAS A
MAN IN THE GALLERY WHO ENDEAVOURED TO CAST DERISION ON THE SERVICEI
MEAN THE REPRESENTATION

WE BASELY REPLIED THAT WE RATHER THOUGHT WE HAD NOTICED SUCH A MAN I
ADDED HE WAS DRUNK NO DOUBT

O DEAR NO SIR SAID MR WOPSLE NOT DRUNK HIS EMPLOYER WOULD SEE
TO THAT SIR HIS EMPLOYER WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE DRUNK

YOU KNOW HIS EMPLOYER SAID I

MR WOPSLE SHUT HIS EYES AND OPENED THEM AGAIN PERFORMING BOTH
CEREMONIES VERY SLOWLY YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED GENTLEMEN SAID HE
AN IGNORANT AND A BLATANT ASS WITH A RASPING THROAT AND A COUNTENANCE
EXPRESSIVE OF LOW MALIGNITY WHO WENT THROUGHI WILL NOT SAY
SUSTAINEDTHE RLE IF I MAY USE A FRENCH EXPRESSION OF CLAUDIUS KING
OF DENMARK THAT IS HIS EMPLOYER GENTLEMEN SUCH IS THE PROFESSION

WITHOUT DISTINCTLY KNOWING WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SORRY FOR
MR WOPSLE IF HE HAD BEEN IN DESPAIR I WAS SO SORRY FOR HIM AS IT WAS
THAT I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF HIS TURNING ROUND TO HAVE HIS BRACES PUT
ONWHICH JOSTLED US OUT AT THE DOORWAYTO ASK HERBERT WHAT HE THOUGHT
OF HAVING HIM HOME TO SUPPER HERBERT SAID HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE KIND
TO DO SO THEREFORE I INVITED HIM AND HE WENT TO BARNARDS WITH US
WRAPPED UP TO THE EYES AND WE DID OUR BEST FOR HIM AND HE SAT UNTIL
TWO OCLOCK IN THE MORNING REVIEWING HIS SUCCESS AND DEVELOPING HIS
PLANS I FORGET IN DETAIL WHAT THEY WERE BUT I HAVE A GENERAL
RECOLLECTION THAT HE WAS TO BEGIN WITH REVIVING THE DRAMA AND TO END
WITH CRUSHING IT INASMUCH AS HIS DECEASE WOULD LEAVE IT UTTERLY BEREFT
AND WITHOUT A CHANCE OR HOPE

MISERABLY I WENT TO BED AFTER ALL AND MISERABLY THOUGHT OF ESTELLA
AND MISERABLY DREAMED THAT MY EXPECTATIONS WERE ALL CANCELLED AND THAT
I HAD TO GIVE MY HAND IN MARRIAGE TO HERBERTS CLARA OR PLAY HAMLET TO
MISS HAVISHAMS GHOST BEFORE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT KNOWING
TWENTY WORDS OF IT




CHAPTER XXXII


ONE DAY WHEN I WAS BUSY WITH MY BOOKS AND MR POCKET I RECEIVED A NOTE
BY THE POST THE MERE OUTSIDE OF WHICH THREW ME INTO A GREAT FLUTTER
FOR THOUGH I HAD NEVER SEEN THE HANDWRITING IN WHICH IT WAS ADDRESSED
I DIVINED WHOSE HAND IT WAS IT HAD NO SET BEGINNING AS DEAR MR PIP
OR DEAR PIP OR DEAR SIR OR DEAR ANYTHING BUT RAN THUS

I AM TO COME TO LONDON THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW BY THE MIDDAY COACH I
BELIEVE IT WAS SETTLED YOU SHOULD MEET ME AT ALL EVENTS MISS HAVISHAM
HAS THAT IMPRESSION AND I WRITE IN OBEDIENCE TO IT SHE SENDS YOU HER
REGARD


YOURS ESTELLA


IF THERE HAD BEEN TIME I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL SUITS OF
CLOTHES FOR THIS OCCASION BUT AS THERE WAS NOT I WAS FAIN TO BE
CONTENT WITH THOSE I HAD MY APPETITE VANISHED INSTANTLY AND I KNEW NO
PEACE OR REST UNTIL THE DAY ARRIVED NOT THAT ITS ARRIVAL BROUGHT ME
EITHER FOR THEN I WAS WORSE THAN EVER AND BEGAN HAUNTING THE
COACHOFFICE IN WOOD STREET CHEAPSIDE BEFORE THE COACH HAD LEFT THE
BLUE BOAR IN OUR TOWN FOR ALL THAT I KNEW THIS PERFECTLY WELL I STILL
FELT AS IF IT WERE NOT SAFE TO LET THE COACHOFFICE BE OUT OF MY SIGHT
LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME AND IN THIS CONDITION OF UNREASON I
HAD PERFORMED THE FIRST HALFHOUR OF A WATCH OF FOUR OR FIVE HOURS
WHEN WEMMICK RAN AGAINST ME

HALLOA MR PIP SAID HE HOW DO YOU DO I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE
THOUGHT THIS WAS YOUR BEAT

I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS WAITING TO MEET SOMEBODY WHO WAS COMING UP BY
COACH AND I INQUIRED AFTER THE CASTLE AND THE AGED

BOTH FLOURISHING THANKYE SAID WEMMICK AND PARTICULARLY THE AGED
HES IN WONDERFUL FEATHER HELL BE EIGHTYTWO NEXT BIRTHDAY I HAVE A
NOTION OF FIRING EIGHTYTWO TIMES IF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SHOULDNT
COMPLAIN AND THAT CANNON OF MINE SHOULD PROVE EQUAL TO THE PRESSURE
HOWEVER THIS IS NOT LONDON TALK WHERE DO YOU THINK I AM GOING TO

TO THE OFFICE SAID I FOR HE WAS TENDING IN THAT DIRECTION

NEXT THING TO IT RETURNED WEMMICK I AM GOING TO NEWGATE WE ARE IN
A BANKERSPARCEL CASE JUST AT PRESENT AND I HAVE BEEN DOWN THE ROAD
TAKING A SQUINT AT THE SCENE OF ACTION AND THEREUPON MUST HAVE A WORD
OR TWO WITH OUR CLIENT

DID YOUR CLIENT COMMIT THE ROBBERY I ASKED

BLESS YOUR SOUL AND BODY NO ANSWERED WEMMICK VERY DRILY BUT HE
IS ACCUSED OF IT SO MIGHT YOU OR I BE EITHER OF US MIGHT BE ACCUSED
OF IT YOU KNOW

ONLY NEITHER OF US IS I REMARKED

YAH SAID WEMMICK TOUCHING ME ON THE BREAST WITH HIS FOREFINGER
YOURE A DEEP ONE MR PIP WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK AT NEWGATE
HAVE YOU TIME TO SPARE

I HAD SO MUCH TIME TO SPARE THAT THE PROPOSAL CAME AS A RELIEF
NOTWITHSTANDING ITS IRRECONCILABILITY WITH MY LATENT DESIRE TO KEEP MY
EYE ON THE COACHOFFICE MUTTERING THAT I WOULD MAKE THE INQUIRY
WHETHER I HAD TIME TO WALK WITH HIM I WENT INTO THE OFFICE AND
ASCERTAINED FROM THE CLERK WITH THE NICEST PRECISION AND MUCH TO THE
TRYING OF HIS TEMPER THE EARLIEST MOMENT AT WHICH THE COACH COULD BE
EXPECTEDWHICH I KNEW BEFOREHAND QUITE AS WELL AS HE I THEN REJOINED
MR WEMMICK AND AFFECTING TO CONSULT MY WATCH AND TO BE SURPRISED BY
THE INFORMATION I HAD RECEIVED ACCEPTED HIS OFFER

WE WERE AT NEWGATE IN A FEW MINUTES AND WE PASSED THROUGH THE LODGE
WHERE SOME FETTERS WERE HANGING UP ON THE BARE WALLS AMONG THE PRISON
RULES INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE JAIL AT THAT TIME JAILS WERE MUCH
NEGLECTED AND THE PERIOD OF EXAGGERATED REACTION CONSEQUENT ON ALL
PUBLIC WRONGDOINGAND WHICH IS ALWAYS ITS HEAVIEST AND LONGEST
PUNISHMENTWAS STILL FAR OFF SO FELONS WERE NOT LODGED AND FED BETTER
THAN SOLDIERS TO SAY NOTHING OF PAUPERS AND SELDOM SET FIRE TO THEIR
PRISONS WITH THE EXCUSABLE OBJECT OF IMPROVING THE FLAVOUR OF THEIR
SOUP IT WAS VISITING TIME WHEN WEMMICK TOOK ME IN AND A POTMAN WAS
GOING HIS ROUNDS WITH BEER AND THE PRISONERS BEHIND BARS IN YARDS
WERE BUYING BEER AND TALKING TO FRIENDS AND A FROWZY UGLY
DISORDERLY DEPRESSING SCENE IT WAS

IT STRUCK ME THAT WEMMICK WALKED AMONG THE PRISONERS MUCH AS A GARDENER
MIGHT WALK AMONG HIS PLANTS THIS WAS FIRST PUT INTO MY HEAD BY HIS
SEEING A SHOOT THAT HAD COME UP IN THE NIGHT AND SAYING WHAT
CAPTAIN TOM ARE YOU THERE AH INDEED AND ALSO IS THAT BLACK
BILL BEHIND THE CISTERN WHY I DIDNT LOOK FOR YOU THESE TWO MONTHS
HOW DO YOU FIND YOURSELF EQUALLY IN HIS STOPPING AT THE BARS AND
ATTENDING TO ANXIOUS WHISPERERSALWAYS SINGLYWEMMICK WITH HIS
POSTOFFICE IN AN IMMOVABLE STATE LOOKED AT THEM WHILE IN CONFERENCE
AS IF HE WERE TAKING PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE ADVANCE THEY HAD MADE
SINCE LAST OBSERVED TOWARDS COMING OUT IN FULL BLOW AT THEIR TRIAL

HE WAS HIGHLY POPULAR AND I FOUND THAT HE TOOK THE FAMILIAR DEPARTMENT
OF MR JAGGERSS BUSINESS THOUGH SOMETHING OF THE STATE OF MR JAGGERS
HUNG ABOUT HIM TOO FORBIDDING APPROACH BEYOND CERTAIN LIMITS HIS
PERSONAL RECOGNITION OF EACH SUCCESSIVE CLIENT WAS COMPRISED IN A NOD
AND IN HIS SETTLING HIS HAT A LITTLE EASIER ON HIS HEAD WITH BOTH
HANDS AND THEN TIGHTENING THE POSTOFFICE AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN
HIS POCKETS IN ONE OR TWO INSTANCES THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY RESPECTING
THE RAISING OF FEES AND THEN MR WEMMICK BACKING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
FROM THE INSUFFICIENT MONEY PRODUCED SAID ITS NO USE MY BOY IM
ONLY A SUBORDINATE I CANT TAKE IT DONT GO ON IN THAT WAY WITH A
SUBORDINATE IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO MAKE UP YOUR QUANTUM MY BOY YOU HAD
BETTER ADDRESS YOURSELF TO A PRINCIPAL THERE ARE PLENTY OF PRINCIPALS
IN THE PROFESSION YOU KNOW AND WHAT IS NOT WORTH THE WHILE OF ONE
MAY BE WORTH THE WHILE OF ANOTHER THATS MY RECOMMENDATION TO YOU
SPEAKING AS A SUBORDINATE DONT TRY ON USELESS MEASURES WHY SHOULD
YOU NOW WHOS NEXT

THUS WE WALKED THROUGH WEMMICKS GREENHOUSE UNTIL HE TURNED TO ME AND
SAID NOTICE THE MAN I SHALL SHAKE HANDS WITH I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO
WITHOUT THE PREPARATION AS HE HAD SHAKEN HANDS WITH NO ONE YET

ALMOST AS SOON AS HE HAD SPOKEN A PORTLY UPRIGHT MAN WHOM I CAN SEE
NOW AS I WRITE IN A WELLWORN OLIVECOLOURED FROCKCOAT WITH A
PECULIAR PALLOR OVERSPREADING THE RED IN HIS COMPLEXION AND EYES THAT
WENT WANDERING ABOUT WHEN HE TRIED TO FIX THEM CAME UP TO A CORNER OF
THE BARS AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS HATWHICH HAD A GREASY AND FATTY
SURFACE LIKE COLD BROTHWITH A HALFSERIOUS AND HALFJOCOSE MILITARY

ME SERVED HIS MAJESTY THIS MAN WAS A SOLDIER IN THE LINE AND BOUGHT
HIS DISCHARGE

MY HEAD AND THEN LOOKED ALL ROUND ME AND THEN HE DREW HIS HAND ACROSS
HIS LIPS AND LAUGHED

I THINK I SHALL BE OUT OF THIS ON MONDAY SIR HE SAID TO WEMMICK

PERHAPS RETURNED MY FRIEND BUT THERES NO KNOWING

THANKYE SAID WEMMICK SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM SAME TO YOU
COLONEL

MAN UNWILLING TO LET HIS HAND GO I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THE FAVOUR OF

MONDAY STILL YOU SEE AS FAR AS IT GOES A PAIR OF PIGEONS ARE
PORTABLE PROPERTY ALL THE SAME WITH THAT HE LOOKED BACK AND NODDED
AT THIS DEAD PLANT AND THEN CAST HIS EYES ABOUT HIM IN WALKING OUT OF
THE YARD AS IF HE WERE CONSIDERING WHAT OTHER POT WOULD GO BEST IN ITS
PLACE

AS WE CAME OUT OF THE PRISON THROUGH THE LODGE I FOUND THAT THE GREAT
IMPORTANCE OF MY GUARDIAN WAS APPRECIATED BY THE TURNKEYS NO LESS THAN
BY THOSE WHOM THEY HELD IN CHARGE WELL MR WEMMICK SAID THE
TURNKEY WHO KEPT US BETWEEN THE TWO STUDDED AND SPIKED LODGE GATES
AND WHO CAREFULLY LOCKED ONE BEFORE HE UNLOCKED THE OTHER WHATS MR
JAGGERS GOING TO DO WITH THAT WATERSIDE MURDER IS HE GOING TO MAKE IT
MANSLAUGHTER OR WHATS HE GOING TO MAKE OF IT

WHY DONT YOU ASK HIM RETURNED WEMMICK

O YES I DARE SAY SAID THE TURNKEY

NOW THATS THE WAY WITH THEM HERE MR PIP REMARKED WEMMICK
TURNING TO ME WITH HIS POSTOFFICE ELONGATED THEY DONT MIND WHAT
THEY ASK OF ME THE SUBORDINATE BUT YOULL NEVER CATCH EM ASKING ANY
QUESTIONS OF MY PRINCIPAL

IS THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF THE PRENTICES OR ARTICLED ONES OF YOUR
OFFICE ASKED THE TURNKEY WITH A GRIN AT MR WEMMICKS HUMOUR

THERE HE GOES AGAIN YOU SEE CRIED WEMMICK I TOLD YOU SO ASKS
ANOTHER QUESTION OF THE SUBORDINATE BEFORE HIS FIRST IS DRY WELL

FACETIOUS WAY YOURE DUMB AS ONE OF YOUR OWN KEYS WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO
WITH MY PRINCIPAL YOU KNOW YOU ARE LET US OUT YOU OLD FOX OR ILL
GET HIM TO BRING AN ACTION AGAINST YOU FOR FALSE IMPRISONMENT

THE TURNKEY LAUGHED AND GAVE US GOOD DAY AND STOOD LAUGHING AT US
OVER THE SPIKES OF THE WICKET WHEN WE DESCENDED THE STEPS INTO THE
STREET

MIND YOU MR PIP SAID WEMMICK GRAVELY IN MY EAR AS HE TOOK MY ARM
TO BE MORE CONFIDENTIAL I DONT KNOW THAT MR JAGGERS DOES A BETTER
THING THAN THE WAY IN WHICH HE KEEPS HIMSELF SO HIGH HES ALWAYS SO
HIGH HIS CONSTANT HEIGHT IS OF A PIECE WITH HIS IMMENSE ABILITIES
THAT COLONEL DURST NO MORE TAKE LEAVE OF HIM THAN THAT TURNKEY DURST
ASK HIM HIS INTENTIONS RESPECTING A CASE THEN BETWEEN HIS HEIGHT AND
THEM HE SLIPS IN HIS SUBORDINATEDONT YOU SEEAND SO HE HAS EM
SOUL AND BODY

I WAS VERY MUCH IMPRESSED AND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME BY MY GUARDIANS
SUBTLETY TO CONFESS THE TRUTH I VERY HEARTILY WISHED AND NOT FOR THE
FIRST TIME THAT I HAD HAD SOME OTHER GUARDIAN OF MINOR ABILITIES

MR WEMMICK AND I PARTED AT THE OFFICE IN LITTLE BRITAIN WHERE
SUPPLIANTS FOR MR JAGGERSS NOTICE WERE LINGERING ABOUT AS USUAL AND
I RETURNED TO MY WATCH IN THE STREET OF THE COACHOFFICE WITH SOME
THREE HOURS ON HAND I CONSUMED THE WHOLE TIME IN THINKING HOW STRANGE
IT WAS THAT I SHOULD BE ENCOMPASSED BY ALL THIS TAINT OF PRISON AND
CRIME THAT IN MY CHILDHOOD OUT ON OUR LONELY MARSHES ON A WINTER
EVENING I SHOULD HAVE FIRST ENCOUNTERED IT THAT IT SHOULD HAVE
REAPPEARED ON TWO OCCASIONS STARTING OUT LIKE A STAIN THAT WAS FADED
BUT NOT GONE THAT IT SHOULD IN THIS NEW WAY PERVADE MY FORTUNE AND
ADVANCEMENT WHILE MY MIND WAS THUS ENGAGED I THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG ESTELLA PROUD AND REFINED COMING TOWARDS ME AND I THOUGHT WITH
ABSOLUTE ABHORRENCE OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE JAIL AND HER I WISHED
THAT WEMMICK HAD NOT MET ME OR THAT I HAD NOT YIELDED TO HIM AND GONE
WITH HIM SO THAT OF ALL DAYS IN THE YEAR ON THIS DAY I MIGHT NOT
HAVE HAD NEWGATE IN MY BREATH AND ON MY CLOTHES I BEAT THE PRISON DUST
OFF MY FEET AS I SAUNTERED TO AND FRO AND I SHOOK IT OUT OF MY DRESS
AND I EXHALED ITS AIR FROM MY LUNGS SO CONTAMINATED DID I FEEL
REMEMBERING WHO WAS COMING THAT THE COACH CAME QUICKLY AFTER ALL AND
I WAS NOT YET FREE FROM THE SOILING CONSCIOUSNESS OF MR WEMMICKS
CONSERVATORY WHEN I SAW HER FACE AT THE COACH WINDOW AND HER HAND
WAVING TO ME

WHAT WAS THE NAMELESS SHADOW WHICH AGAIN IN THAT ONE INSTANT HAD
PASSED




CHAPTER XXXIII


IN HER FURRED TRAVELLINGDRESS ESTELLA SEEMED MORE DELICATELY
BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEMED YET EVEN IN MY EYES HER MANNER WAS
MORE WINNING THAN SHE HAD CARED TO LET IT BE TO ME BEFORE AND I
THOUGHT I SAW MISS HAVISHAMS INFLUENCE IN THE CHANGE

WE STOOD IN THE INN YARD WHILE SHE POINTED OUT HER LUGGAGE TO ME AND
WHEN IT WAS ALL COLLECTED I REMEMBEREDHAVING FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING BUT
HERSELF IN THE MEANWHILETHAT I KNEW NOTHING OF HER DESTINATION

I AM GOING TO RICHMOND SHE TOLD ME OUR LESSON IS THAT THERE ARE
TWO RICHMONDS ONE IN SURREY AND ONE IN YORKSHIRE AND THAT MINE IS THE
SURREY RICHMOND THE DISTANCE IS TEN MILES I AM TO HAVE A CARRIAGE
AND YOU ARE TO TAKE ME THIS IS MY PURSE AND YOU ARE TO PAY MY CHARGES
OUT OF IT O YOU MUST TAKE THE PURSE WE HAVE NO CHOICE YOU AND I
BUT TO OBEY OUR INSTRUCTIONS WE ARE NOT FREE TO FOLLOW OUR OWN
DEVICES YOU AND I

AS SHE LOOKED AT ME IN GIVING ME THE PURSE I HOPED THERE WAS AN INNER
MEANING IN HER WORDS SHE SAID THEM SLIGHTINGLY BUT NOT WITH
DISPLEASURE

A CARRIAGE WILL HAVE TO BE SENT FOR ESTELLA WILL YOU REST HERE A
LITTLE

YES I AM TO REST HERE A LITTLE AND I AM TO DRINK SOME TEA AND YOU
ARE TO TAKE CARE OF ME THE WHILE

SHE DREW HER ARM THROUGH MINE AS IF IT MUST BE DONE AND I REQUESTED A
WAITER WHO HAD BEEN STARING AT THE COACH LIKE A MAN WHO HAD NEVER SEEN
SUCH A THING IN HIS LIFE TO SHOW US A PRIVATE SITTINGROOM UPON THAT
HE PULLED OUT A NAPKIN AS IF IT WERE A MAGIC CLUE WITHOUT WHICH HE
COULDNT FIND THE WAY UPSTAIRS AND LED US TO THE BLACK HOLE OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT FITTED UP WITH A DIMINISHING MIRROR QUITE A SUPERFLUOUS
ARTICLE CONSIDERING THE HOLES PROPORTIONS AN ANCHOVY SAUCECRUET
AND SOMEBODYS PATTENS ON MY OBJECTING TO THIS RETREAT HE TOOK US
INTO ANOTHER ROOM WITH A DINNERTABLE FOR THIRTY AND IN THE GRATE A
SCORCHED LEAF OF A COPYBOOK UNDER A BUSHEL OF COALDUST HAVING LOOKED
AT THIS EXTINCT CONFLAGRATION AND SHAKEN HIS HEAD HE TOOK MY ORDER
WHICH PROVING TO BE MERELY SOME TEA FOR THE LADY SENT HIM OUT OF
THE ROOM IN A VERY LOW STATE OF MIND

I WAS AND I AM SENSIBLE THAT THE AIR OF THIS CHAMBER IN ITS STRONG
COMBINATION OF STABLE WITH SOUPSTOCK MIGHT HAVE LED ONE TO INFER THAT
THE COACHING DEPARTMENT WAS NOT DOING WELL AND THAT THE ENTERPRISING
PROPRIETOR WAS BOILING DOWN THE HORSES FOR THE REFRESHMENT DEPARTMENT
YET THE ROOM WAS ALL IN ALL TO ME ESTELLA BEING IN IT I THOUGHT THAT
WITH HER I COULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY THERE FOR LIFE I WAS NOT AT ALL
HAPPY THERE AT THE TIME OBSERVE AND I KNEW IT WELL

WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO AT RICHMOND I ASKED ESTELLA

I AM GOING TO LIVE SAID SHE AT A GREAT EXPENSE WITH A LADY THERE
WHO HAS THE POWEROR SAYS SHE HASOF TAKING ME ABOUT AND INTRODUCING
ME AND SHOWING PEOPLE TO ME AND SHOWING ME TO PEOPLE

I SUPPOSE YOU WILL BE GLAD OF VARIETY AND ADMIRATION

YES I SUPPOSE SO

SHE ANSWERED SO CARELESSLY THAT I SAID YOU SPEAK OF YOURSELF AS IF
YOU WERE SOME ONE ELSE

WHERE DID YOU LEARN HOW I SPEAK OF OTHERS COME COME SAID ESTELLA
SMILING DELIGHTFULLY YOU MUST NOT EXPECT ME TO GO TO SCHOOL TO YOU
I MUST TALK IN MY OWN WAY HOW DO YOU THRIVE WITH MR POCKET

I LIVE QUITE PLEASANTLY THERE AT LEAST IT APPEARED TO ME THAT I WAS
LOSING A CHANCE

AT LEAST REPEATED ESTELLA

AS PLEASANTLY AS I COULD ANYWHERE AWAY FROM YOU

YOU SILLY BOY SAID ESTELLA QUITE COMPOSEDLY HOW CAN YOU TALK SUCH
NONSENSE YOUR FRIEND MR MATTHEW I BELIEVE IS SUPERIOR TO THE REST
OF HIS FAMILY

VERY SUPERIOR INDEED HE IS NOBODYS ENEMY

DONT ADD BUT HIS OWN INTERPOSED ESTELLA FOR I HATE THAT CLASS OF
MAN BUT HE REALLY IS DISINTERESTED AND ABOVE SMALL JEALOUSY AND
SPITE I HAVE HEARD

I AM SURE I HAVE EVERY REASON TO SAY SO

YOU HAVE NOT EVERY REASON TO SAY SO OF THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE SAID
ESTELLA NODDING AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF FACE THAT WAS AT ONCE
GRAVE AND RALLYING FOR THEY BESET MISS HAVISHAM WITH REPORTS AND
INSINUATIONS TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE THEY WATCH YOU MISREPRESENT YOU
WRITE LETTERS ABOUT YOU ANONYMOUS SOMETIMES AND YOU ARE THE TORMENT
AND THE OCCUPATION OF THEIR LIVES YOU CAN SCARCELY REALISE TO YOURSELF
THE HATRED THOSE PEOPLE FEEL FOR YOU

THEY DO ME NO HARM I HOPE

INSTEAD OF ANSWERING ESTELLA BURST OUT LAUGHING THIS WAS VERY
SINGULAR TO ME AND I LOOKED AT HER IN CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY WHEN
SHE LEFT OFFAND SHE HAD NOT LAUGHED LANGUIDLY BUT WITH REAL
ENJOYMENTI SAID IN MY DIFFIDENT WAY WITH HER

I HOPE I MAY SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE AMUSED IF THEY DID ME ANY
HARM

NO NO YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID ESTELLA YOU MAY BE CERTAIN
THAT I LAUGH BECAUSE THEY FAIL O THOSE PEOPLE WITH MISS HAVISHAM AND
THE TORTURES THEY UNDERGO SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND EVEN NOW WHEN SHE
HAD TOLD ME WHY HER LAUGHTER WAS VERY SINGULAR TO ME FOR I COULD NOT
DOUBT ITS BEING GENUINE AND YET IT SEEMED TOO MUCH FOR THE OCCASION I
THOUGHT THERE MUST REALLY BE SOMETHING MORE HERE THAN I KNEW SHE SAW
THE THOUGHT IN MY MIND AND ANSWERED IT

IT IS NOT EASY FOR EVEN YOU SAID ESTELLA TO KNOW WHAT SATISFACTION
IT GIVES ME TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE THWARTED OR WHAT AN ENJOYABLE SENSE OF
THE RIDICULOUS I HAVE WHEN THEY ARE MADE RIDICULOUS FOR YOU WERE NOT
BROUGHT UP IN THAT STRANGE HOUSE FROM A MERE BABY I WAS YOU HAD NOT
YOUR LITTLE WITS SHARPENED BY THEIR INTRIGUING AGAINST YOU SUPPRESSED
AND DEFENCELESS UNDER THE MASK OF SYMPATHY AND PITY AND WHAT NOT THAT
IS SOFT AND SOOTHING I HAD YOU DID NOT GRADUALLY OPEN YOUR ROUND
CHILDISH EYES WIDER AND WIDER TO THE DISCOVERY OF THAT IMPOSTOR OF A
WOMAN WHO CALCULATES HER STORES OF PEACE OF MIND FOR WHEN SHE WAKES UP
IN THE NIGHT I DID

IT WAS NO LAUGHING MATTER WITH ESTELLA NOW NOR WAS SHE SUMMONING THESE
REMEMBRANCES FROM ANY SHALLOW PLACE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF
THAT LOOK OF HERS FOR ALL MY EXPECTATIONS IN A HEAP

TWO THINGS I CAN TELL YOU SAID ESTELLA FIRST NOTWITHSTANDING THE
PROVERB THAT CONSTANT DROPPING WILL WEAR AWAY A STONE YOU MAY SET YOUR
MIND AT REST THAT THESE PEOPLE NEVER WILLNEVER WOULD IN A HUNDRED
YEARSIMPAIR YOUR GROUND WITH MISS HAVISHAM IN ANY PARTICULAR GREAT
OR SMALL SECOND I AM BEHOLDEN TO YOU AS THE CAUSE OF THEIR BEING SO
BUSY AND SO MEAN IN VAIN AND THERE IS MY HAND UPON IT

AS SHE GAVE IT TO ME PLAYFULLYFOR HER DARKER MOOD HAD BEEN BUT
MOMENTARYI HELD IT AND PUT IT TO MY LIPS YOU RIDICULOUS BOY SAID
ESTELLA WILL YOU NEVER TAKE WARNING OR DO YOU KISS MY HAND IN THE
SAME SPIRIT IN WHICH I ONCE LET YOU KISS MY CHEEK

WHAT SPIRIT WAS THAT SAID I

I MUST THINK A MOMENT A SPIRIT OF CONTEMPT FOR THE FAWNERS AND
PLOTTERS

IF I SAY YES MAY I KISS THE CHEEK AGAIN

YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED BEFORE YOU TOUCHED THE HAND BUT YES IF YOU
LIKE

I LEANED DOWN AND HER CALM FACE WAS LIKE A STATUES NOW SAID
ESTELLA GLIDING AWAY THE INSTANT I TOUCHED HER CHEEK YOU ARE TO TAKE
CARE THAT I HAVE SOME TEA AND YOU ARE TO TAKE ME TO RICHMOND

HER REVERTING TO THIS TONE AS IF OUR ASSOCIATION WERE FORCED UPON US
AND WE WERE MERE PUPPETS GAVE ME PAIN BUT EVERYTHING IN OUR
INTERCOURSE DID GIVE ME PAIN WHATEVER HER TONE WITH ME HAPPENED TO BE
I COULD PUT NO TRUST IN IT AND BUILD NO HOPE ON IT AND YET I WENT ON
AGAINST TRUST AND AGAINST HOPE WHY REPEAT IT A THOUSAND TIMES SO IT
ALWAYS WAS

I RANG FOR THE TEA AND THE WAITER REAPPEARING WITH HIS MAGIC CLUE
BROUGHT IN BY DEGREES SOME FIFTY ADJUNCTS TO THAT REFRESHMENT BUT OF
TEA NOT A GLIMPSE A TEABOARD CUPS AND SAUCERS PLATES KNIVES AND
FORKS INCLUDING CARVERS SPOONS VARIOUS SALTCELLARS A MEEK
LITTLE MUFFIN CONFINED WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION UNDER A STRONG IRON
COVER MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES TYPIFIED BY A SOFT BIT OF BUTTER IN A
QUANTITY OF PARSLEY A PALE LOAF WITH A POWDERED HEAD TWO PROOF
IMPRESSIONS OF THE BARS OF THE KITCHEN FIREPLACE ON TRIANGULAR BITS OF
BREAD AND ULTIMATELY A FAT FAMILY URN WHICH THE WAITER STAGGERED IN
WITH EXPRESSING IN HIS COUNTENANCE BURDEN AND SUFFERING AFTER A
PROLONGED ABSENCE AT THIS STAGE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT HE AT LENGTH CAME
BACK WITH A CASKET OF PRECIOUS APPEARANCE CONTAINING TWIGS THESE I
STEEPED IN HOT WATER AND SO FROM THE WHOLE OF THESE APPLIANCES
EXTRACTED ONE CUP OF I DONT KNOW WHAT FOR ESTELLA

THE BILL PAID AND THE WAITER REMEMBERED AND THE OSTLER NOT FORGOTTEN
AND THE CHAMBERMAID TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATIONIN A WORD THE WHOLE
HOUSE BRIBED INTO A STATE OF CONTEMPT AND ANIMOSITY AND ESTELLAS
PURSE MUCH LIGHTENEDWE GOT INTO OUR POSTCOACH AND DROVE AWAY
TURNING INTO CHEAPSIDE AND RATTLING UP NEWGATE STREET WE WERE SOON
UNDER THE WALLS OF WHICH I WAS SO ASHAMED

WHAT PLACE IS THAT ESTELLA ASKED ME

I MADE A FOOLISH PRETENCE OF NOT AT FIRST RECOGNISING IT AND THEN TOLD
HER AS SHE LOOKED AT IT AND DREW IN HER HEAD AGAIN MURMURING
WRETCHES I WOULD NOT HAVE CONFESSED TO MY VISIT FOR ANY
CONSIDERATION

MR JAGGERS SAID I BY WAY OF PUTTING IT NEATLY ON SOMEBODY ELSE
HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING MORE IN THE SECRETS OF THAT DISMAL PLACE
THAN ANY MAN IN LONDON

HE IS MORE IN THE SECRETS OF EVERY PLACE I THINK SAID ESTELLA IN A
LOW VOICE

YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM OFTEN I SUPPOSE

I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM AT UNCERTAIN INTERVALS EVER SINCE I
CAN REMEMBER BUT I KNOW HIM NO BETTER NOW THAN I DID BEFORE I COULD
SPEAK PLAINLY WHAT IS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE OF HIM DO YOU ADVANCE WITH
HIM

ONCE HABITUATED TO HIS DISTRUSTFUL MANNER SAID I I HAVE DONE VERY
WELL

ARE YOU INTIMATE

I HAVE DINED WITH HIM AT HIS PRIVATE HOUSE

I FANCY SAID ESTELLA SHRINKING THAT MUST BE A CURIOUS PLACE

IT IS A CURIOUS PLACE

I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARY OF DISCUSSING MY GUARDIAN TOO FREELY EVEN WITH
HER BUT I SHOULD HAVE GONE ON WITH THE SUBJECT SO FAR AS TO DESCRIBE
THE DINNER IN GERRARD STREET IF WE HAD NOT THEN COME INTO A SUDDEN
GLARE OF GAS IT SEEMED WHILE IT LASTED TO BE ALL ALIGHT AND ALIVE
WITH THAT INEXPLICABLE FEELING I HAD HAD BEFORE AND WHEN WE WERE OUT
OF IT I WAS AS MUCH DAZED FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF I HAD BEEN IN
LIGHTNING

SO WE FELL INTO OTHER TALK AND IT WAS PRINCIPALLY ABOUT THE WAY BY
WHICH WE WERE TRAVELLING AND ABOUT WHAT PARTS OF LONDON LAY ON THIS
SIDE OF IT AND WHAT ON THAT THE GREAT CITY WAS ALMOST NEW TO HER SHE
TOLD ME FOR SHE HAD NEVER LEFT MISS HAVISHAMS NEIGHBOURHOOD UNTIL SHE
HAD GONE TO FRANCE AND SHE HAD MERELY PASSED THROUGH LONDON THEN IN
GOING AND RETURNING I ASKED HER IF MY GUARDIAN HAD ANY CHARGE OF HER
WHILE SHE REMAINED HERE TO THAT SHE EMPHATICALLY SAID GOD FORBID
AND NO MORE

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO AVOID SEEING THAT SHE CARED TO ATTRACT ME
THAT SHE MADE HERSELF WINNING AND WOULD HAVE WON ME EVEN IF THE TASK
HAD NEEDED PAINS YET THIS MADE ME NONE THE HAPPIER FOR EVEN IF SHE
HAD NOT TAKEN THAT TONE OF OUR BEING DISPOSED OF BY OTHERS I SHOULD
HAVE FELT THAT SHE HELD MY HEART IN HER HAND BECAUSE SHE WILFULLY CHOSE
TO DO IT AND NOT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE WRUNG ANY TENDERNESS IN HER TO
CRUSH IT AND THROW IT AWAY

WHEN WE PASSED THROUGH HAMMERSMITH I SHOWED HER WHERE MR MATTHEW
POCKET LIVED AND SAID IT WAS NO GREAT WAY FROM RICHMOND AND THAT I
HOPED I SHOULD SEE HER SOMETIMES

O YES YOU ARE TO SEE ME YOU ARE TO COME WHEN YOU THINK PROPER YOU
ARE TO BE MENTIONED TO THE FAMILY INDEED YOU ARE ALREADY MENTIONED

I INQUIRED WAS IT A LARGE HOUSEHOLD SHE WAS GOING TO BE A MEMBER OF

NO THERE ARE ONLY TWO MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE MOTHER IS A LADY OF
SOME STATION THOUGH NOT AVERSE TO INCREASING HER INCOME

I WONDER MISS HAVISHAM COULD PART WITH YOU AGAIN SO SOON

IT IS A PART OF MISS HAVISHAMS PLANS FOR ME PIP SAID ESTELLA WITH
A SIGH AS IF SHE WERE TIRED I AM TO WRITE TO HER CONSTANTLY AND SEE
HER REGULARLY AND REPORT HOW I GO ONI AND THE JEWELSFOR THEY ARE
NEARLY ALL MINE NOW

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD EVER CALLED ME BY MY NAME OF COURSE SHE
DID SO PURPOSELY AND KNEW THAT I SHOULD TREASURE IT UP

WE CAME TO RICHMOND ALL TOO SOON AND OUR DESTINATION THERE WAS A HOUSE
BY THE GREENA STAID OLD HOUSE WHERE HOOPS AND POWDER AND PATCHES
EMBROIDERED COATS ROLLED STOCKINGS RUFFLES AND SWORDS HAD HAD THEIR
COURT DAYS MANY A TIME SOME ANCIENT TREES BEFORE THE HOUSE WERE STILL
CUT INTO FASHIONS AS FORMAL AND UNNATURAL AS THE HOOPS AND WIGS AND
STIFF SKIRTS BUT THEIR OWN ALLOTTED PLACES IN THE GREAT PROCESSION OF
THE DEAD WERE NOT FAR OFF AND THEY WOULD SOON DROP INTO THEM AND GO
THE SILENT WAY OF THE REST

A BELL WITH AN OLD VOICEWHICH I DARE SAY IN ITS TIME HAD OFTEN SAID TO
THE HOUSE HERE IS THE GREEN FARTHINGALE HERE IS THE DIAMONDHILTED
SWORD HERE ARE THE SHOES WITH RED HEELS AND THE BLUE SOLITAIRESOUNDED
GRAVELY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND TWO CHERRYCOLOURED MAIDS CAME FLUTTERING
OUT TO RECEIVE ESTELLA THE DOORWAY SOON ABSORBED HER BOXES AND SHE
GAVE ME HER HAND AND A SMILE AND SAID GOODNIGHT AND WAS ABSORBED
LIKEWISE AND STILL I STOOD LOOKING AT THE HOUSE THINKING HOW HAPPY I
SHOULD BE IF I LIVED THERE WITH HER AND KNOWING THAT I NEVER WAS HAPPY
WITH HER BUT ALWAYS MISERABLE

I GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE TO BE TAKEN BACK TO HAMMERSMITH AND I GOT IN
WITH A BAD HEARTACHE AND I GOT OUT WITH A WORSE HEARTACHE AT OUR
OWN DOOR I FOUND LITTLE JANE POCKET COMING HOME FROM A LITTLE PARTY
ESCORTED BY HER LITTLE LOVER AND I ENVIED HER LITTLE LOVER IN SPITE
OF HIS BEING SUBJECT TO FLOPSON

MR POCKET WAS OUT LECTURING FOR HE WAS A MOST DELIGHTFUL LECTURER ON
DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND HIS TREATISES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN AND
SERVANTS WERE CONSIDERED THE VERY BEST TEXTBOOKS ON THOSE THEMES BUT
MRS POCKET WAS AT HOME AND WAS IN A LITTLE DIFFICULTY ON ACCOUNT OF
THE BABYS HAVING BEEN ACCOMMODATED WITH A NEEDLECASE TO KEEP HIM
QUIET DURING THE UNACCOUNTABLE ABSENCE WITH A RELATIVE IN THE FOOT
GUARDS OF MILLERS AND MORE NEEDLES WERE MISSING THAN IT COULD BE
REGARDED AS QUITE WHOLESOME FOR A PATIENT OF SUCH TENDER YEARS EITHER
TO APPLY EXTERNALLY OR TO TAKE AS A TONIC

MR POCKET BEING JUSTLY CELEBRATED FOR GIVING MOST EXCELLENT PRACTICAL
ADVICE AND FOR HAVING A CLEAR AND SOUND PERCEPTION OF THINGS AND A
HIGHLY JUDICIOUS MIND I HAD SOME NOTION IN MY HEARTACHE OF BEGGING
HIM TO ACCEPT MY CONFIDENCE BUT HAPPENING TO LOOK UP AT MRS POCKET AS
SHE SAT READING HER BOOK OF DIGNITIES AFTER PRESCRIBING BED AS A
SOVEREIGN REMEDY FOR BABY I THOUGHTWELLNO I WOULDNT




CHAPTER XXXIV


AS I HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO MY EXPECTATIONS I HAD INSENSIBLY BEGUN TO
NOTICE THEIR EFFECT UPON MYSELF AND THOSE AROUND ME THEIR INFLUENCE ON
MY OWN CHARACTER I DISGUISED FROM MY RECOGNITION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT IT WAS NOT ALL GOOD I LIVED IN A STATE OF
CHRONIC UNEASINESS RESPECTING MY BEHAVIOUR TO JOE MY CONSCIENCE WAS
NOT BY ANY MEANS COMFORTABLE ABOUT BIDDY WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE
NIGHTLIKE CAMILLAI USED TO THINK WITH A WEARINESS ON MY SPIRITS
THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER AND BETTER IF I HAD NEVER SEEN MISS
HAVISHAMS FACE AND HAD RISEN TO MANHOOD CONTENT TO BE PARTNERS WITH
JOE IN THE HONEST OLD FORGE MANY A TIME OF AN EVENING WHEN I SAT
ALONE LOOKING AT THE FIRE I THOUGHT AFTER ALL THERE WAS NO FIRE LIKE
THE FORGE FIRE AND THE KITCHEN FIRE AT HOME

YET ESTELLA WAS SO INSEPARABLE FROM ALL MY RESTLESSNESS AND DISQUIET OF
MIND THAT I REALLY FELL INTO CONFUSION AS TO THE LIMITS OF MY OWN PART
IN ITS PRODUCTION THAT IS TO SAY SUPPOSING I HAD HAD NO EXPECTATIONS
AND YET HAD HAD ESTELLA TO THINK OF I COULD NOT MAKE OUT TO MY
SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER NOW CONCERNING THE
INFLUENCE OF MY POSITION ON OTHERS I WAS IN NO SUCH DIFFICULTY AND SO
I PERCEIVEDTHOUGH DIMLY ENOUGH PERHAPSTHAT IT WAS NOT BENEFICIAL TO
ANYBODY AND ABOVE ALL THAT IT WAS NOT BENEFICIAL TO HERBERT MY
LAVISH HABITS LED HIS EASY NATURE INTO EXPENSES THAT HE COULD NOT
AFFORD CORRUPTED THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS LIFE AND DISTURBED HIS PEACE
WITH ANXIETIES AND REGRETS I WAS NOT AT ALL REMORSEFUL FOR HAVING
UNWITTINGLY SET THOSE OTHER BRANCHES OF THE POCKET FAMILY TO THE POOR
ARTS THEY PRACTISED BECAUSE SUCH LITTLENESSES WERE THEIR NATURAL BENT
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN EVOKED BY ANYBODY ELSE IF I HAD LEFT THEM
SLUMBERING BUT HERBERTS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT CASE AND IT OFTEN
CAUSED ME A TWINGE TO THINK THAT I HAD DONE HIM EVIL SERVICE IN
CROWDING HIS SPARELY FURNISHED CHAMBERS WITH INCONGRUOUS UPHOLSTERY
WORK AND PLACING THE CANARYBREASTED AVENGER AT HIS DISPOSAL

SO NOW AS AN INFALLIBLE WAY OF MAKING LITTLE EASE GREAT EASE I BEGAN
TO CONTRACT A QUANTITY OF DEBT I COULD HARDLY BEGIN BUT HERBERT MUST
BEGIN TOO SO HE SOON FOLLOWED AT STARTOPS SUGGESTION WE PUT
OURSELVES DOWN FOR ELECTION INTO A CLUB CALLED THE FINCHES OF THE
GROVE THE OBJECT OF WHICH INSTITUTION I HAVE NEVER DIVINED IF IT WERE
NOT THAT THE MEMBERS SHOULD DINE EXPENSIVELY ONCE A FORTNIGHT TO
QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AFTER DINNER AND TO CAUSE
SIX WAITERS TO GET DRUNK ON THE STAIRS I KNOW THAT THESE GRATIFYING
SOCIAL ENDS WERE SO INVARIABLY ACCOMPLISHED THAT HERBERT AND I
UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ELSE TO BE REFERRED TO IN THE FIRST STANDING TOAST
OF THE SOCIETY WHICH RAN GENTLEMEN MAY THE PRESENT PROMOTION OF GOOD
FEELING EVER REIGN PREDOMINANT AMONG THE FINCHES OF THE GROVE

THE FINCHES SPENT THEIR MONEY FOOLISHLY THE HOTEL WE DINED AT WAS IN
COVENT GARDEN AND THE FIRST FINCH I SAW WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF
JOINING THE GROVE WAS BENTLEY DRUMMLE AT THAT TIME FLOUNDERING ABOUT
TOWN IN A CAB OF HIS OWN AND DOING A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE TO THE POSTS
AT THE STREET CORNERS OCCASIONALLY HE SHOT HIMSELF OUT OF HIS
EQUIPAGE HEADFOREMOST OVER THE APRON AND I SAW HIM ON ONE OCCASION
DELIVER HIMSELF AT THE DOOR OF THE GROVE IN THIS UNINTENTIONAL WAYLIKE
COALS BUT HERE I ANTICIPATE A LITTLE FOR I WAS NOT A FINCH AND COULD
NOT BE ACCORDING TO THE SACRED LAWS OF THE SOCIETY UNTIL I CAME OF
AGE

IN MY CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN RESOURCES I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE TAKEN
HERBERTS EXPENSES ON MYSELF BUT HERBERT WAS PROUD AND I COULD MAKE
NO SUCH PROPOSAL TO HIM SO HE GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES IN EVERY
DIRECTION AND CONTINUED TO LOOK ABOUT HIM WHEN WE GRADUALLY FELL INTO
KEEPING LATE HOURS AND LATE COMPANY I NOTICED THAT HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
WITH A DESPONDING EYE AT BREAKFASTTIME THAT HE BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT
HIM MORE HOPEFULLY ABOUT MIDDAY THAT HE DROOPED WHEN HE CAME INTO
DINNER THAT HE SEEMED TO DESCRY CAPITAL IN THE DISTANCE RATHER
CLEARLY AFTER DINNER THAT HE ALL BUT REALISED CAPITAL TOWARDS
MIDNIGHT AND THAT AT ABOUT TWO OCLOCK IN THE MORNING HE BECAME SO
DEEPLY DESPONDENT AGAIN AS TO TALK OF BUYING A RIFLE AND GOING TO
AMERICA WITH A GENERAL PURPOSE OF COMPELLING BUFFALOES TO MAKE HIS
FORTUNE

I WAS USUALLY AT HAMMERSMITH ABOUT HALF THE WEEK AND WHEN I WAS AT
HAMMERSMITH I HAUNTED RICHMOND WHEREOF SEPARATELY BY AND BY HERBERT
WOULD OFTEN COME TO HAMMERSMITH WHEN I WAS THERE AND I THINK AT THOSE
SEASONS HIS FATHER WOULD OCCASIONALLY HAVE SOME PASSING PERCEPTION THAT
THE OPENING HE WAS LOOKING FOR HAD NOT APPEARED YET BUT IN THE
GENERAL TUMBLING UP OF THE FAMILY HIS TUMBLING OUT IN LIFE SOMEWHERE
WAS A THING TO TRANSACT ITSELF SOMEHOW IN THE MEANTIME MR POCKET GREW
GREYER AND TRIED OFTENER TO LIFT HIMSELF OUT OF HIS PERPLEXITIES BY
THE HAIR WHILE MRS POCKET TRIPPED UP THE FAMILY WITH HER FOOTSTOOL
READ HER BOOK OF DIGNITIES LOST HER POCKETHANDKERCHIEF TOLD US ABOUT
HER GRANDPAPA AND TAUGHT THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT BY SHOOTING IT
INTO BED WHENEVER IT ATTRACTED HER NOTICE

AS I AM NOW GENERALISING A PERIOD OF MY LIFE WITH THE OBJECT OF
CLEARING MY WAY BEFORE ME I CAN SCARCELY DO SO BETTER THAN BY AT ONCE
COMPLETING THE DESCRIPTION OF OUR USUAL MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AT
BARNARDS INN

WE SPENT AS MUCH MONEY AS WE COULD AND GOT AS LITTLE FOR IT AS PEOPLE
COULD MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO GIVE US WE WERE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS
MISERABLE AND MOST OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE WERE IN THE SAME CONDITION
THERE WAS A GAY FICTION AMONG US THAT WE WERE CONSTANTLY ENJOYING
OURSELVES AND A SKELETON TRUTH THAT WE NEVER DID TO THE BEST OF MY
BELIEF OUR CASE WAS IN THE LAST ASPECT A RATHER COMMON ONE

EVERY MORNING WITH AN AIR EVER NEW HERBERT WENT INTO THE CITY TO LOOK
ABOUT HIM I OFTEN PAID HIM A VISIT IN THE DARK BACKROOM IN WHICH HE
CONSORTED WITH AN INKJAR A HATPEG A COALBOX A STRINGBOX AN
ALMANAC A DESK AND STOOL AND A RULER AND I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT I
EVER SAW HIM DO ANYTHING ELSE BUT LOOK ABOUT HIM IF WE ALL DID WHAT WE
UNDERTAKE TO DO AS FAITHFULLY AS HERBERT DID WE MIGHT LIVE IN A
REPUBLIC OF THE VIRTUES HE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO POOR FELLOW EXCEPT
AT A CERTAIN HOUR OF EVERY AFTERNOON TO GO TO LLOYDSIN OBSERVANCE
OF A CEREMONY OF SEEING HIS PRINCIPAL I THINK HE NEVER DID ANYTHING
ELSE IN CONNECTION WITH LLOYDS THAT I COULD FIND OUT EXCEPT COME BACK
AGAIN WHEN HE FELT HIS CASE UNUSUALLY SERIOUS AND THAT HE POSITIVELY
MUST FIND AN OPENING HE WOULD GO ON CHANGE AT A BUSY TIME AND WALK
IN AND OUT IN A KIND OF GLOOMY COUNTRY DANCE FIGURE AMONG THE
ASSEMBLED MAGNATES FOR SAYS HERBERT TO ME COMING HOME TO DINNER ON
ONE OF THOSE SPECIAL OCCASIONS I FIND THE TRUTH TO BE HANDEL THAT
AN OPENING WONT COME TO ONE BUT ONE MUST GO TO ITSO I HAVE BEEN

IF WE HAD BEEN LESS ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER I THINK WE MUST HAVE HATED
ONE ANOTHER REGULARLY EVERY MORNING I DETESTED THE CHAMBERS BEYOND
EXPRESSION AT THAT PERIOD OF REPENTANCE AND COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT
OF THE AVENGERS LIVERY WHICH HAD A MORE EXPENSIVE AND A LESS
REMUNERATIVE APPEARANCE THEN THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN THE
FOURANDTWENTY HOURS AS WE GOT MORE AND MORE INTO DEBT BREAKFAST
BECAME A HOLLOWER AND HOLLOWER FORM AND BEING ON ONE OCCASION AT
BREAKFASTTIME THREATENED BY LETTER WITH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS NOT
UNWHOLLY UNCONNECTED AS MY LOCAL PAPER MIGHT PUT IT WITH JEWELERY
I WENT SO FAR AS TO SEIZE THE AVENGER BY HIS BLUE COLLAR AND SHAKE HIM
OFF HIS FEETSO THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR LIKE A BOOTED
CUPIDFOR PRESUMING TO SUPPOSE THAT WE WANTED A ROLL

AT CERTAIN TIMESMEANING AT UNCERTAIN TIMES FOR THEY DEPENDED ON OUR
HUMOURI WOULD SAY TO HERBERT AS IF IT WERE A REMARKABLE DISCOVERY

MY DEAR HERBERT WE ARE GETTING ON BADLY

MY DEAR HANDEL HERBERT WOULD SAY TO ME IN ALL SINCERITY IF YOU
WILL BELIEVE ME THOSE VERY WORDS WERE ON MY LIPS BY A STRANGE
COINCIDENCE

THEN HERBERT I WOULD RESPOND LET US LOOK INTO OUR AFFAIRS

WE ALWAYS DERIVED PROFOUND SATISFACTION FROM MAKING AN APPOINTMENT FOR
THIS PURPOSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WAS BUSINESS THIS WAS THE WAY TO
CONFRONT THE THING THIS WAS THE WAY TO TAKE THE FOE BY THE THROAT AND
I KNOW HERBERT THOUGHT SO TOO

WE ORDERED SOMETHING RATHER SPECIAL FOR DINNER WITH A BOTTLE OF
SOMETHING SIMILARLY OUT OF THE COMMON WAY IN ORDER THAT OUR MINDS
MIGHT BE FORTIFIED FOR THE OCCASION AND WE MIGHT COME WELL UP TO THE
MARK DINNER OVER WE PRODUCED A BUNDLE OF PENS A COPIOUS SUPPLY OF
INK AND A GOODLY SHOW OF WRITING AND BLOTTING PAPER FOR THERE WAS
SOMETHING VERY COMFORTABLE IN HAVING PLENTY OF STATIONERY

I WOULD THEN TAKE A SHEET OF PAPER AND WRITE ACROSS THE TOP OF IT IN
A NEAT HAND THE HEADING MEMORANDUM OF PIPS DEBTS WITH BARNARDS
INN AND THE DATE VERY CAREFULLY ADDED HERBERT WOULD ALSO TAKE A SHEET
OF PAPER AND WRITE ACROSS IT WITH SIMILAR FORMALITIES MEMORANDUM OF
HERBERTS DEBTS

EACH OF US WOULD THEN REFER TO A CONFUSED HEAP OF PAPERS AT HIS SIDE
WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN INTO DRAWERS WORN INTO HOLES IN POCKETS HALF
BURNT IN LIGHTING CANDLES STUCK FOR WEEKS INTO THE LOOKINGGLASS AND
OTHERWISE DAMAGED THE SOUND OF OUR PENS GOING REFRESHED US
EXCEEDINGLY INSOMUCH THAT I SOMETIMES FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS EDIFYING BUSINESS PROCEEDING AND ACTUALLY
PAYING THE MONEY IN POINT OF MERITORIOUS CHARACTER THE TWO THINGS
SEEMED ABOUT EQUAL

WHEN WE HAD WRITTEN A LITTLE WHILE I WOULD ASK HERBERT HOW HE GOT ON
HERBERT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN SCRATCHING HIS HEAD IN A MOST RUEFUL
MANNER AT THE SIGHT OF HIS ACCUMULATING FIGURES

THEY ARE MOUNTING UP HANDEL HERBERT WOULD SAY UPON MY LIFE THEY
ARE MOUNTING UP

BE FIRM HERBERT I WOULD RETORT PLYING MY OWN PEN WITH GREAT
ASSIDUITY LOOK THE THING IN THE FACE LOOK INTO YOUR AFFAIRS STARE
THEM OUT OF COUNTENANCE

SO I WOULD HANDEL ONLY THEY ARE STARING ME OUT OF COUNTENANCE

HOWEVER MY DETERMINED MANNER WOULD HAVE ITS EFFECT AND HERBERT WOULD
FALL TO WORK AGAIN AFTER A TIME HE WOULD GIVE UP ONCE MORE ON THE
PLEA THAT HE HAD NOT GOT COBBSS BILL OR LOBBSS OR NOBBSS AS THE
CASE MIGHT BE

THEN HERBERT ESTIMATE ESTIMATE IT IN ROUND NUMBERS AND PUT IT
DOWN

WHAT A FELLOW OF RESOURCE YOU ARE MY FRIEND WOULD REPLY WITH
ADMIRATION REALLY YOUR BUSINESS POWERS ARE VERY REMARKABLE

I THOUGHT SO TOO I ESTABLISHED WITH MYSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS THE
REPUTATION OF A FIRSTRATE MAN OF BUSINESSPROMPT DECISIVE
ENERGETIC CLEAR COOLHEADED WHEN I HAD GOT ALL MY RESPONSIBILITIES
DOWN UPON MY LIST I COMPARED EACH WITH THE BILL AND TICKED IT OFF MY
SELFAPPROVAL WHEN I TICKED AN ENTRY WAS QUITE A LUXURIOUS SENSATION
WHEN I HAD NO MORE TICKS TO MAKE I FOLDED ALL MY BILLS UP UNIFORMLY
DOCKETED EACH ON THE BACK AND TIED THE WHOLE INTO A SYMMETRICAL
BUNDLE THEN I DID THE SAME FOR HERBERT WHO MODESTLY SAID HE HAD NOT
MY ADMINISTRATIVE GENIUS AND FELT THAT I HAD BROUGHT HIS AFFAIRS INTO
A FOCUS FOR HIM

MY BUSINESS HABITS HAD ONE OTHER BRIGHT FEATURE WHICH I CALLED
LEAVING A MARGIN FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSING HERBERTS DEBTS TO BE ONE
HUNDRED AND SIXTYFOUR POUNDS FOURANDTWOPENCE I WOULD SAY LEAVE A
MARGIN AND PUT THEM DOWN AT TWO HUNDRED OR SUPPOSING MY OWN TO BE
FOUR TIMES AS MUCH I WOULD LEAVE A MARGIN AND PUT THEM DOWN AT SEVEN
HUNDRED I HAD THE HIGHEST OPINION OF THE WISDOM OF THIS SAME MARGIN
BUT I AM BOUND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ON LOOKING BACK I DEEM IT TO HAVE
BEEN AN EXPENSIVE DEVICE FOR WE ALWAYS RAN INTO NEW DEBT IMMEDIATELY
TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE MARGIN AND SOMETIMES IN THE SENSE OF
FREEDOM AND SOLVENCY IT IMPARTED GOT PRETTY FAR ON INTO ANOTHER
MARGIN

BUT THERE WAS A CALM A REST A VIRTUOUS HUSH CONSEQUENT ON THESE
EXAMINATIONS OF OUR AFFAIRS THAT GAVE ME FOR THE TIME AN ADMIRABLE
OPINION OF MYSELF SOOTHED BY MY EXERTIONS MY METHOD AND HERBERTS
COMPLIMENTS I WOULD SIT WITH HIS SYMMETRICAL BUNDLE AND MY OWN ON THE
TABLE BEFORE ME AMONG THE STATIONERY AND FEEL LIKE A BANK OF SOME
SORT RATHER THAN A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL

WE SHUT OUR OUTER DOOR ON THESE SOLEMN OCCASIONS IN ORDER THAT WE
MIGHT NOT BE INTERRUPTED I HAD FALLEN INTO MY SERENE STATE ONE
EVENING WHEN WE HEARD A LETTER DROPPED THROUGH THE SLIT IN THE SAID
DOOR AND FALL ON THE GROUND ITS FOR YOU HANDEL SAID HERBERT
GOING OUT AND COMING BACK WITH IT AND I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING THE
MATTER THIS WAS IN ALLUSION TO ITS HEAVY BLACK SEAL AND BORDER

THE LETTER WAS SIGNED TRABB  CO AND ITS CONTENTS WERE SIMPLY THAT I
WAS AN HONOURED SIR AND THAT THEY BEGGED TO INFORM ME THAT MRS J
GARGERY HAD DEPARTED THIS LIFE ON MONDAY LAST AT TWENTY MINUTES PAST
SIX IN THE EVENING AND THAT MY ATTENDANCE WAS REQUESTED AT THE
INTERMENT ON MONDAY NEXT AT THREE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON




CHAPTER XXXV


IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT A GRAVE HAD OPENED IN MY ROAD OF LIFE AND
THE GAP IT MADE IN THE SMOOTH GROUND WAS WONDERFUL THE FIGURE OF MY
SISTER IN HER CHAIR BY THE KITCHEN FIRE HAUNTED ME NIGHT AND DAY THAT
THE PLACE COULD POSSIBLY BE WITHOUT HER WAS SOMETHING MY MIND SEEMED
UNABLE TO COMPASS AND WHEREAS SHE HAD SELDOM OR NEVER BEEN IN MY
THOUGHTS OF LATE I HAD NOW THE STRANGEST IDEAS THAT SHE WAS COMING
TOWARDS ME IN THE STREET OR THAT SHE WOULD PRESENTLY KNOCK AT THE
DOOR IN MY ROOMS TOO WITH WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AT ALL ASSOCIATED
THERE WAS AT ONCE THE BLANKNESS OF DEATH AND A PERPETUAL SUGGESTION OF
THE SOUND OF HER VOICE OR THE TURN OF HER FACE OR FIGURE AS IF SHE
WERE STILL ALIVE AND HAD BEEN OFTEN THERE

WHATEVER MY FORTUNES MIGHT HAVE BEEN I COULD SCARCELY HAVE RECALLED MY
SISTER WITH MUCH TENDERNESS BUT I SUPPOSE THERE IS A SHOCK OF REGRET
WHICH MAY EXIST WITHOUT MUCH TENDERNESS UNDER ITS INFLUENCE AND
PERHAPS TO MAKE UP FOR THE WANT OF THE SOFTER FEELING I WAS SEIZED
WITH A VIOLENT INDIGNATION AGAINST THE ASSAILANT FROM WHOM SHE HAD
SUFFERED SO MUCH AND I FELT THAT ON SUFFICIENT PROOF I COULD HAVE
REVENGEFULLY PURSUED ORLICK OR ANY ONE ELSE TO THE LAST EXTREMITY

HAVING WRITTEN TO JOE TO OFFER HIM CONSOLATION AND TO ASSURE HIM THAT
I WOULD COME TO THE FUNERAL I PASSED THE INTERMEDIATE DAYS IN THE
CURIOUS STATE OF MIND I HAVE GLANCED AT I WENT DOWN EARLY IN THE
MORNING AND ALIGHTED AT THE BLUE BOAR IN GOOD TIME TO WALK OVER TO THE
FORGE

IT WAS FINE SUMMER WEATHER AGAIN AND AS I WALKED ALONG THE TIMES
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE HELPLESS CREATURE AND MY SISTER DID NOT SPARE ME
VIVIDLY RETURNED BUT THEY RETURNED WITH A GENTLE TONE UPON THEM THAT
SOFTENED EVEN THE EDGE OF TICKLER FOR NOW THE VERY BREATH OF THE
BEANS AND CLOVER WHISPERED TO MY HEART THAT THE DAY MUST COME WHEN IT
WOULD BE WELL FOR MY MEMORY THAT OTHERS WALKING IN THE SUNSHINE SHOULD
BE SOFTENED AS THEY THOUGHT OF ME

AT LAST I CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE AND SAW THAT TRABB AND CO
HAD PUT IN A FUNEREAL EXECUTION AND TAKEN POSSESSION TWO DISMALLY
ABSURD PERSONS EACH OSTENTATIOUSLY EXHIBITING A CRUTCH DONE UP IN A
BLACK BANDAGEAS IF THAT INSTRUMENT COULD POSSIBLY COMMUNICATE ANY
COMFORT TO ANYBODYWERE POSTED AT THE FRONT DOOR AND IN ONE OF THEM I
RECOGNISED A POSTBOY DISCHARGED FROM THE BOAR FOR TURNING A YOUNG
COUPLE INTO A SAWPIT ON THEIR BRIDAL MORNING IN CONSEQUENCE OF
INTOXICATION RENDERING IT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO RIDE HIS HORSE CLASPED
ROUND THE NECK WITH BOTH ARMS ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE VILLAGE AND
MOST OF THE WOMEN WERE ADMIRING THESE SABLE WARDERS AND THE CLOSED
WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE AND FORGE AND AS I CAME UP ONE OF THE TWO
WARDERS THE POSTBOY KNOCKED AT THE DOORIMPLYING THAT I WAS FAR TOO
MUCH EXHAUSTED BY GRIEF TO HAVE STRENGTH REMAINING TO KNOCK FOR MYSELF

ANOTHER SABLE WARDER A CARPENTER WHO HAD ONCE EATEN TWO GEESE FOR A
WAGER OPENED THE DOOR AND SHOWED ME INTO THE BEST PARLOUR HERE MR
TRABB HAD TAKEN UNTO HIMSELF THE BEST TABLE AND HAD GOT ALL THE LEAVES
UP AND WAS HOLDING A KIND OF BLACK BAZAAR WITH THE AID OF A QUANTITY
OF BLACK PINS AT THE MOMENT OF MY ARRIVAL HE HAD JUST FINISHED
PUTTING SOMEBODYS HAT INTO BLACK LONGCLOTHES LIKE AN AFRICAN BABY
SO HE HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR MINE BUT I MISLED BY THE ACTION AND
CONFUSED BY THE OCCASION SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH EVERY TESTIMONY OF
WARM AFFECTION

POOR DEAR JOE ENTANGLED IN A LITTLE BLACK CLOAK TIED IN A LARGE BOW
UNDER HIS CHIN WAS SEATED APART AT THE UPPER END OF THE ROOM WHERE
AS CHIEF MOURNER HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN STATIONED BY TRABB WHEN I BENT
DOWN AND SAID TO HIM DEAR JOE HOW ARE YOU HE SAID PIP OLD CHAP
YOU KNOWED HER WHEN SHE WERE A FINE FIGURE OF A AND CLASPED MY HAND
AND SAID NO MORE

BIDDY LOOKING VERY NEAT AND MODEST IN HER BLACK DRESS WENT QUIETLY
HERE AND THERE AND WAS VERY HELPFUL WHEN I HAD SPOKEN TO BIDDY AS I
THOUGHT IT NOT A TIME FOR TALKING I WENT AND SAT DOWN NEAR JOE AND
THERE BEGAN TO WONDER IN WHAT PART OF THE HOUSE ITSHEMY SISTERWAS
THE AIR OF THE PARLOUR BEING FAINT WITH THE SMELL OF SWEETCAKE I
LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE TABLE OF REFRESHMENTS IT WAS SCARCELY VISIBLE
UNTIL ONE HAD GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THE GLOOM BUT THERE WAS A CUTUP PLUM
CAKE UPON IT AND THERE WERE CUTUP ORANGES AND SANDWICHES AND
BISCUITS AND TWO DECANTERS THAT I KNEW VERY WELL AS ORNAMENTS BUT HAD
NEVER SEEN USED IN ALL MY LIFE ONE FULL OF PORT AND ONE OF SHERRY
STANDING AT THIS TABLE I BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE SERVILE PUMBLECHOOK
IN A BLACK CLOAK AND SEVERAL YARDS OF HATBAND WHO WAS ALTERNATELY
STUFFING HIMSELF AND MAKING OBSEQUIOUS MOVEMENTS TO CATCH MY
ATTENTION THE MOMENT HE SUCCEEDED HE CAME OVER TO ME BREATHING
SHERRY AND CRUMBS AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE MAY I DEAR SIR AND
DID I THEN DESCRIED MR AND MRS HUBBLE THE LASTNAMED IN A DECENT
SPEECHLESS PAROXYSM IN A CORNER WE WERE ALL GOING TO FOLLOW AND
WERE ALL IN COURSE OF BEING TIED UP SEPARATELY BY TRABB INTO
RIDICULOUS BUNDLES

WHICH I MEANTERSAY PIP JOE WHISPERED ME AS WE WERE BEING WHAT MR
TRABB CALLED FORMED IN THE PARLOUR TWO AND TWOAND IT WAS
DREADFULLY LIKE A PREPARATION FOR SOME GRIM KIND OF DANCE WHICH I
MEANTERSAY SIR AS I WOULD IN PREFERENCE HAVE CARRIED HER TO THE
CHURCH MYSELF ALONG WITH THREE OR FOUR FRIENDLY ONES WOT COME TO IT
WITH WILLING HARTS AND ARMS BUT IT WERE CONSIDERED WOT THE NEIGHBOURS
WOULD LOOK DOWN ON SUCH AND WOULD BE OF OPINIONS AS IT WERE WANTING IN
RESPECT

POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS OUT ALL CRIED MR TRABB AT THIS POINT IN A
DEPRESSED BUSINESSLIKE VOICE POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS OUT WE ARE
READY

SO WE ALL PUT OUR POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS TO OUR FACES AS IF OUR NOSES
WERE BLEEDING AND FILED OUT TWO AND TWO JOE AND I BIDDY AND
PUMBLECHOOK MR AND MRS HUBBLE THE REMAINS OF MY POOR SISTER HAD
BEEN BROUGHT ROUND BY THE KITCHEN DOOR AND IT BEING A POINT OF
UNDERTAKING CEREMONY THAT THE SIX BEARERS MUST BE STIFLED AND BLINDED
UNDER A HORRIBLE BLACK VELVET HOUSING WITH A WHITE BORDER THE WHOLE
LOOKED LIKE A BLIND MONSTER WITH TWELVE HUMAN LEGS SHUFFLING AND
BLUNDERING ALONG UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF TWO KEEPERSTHE POSTBOY AND
HIS COMRADE

THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HOWEVER HIGHLY APPROVED OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND
WE WERE MUCH ADMIRED AS WE WENT THROUGH THE VILLAGE THE MORE YOUTHFUL
AND VIGOROUS PART OF THE COMMUNITY MAKING DASHES NOW AND THEN TO CUT US
OFF AND LYING IN WAIT TO INTERCEPT US AT POINTS OF VANTAGE AT SUCH
TIMES THE MORE EXUBERANT AMONG THEM CALLED OUT IN AN EXCITED MANNER ON
OUR EMERGENCE ROUND SOME CORNER OF EXPECTANCY HERE THEY COME
HERE THEY ARE AND WE WERE ALL BUT CHEERED IN THIS PROGRESS I WAS
MUCH ANNOYED BY THE ABJECT PUMBLECHOOK WHO BEING BEHIND ME PERSISTED
ALL THE WAY AS A DELICATE ATTENTION IN ARRANGING MY STREAMING HATBAND
AND SMOOTHING MY CLOAK MY THOUGHTS WERE FURTHER DISTRACTED BY THE
EXCESSIVE PRIDE OF MR AND MRS HUBBLE WHO WERE SURPASSINGLY CONCEITED
AND VAINGLORIOUS IN BEING MEMBERS OF SO DISTINGUISHED A PROCESSION

AND NOW THE RANGE OF MARSHES LAY CLEAR BEFORE US WITH THE SAILS OF THE
SHIPS ON THE RIVER GROWING OUT OF IT AND WE WENT INTO THE CHURCHYARD
CLOSE TO THE GRAVES OF MY UNKNOWN PARENTS PHILIP PIRRIP LATE OF THIS
PARISH AND ALSO GEORGIANA WIFE OF THE ABOVE AND THERE MY SISTER WAS
LAID QUIETLY IN THE EARTH WHILE THE LARKS SANG HIGH ABOVE IT AND THE
LIGHT WIND STREWED IT WITH BEAUTIFUL SHADOWS OF CLOUDS AND TREES

OF THE CONDUCT OF THE WORLDLY MINDED PUMBLECHOOK WHILE THIS WAS DOING
I DESIRE TO SAY NO MORE THAN IT WAS ALL ADDRESSED TO ME AND THAT EVEN
WHEN THOSE NOBLE PASSAGES WERE READ WHICH REMIND HUMANITY HOW IT
BROUGHT NOTHING INTO THE WORLD AND CAN TAKE NOTHING OUT AND HOW IT
FLEETH LIKE A SHADOW AND NEVER CONTINUETH LONG IN ONE STAY I HEARD HIM
COUGH A RESERVATION OF THE CASE OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CAME
UNEXPECTEDLY INTO LARGE PROPERTY WHEN WE GOT BACK HE HAD THE
HARDIHOOD TO TELL ME THAT HE WISHED MY SISTER COULD HAVE KNOWN I HAD
DONE HER SO MUCH HONOUR AND TO HINT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT
REASONABLY PURCHASED AT THE PRICE OF HER DEATH AFTER THAT HE DRANK
ALL THE REST OF THE SHERRY AND MR HUBBLE DRANK THE PORT AND THE TWO
TALKED WHICH I HAVE SINCE OBSERVED TO BE CUSTOMARY IN SUCH CASES AS
IF THEY WERE OF QUITE ANOTHER RACE FROM THE DECEASED AND WERE
NOTORIOUSLY IMMORTAL FINALLY HE WENT AWAY WITH MR AND MRS
HUBBLETO MAKE AN EVENING OF IT I FELT SURE AND TO TELL THE JOLLY
BARGEMEN THAT HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF MY FORTUNES AND MY EARLIEST
BENEFACTOR

WHEN THEY WERE ALL GONE AND WHEN TRABB AND HIS MENBUT NOT HIS BOY I
LOOKED FOR HIMHAD CRAMMED THEIR MUMMERY INTO BAGS AND WERE GONE TOO
THE HOUSE FELT WHOLESOMER SOON AFTERWARDS BIDDY JOE AND I HAD A
COLD DINNER TOGETHER BUT WE DINED IN THE BEST PARLOUR NOT IN THE OLD
KITCHEN AND JOE WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR WHAT HE DID WITH HIS
KNIFE AND FORK AND THE SALTCELLAR AND WHAT NOT THAT THERE WAS GREAT
RESTRAINT UPON US BUT AFTER DINNER WHEN I MADE HIM TAKE HIS PIPE AND
WHEN I HAD LOITERED WITH HIM ABOUT THE FORGE AND WHEN WE SAT DOWN
TOGETHER ON THE GREAT BLOCK OF STONE OUTSIDE IT WE GOT ON BETTER I
NOTICED THAT AFTER THE FUNERAL JOE CHANGED HIS CLOTHES SO FAR AS TO
MAKE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN HIS SUNDAY DRESS AND WORKING DRESS IN WHICH
THE DEAR FELLOW LOOKED NATURAL AND LIKE THE MAN HE WAS

HE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED BY MY ASKING IF I MIGHT SLEEP IN MY OWN LITTLE
ROOM AND I WAS PLEASED TOO FOR I FELT THAT I HAD DONE RATHER A GREAT
THING IN MAKING THE REQUEST WHEN THE SHADOWS OF EVENING WERE CLOSING
IN I TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING INTO THE GARDEN WITH BIDDY FOR A
LITTLE TALK

BIDDY SAID I I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN TO ME ABOUT THESE SAD
MATTERS

DO YOU MR PIP SAID BIDDY I SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN IF I HAD THOUGHT
THAT

DONT SUPPOSE THAT I MEAN TO BE UNKIND BIDDY WHEN I SAY I CONSIDER
THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT THAT

DO YOU MR PIP

SHE WAS SO QUIET AND HAD SUCH AN ORDERLY GOOD AND PRETTY WAY WITH
HER THAT I DID NOT LIKE THE THOUGHT OF MAKING HER CRY AGAIN AFTER
LOOKING A LITTLE AT HER DOWNCAST EYES AS SHE WALKED BESIDE ME I GAVE
UP THAT POINT

I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO REMAIN HERE NOW BIDDY
DEAR

OH I CANT DO SO MR PIP SAID BIDDY IN A TONE OF REGRET BUT STILL
OF QUIET CONVICTION I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO MRS HUBBLE AND I AM
GOING TO HER TOMORROW I HOPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO TAKE SOME CARE OF
MR GARGERY TOGETHER UNTIL HE SETTLES DOWN

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE BIDDY IF YOU WANT ANY MO

HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE REPEATED BIDDY STRIKING IN WITH A MOMENTARY
FLUSH UPON HER FACE ILL TELL YOU MR PIP I AM GOING TO TRY TO GET
THE PLACE OF MISTRESS IN THE NEW SCHOOL NEARLY FINISHED HERE I CAN BE
WELL RECOMMENDED BY ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND I HOPE I CAN BE INDUSTRIOUS
AND PATIENT AND TEACH MYSELF WHILE I TEACH OTHERS YOU KNOW MR PIP
PURSUED BIDDY WITH A SMILE AS SHE RAISED HER EYES TO MY FACE THE
NEW SCHOOLS ARE NOT LIKE THE OLD BUT I LEARNT A GOOD DEAL FROM YOU
AFTER THAT TIME AND HAVE HAD TIME SINCE THEN TO IMPROVE

I THINK YOU WOULD ALWAYS IMPROVE BIDDY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

AH EXCEPT IN MY BAD SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE MURMURED BIDDY

IT WAS NOT SO MUCH A REPROACH AS AN IRRESISTIBLE THINKING ALOUD WELL
I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE UP THAT POINT TOO SO I WALKED A LITTLE FURTHER
WITH BIDDY LOOKING SILENTLY AT HER DOWNCAST EYES

I HAVE NOT HEARD THE PARTICULARS OF MY SISTERS DEATH BIDDY

THEY ARE VERY SLIGHT POOR THING SHE HAD BEEN IN ONE OF HER BAD
STATESTHOUGH THEY HAD GOT BETTER OF LATE RATHER THAN WORSEFOR FOUR
DAYS WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF IT IN THE EVENING JUST AT TEATIME AND
SAID QUITE PLAINLY JOE AS SHE HAD NEVER SAID ANY WORD FOR A LONG
WHILE I RAN AND FETCHED IN MR GARGERY FROM THE FORGE SHE MADE SIGNS
TO ME THAT SHE WANTED HIM TO SIT DOWN CLOSE TO HER AND WANTED ME TO
PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK SO I PUT THEM ROUND HIS NECK AND SHE LAID
HER HEAD DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER QUITE CONTENT AND SATISFIED AND SO SHE
PRESENTLY SAID JOE AGAIN AND ONCE PARDON AND ONCE PIP AND SO
SHE NEVER LIFTED HER HEAD UP ANY MORE AND IT WAS JUST AN HOUR LATER
WHEN WE LAID IT DOWN ON HER OWN BED BECAUSE WE FOUND SHE WAS GONE

BIDDY CRIED THE DARKENING GARDEN AND THE LANE AND THE STARS THAT
WERE COMING OUT WERE BLURRED IN MY OWN SIGHT

NOTHING WAS EVER DISCOVERED BIDDY

NOTHING

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS BECOME OF ORLICK

I SHOULD THINK FROM THE COLOUR OF HIS CLOTHES THAT HE IS WORKING IN
THE QUARRIES

OF COURSE YOU HAVE SEEN HIM THENWHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT DARK
TREE IN THE LANE

I SAW HIM THERE ON THE NIGHT SHE DIED

THAT WAS NOT THE LAST TIME EITHER BIDDY

NO I HAVE SEEN HIM THERE SINCE WE HAVE BEEN WALKING HEREIT IS OF
NO USE SAID BIDDY LAYING HER HAND UPON MY ARM AS I WAS FOR RUNNING
OUT YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT DECEIVE YOU HE WAS NOT THERE A MINUTE AND
HE IS GONE

IT REVIVED MY UTMOST INDIGNATION TO FIND THAT SHE WAS STILL PURSUED BY
THIS FELLOW AND I FELT INVETERATE AGAINST HIM I TOLD HER SO AND TOLD
HER THAT I WOULD SPEND ANY MONEY OR TAKE ANY PAINS TO DRIVE HIM OUT OF
THAT COUNTRY BY DEGREES SHE LED ME INTO MORE TEMPERATE TALK AND SHE
TOLD ME HOW JOE LOVED ME AND HOW JOE NEVER COMPLAINED OF ANYTHINGSHE
DIDNT SAY OF ME SHE HAD NO NEED I KNEW WHAT SHE MEANTBUT EVER DID
HIS DUTY IN HIS WAY OF LIFE WITH A STRONG HAND A QUIET TONGUE AND A
GENTLE HEART

INDEED IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY TOO MUCH FOR HIM SAID I AND BIDDY
WE MUST OFTEN SPEAK OF THESE THINGS FOR OF COURSE I SHALL BE OFTEN
DOWN HERE NOW I AM NOT GOING TO LEAVE POOR JOE ALONE

BIDDY SAID NEVER A SINGLE WORD

BIDDY DONT YOU HEAR ME

YES MR PIP

NOT TO MENTION YOUR CALLING ME MR PIPWHICH APPEARS TO ME TO BE IN
BAD TASTE BIDDYWHAT DO YOU MEAN

WHAT DO I MEAN ASKED BIDDY TIMIDLY

BIDDY SAID I IN A VIRTUOUSLY SELFASSERTING MANNER I MUST REQUEST
TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS

BY THIS SAID BIDDY

NOW DONT ECHO I RETORTED YOU USED NOT TO ECHO BIDDY

USED NOT SAID BIDDY O MR PIP USED

WELL I RATHER THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE UP THAT POINT TOO AFTER ANOTHER
SILENT TURN IN THE GARDEN I FELL BACK ON THE MAIN POSITION

BIDDY SAID I I MADE A REMARK RESPECTING MY COMING DOWN HERE OFTEN
TO SEE JOE WHICH YOU RECEIVED WITH A MARKED SILENCE HAVE THE
GOODNESS BIDDY TO TELL ME WHY

ARE YOU QUITE SURE THEN THAT YOU WILL COME TO SEE HIM OFTEN ASKED
BIDDY STOPPING IN THE NARROW GARDEN WALK AND LOOKING AT ME UNDER THE
STARS WITH A CLEAR AND HONEST EYE

O DEAR ME SAID I AS IF I FOUND MYSELF COMPELLED TO GIVE UP BIDDY IN
DESPAIR THIS REALLY IS A VERY BAD SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE DONT SAY ANY
MORE IF YOU PLEASE BIDDY THIS SHOCKS ME VERY MUCH

FOR WHICH COGENT REASON I KEPT BIDDY AT A DISTANCE DURING SUPPER AND
WHEN I WENT UP TO MY OWN OLD LITTLE ROOM TOOK AS STATELY A LEAVE OF
HER AS I COULD IN MY MURMURING SOUL DEEM RECONCILABLE WITH THE
CHURCHYARD AND THE EVENT OF THE DAY AS OFTEN AS I WAS RESTLESS IN THE
NIGHT AND THAT WAS EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR I REFLECTED WHAT AN
UNKINDNESS WHAT AN INJURY WHAT AN INJUSTICE BIDDY HAD DONE ME

EARLY IN THE MORNING I WAS TO GO EARLY IN THE MORNING I WAS OUT AND
LOOKING IN UNSEEN AT ONE OF THE WOODEN WINDOWS OF THE FORGE THERE I
STOOD FOR MINUTES LOOKING AT JOE ALREADY AT WORK WITH A GLOW OF
HEALTH AND STRENGTH UPON HIS FACE THAT MADE IT SHOW AS IF THE BRIGHT
SUN OF THE LIFE IN STORE FOR HIM WERE SHINING ON IT

GOODBYE DEAR JOENO DONT WIPE IT OFFFOR GODS SAKE GIVE ME YOUR
BLACKENED HANDI SHALL BE DOWN SOON AND OFTEN

ILLUSTRATION

NEVER TOO SOON SIR SAID JOE AND NEVER TOO OFTEN PIP

BIDDY WAS WAITING FOR ME AT THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH A MUG OF NEW MILK
AND A CRUST OF BREAD BIDDY SAID I WHEN I GAVE HER MY HAND AT
PARTING I AM NOT ANGRY BUT I AM HURT

NO DONT BE HURT SHE PLEADED QUITE PATHETICALLY LET ONLY ME BE
HURT IF I HAVE BEEN UNGENEROUS

ONCE MORE THE MISTS WERE RISING AS I WALKED AWAY IF THEY DISCLOSED TO
ME AS I SUSPECT THEY DID THAT I SHOULD NOT COME BACK AND THAT
BIDDY WAS QUITE RIGHT ALL I CAN SAY ISTHEY WERE QUITE RIGHT TOO




CHAPTER XXXVI


HERBERT AND I WENT ON FROM BAD TO WORSE IN THE WAY OF INCREASING OUR
DEBTS LOOKING INTO OUR AFFAIRS LEAVING MARGINS AND THE LIKE
EXEMPLARY TRANSACTIONS AND TIME WENT ON WHETHER OR NO AS HE HAS A
WAY OF DOING AND I CAME OF AGEIN FULFILMENT OF HERBERTS PREDICTION
THAT I SHOULD DO SO BEFORE I KNEW WHERE I WAS

HERBERT HIMSELF HAD COME OF AGE EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE ME AS HE HAD
NOTHING ELSE THAN HIS MAJORITY TO COME INTO THE EVENT DID NOT MAKE A
PROFOUND SENSATION IN BARNARDS INN BUT WE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO MY
ONEANDTWENTIETH BIRTHDAY WITH A CROWD OF SPECULATIONS AND
ANTICIPATIONS FOR WE HAD BOTH CONSIDERED THAT MY GUARDIAN COULD HARDLY
HELP SAYING SOMETHING DEFINITE ON THAT OCCASION

I HAD TAKEN CARE TO HAVE IT WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LITTLE BRITAIN WHEN MY
BIRTHDAY WAS ON THE DAY BEFORE IT I RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL NOTE FROM
WEMMICK INFORMING ME THAT MR JAGGERS WOULD BE GLAD IF I WOULD CALL
UPON HIM AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE AUSPICIOUS DAY THIS CONVINCED
US THAT SOMETHING GREAT WAS TO HAPPEN AND THREW ME INTO AN UNUSUAL
FLUTTER WHEN I REPAIRED TO MY GUARDIANS OFFICE A MODEL OF
PUNCTUALITY

IN THE OUTER OFFICE WEMMICK OFFERED ME HIS CONGRATULATIONS AND
INCIDENTALLY RUBBED THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH A FOLDED PIECE OF
TISSUEPAPER THAT I LIKED THE LOOK OF BUT HE SAID NOTHING RESPECTING
IT AND MOTIONED ME WITH A NOD INTO MY GUARDIANS ROOM IT WAS
NOVEMBER AND MY GUARDIAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIS FIRE LEANING HIS BACK
AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE WITH HIS HANDS UNDER HIS COATTAILS

WELL PIP SAID HE I MUST CALL YOU MR PIP TODAY CONGRATULATIONS
MR PIP

WE SHOOK HANDSHE WAS ALWAYS A REMARKABLY SHORT SHAKERAND I THANKED
HIM

TAKE A CHAIR MR PIP SAID MY GUARDIAN

AS I SAT DOWN AND HE PRESERVED HIS ATTITUDE AND BENT HIS BROWS AT HIS
BOOTS I FELT AT A DISADVANTAGE WHICH REMINDED ME OF THAT OLD TIME
WHEN I HAD BEEN PUT UPON A TOMBSTONE THE TWO GHASTLY CASTS ON THE
SHELF WERE NOT FAR FROM HIM AND THEIR EXPRESSION WAS AS IF THEY WERE
MAKING A STUPID APOPLECTIC ATTEMPT TO ATTEND TO THE CONVERSATION

NOW MY YOUNG FRIEND MY GUARDIAN BEGAN AS IF I WERE A WITNESS IN THE
BOX I AM GOING TO HAVE A WORD OR TWO WITH YOU

IF YOU PLEASE SIR

WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SAID MR JAGGERS BENDING FORWARD TO LOOK AT THE
GROUND AND THEN THROWING HIS HEAD BACK TO LOOK AT THE CEILINGWHAT
DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE LIVING AT THE RATE OF

AT THE RATE OF SIR

AT REPEATED MR JAGGERS STILL LOOKING AT THE CEILING
THERATEOF AND THEN LOOKED ALL ROUND THE ROOM AND PAUSED WITH HIS
POCKETHANDKERCHIEF IN HIS HAND HALFWAY TO HIS NOSE

I HAD LOOKED INTO MY AFFAIRS SO OFTEN THAT I HAD THOROUGHLY DESTROYED
ANY SLIGHT NOTION I MIGHT EVER HAVE HAD OF THEIR BEARINGS RELUCTANTLY
I CONFESSED MYSELF QUITE UNABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THIS REPLY
SEEMED AGREEABLE TO MR JAGGERS WHO SAID I THOUGHT SO AND BLEW HIS
NOSE WITH AN AIR OF SATISFACTION

NOW I HAVE ASKED YOU A QUESTION MY FRIEND SAID MR JAGGERS
HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO ASK ME

OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A GREAT RELIEF TO ME TO ASK YOU SEVERAL
QUESTIONS SIR BUT I REMEMBER YOUR PROHIBITION

ASK ONE SAID MR JAGGERS

NO ASK ANOTHER

IS THAT CONFIDENCE TO BE IMPARTED TO ME SOON

WAIVE THAT A MOMENT SAID MR JAGGERS AND ASK ANOTHER

I LOOKED ABOUT ME BUT THERE APPEARED TO BE NOW NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE FROM
THE INQUIRY HAVEIANYTHING TO RECEIVE SIR ON THAT MR JAGGERS
SAID TRIUMPHANTLY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD COME TO IT AND CALLED TO
WEMMICK TO GIVE HIM THAT PIECE OF PAPER WEMMICK APPEARED HANDED IT
IN AND DISAPPEARED

NOW MR PIP SAID MR JAGGERS ATTEND IF YOU PLEASE YOU HAVE BEEN
DRAWING PRETTY FREELY HERE YOUR NAME OCCURS PRETTY OFTEN IN WEMMICKS

I DONT ASK YOU WHAT YOU OWE BECAUSE YOU DONT KNOW AND IF YOU DID
KNOW YOU WOULDNT TELL ME YOU WOULD SAY LESS YES YES MY FRIEND
CRIED MR JAGGERS WAVING HIS FOREFINGER TO STOP ME AS I MADE A SHOW OF
PROTESTING ITS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT YOU THINK YOU WOULDNT BUT YOU
WOULD YOULL EXCUSE ME BUT I KNOW BETTER THAN YOU NOW TAKE THIS
PIECE OF PAPER IN YOUR HAND YOU HAVE GOT IT VERY GOOD NOW UNFOLD IT
AND TELL ME WHAT IT IS

THIS IS A BANKNOTE SAID I FOR FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS

THAT IS A BANKNOTE REPEATED MR JAGGERS FOR FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
AND A VERY HANDSOME SUM OF MONEY TOO I THINK YOU CONSIDER IT SO

HOW COULD I DO OTHERWISE

AH BUT ANSWER THE QUESTION SAID MR JAGGERS

UNDOUBTEDLY

YOU CONSIDER IT UNDOUBTEDLY A HANDSOME SUM OF MONEY NOW THAT
HANDSOME SUM OF MONEY PIP IS YOUR OWN IT IS A PRESENT TO YOU ON THIS
DAY IN EARNEST OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND AT THE RATE OF THAT HANDSOME
SUM OF MONEY PER ANNUM AND AT NO HIGHER RATE YOU ARE TO LIVE UNTIL
THE DONOR OF THE WHOLE APPEARS THAT IS TO SAY YOU WILL NOW TAKE YOUR
MONEY AFFAIRS ENTIRELY INTO YOUR OWN HANDS AND YOU WILL DRAW FROM
WEMMICK ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE POUNDS PER QUARTER UNTIL YOU ARE
IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE FOUNTAINHEAD AND NO LONGER WITH THE MERE
AGENT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE I AM THE MERE AGENT I EXECUTE MY
INSTRUCTIONS AND I AM PAID FOR DOING SO I THINK THEM INJUDICIOUS BUT
I AM NOT PAID FOR GIVING ANY OPINION ON THEIR MERITS

I WAS BEGINNING TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO MY BENEFACTOR FOR THE GREAT
LIBERALITY WITH WHICH I WAS TREATED WHEN MR JAGGERS STOPPED ME I AM
NOT PAID PIP SAID HE COOLLY TO CARRY YOUR WORDS TO ANY ONE AND
THEN GATHERED UP HIS COATTAILS AS HE HAD GATHERED UP THE SUBJECT AND
STOOD FROWNING AT HIS BOOTS AS IF HE SUSPECTED THEM OF DESIGNS AGAINST
HIM

AFTER A PAUSE I HINTED

THERE WAS A QUESTION JUST NOW MR JAGGERS WHICH YOU DESIRED ME TO
WAIVE FOR A MOMENT I HOPE I AM DOING NOTHING WRONG IN ASKING IT
AGAIN

WHAT IS IT SAID HE

I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WOULD NEVER HELP ME OUT BUT IT TOOK ME
ABACK TO HAVE TO SHAPE THE QUESTION AFRESH AS IF IT WERE QUITE NEW
IS IT LIKELY I SAID AFTER HESITATING THAT MY PATRON THE
FOUNTAINHEAD YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF MR JAGGERS WILL SOON THERE I
DELICATELY STOPPED

WILL SOON WHAT ASKED MR JAGGERS THATS NO QUESTION AS IT STANDS
YOU KNOW

WILL SOON COME TO LONDON SAID I AFTER CASTING ABOUT FOR A PRECISE
FORM OF WORDS OR SUMMON ME ANYWHERE ELSE

NOW HERE REPLIED MR JAGGERS FIXING ME FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH HIS
DARK DEEPSET EYES WE MUST REVERT TO THE EVENING WHEN WE FIRST
ENCOUNTERED ONE ANOTHER IN YOUR VILLAGE WHAT DID I TELL YOU THEN
PIP

YOU TOLD ME MR JAGGERS THAT IT MIGHT BE YEARS HENCE WHEN THAT
PERSON APPEARED

JUST SO SAID MR JAGGERS THATS MY ANSWER

AS WE LOOKED FULL AT ONE ANOTHER I FELT MY BREATH COME QUICKER IN MY
STRONG DESIRE TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIM AND AS I FELT THAT IT CAME
QUICKER AND AS I FELT THAT HE SAW THAT IT CAME QUICKER I FELT THAT I
HAD LESS CHANCE THAN EVER OF GETTING ANYTHING OUT OF HIM

DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WILL STILL BE YEARS HENCE MR JAGGERS

MR JAGGERS SHOOK HIS HEADNOT IN NEGATIVING THE QUESTION BUT IN
ALTOGETHER NEGATIVING THE NOTION THAT HE COULD ANYHOW BE GOT TO ANSWER
ITAND THE TWO HORRIBLE CASTS OF THE TWITCHED FACES LOOKED WHEN MY
EYES STRAYED UP TO THEM AS IF THEY HAD COME TO A CRISIS IN THEIR
SUSPENDED ATTENTION AND WERE GOING TO SNEEZE

COME SAID MR JAGGERS WARMING THE BACKS OF HIS LEGS WITH THE BACKS
OF HIS WARMED HANDS ILL BE PLAIN WITH YOU MY FRIEND PIP THATS A
QUESTION I MUST NOT BE ASKED YOULL UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER WHEN I
TELL YOU ITS A QUESTION THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE ME COME ILL GO A
LITTLE FURTHER WITH YOU ILL SAY SOMETHING MORE

HE BENT DOWN SO LOW TO FROWN AT HIS BOOTS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO RUB THE
CALVES OF HIS LEGS IN THE PAUSE HE MADE

WHEN THAT PERSON DISCLOSES SAID MR JAGGERS STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF
YOU AND THAT PERSON WILL SETTLE YOUR OWN AFFAIRS WHEN THAT PERSON
DISCLOSES MY PART IN THIS BUSINESS WILL CEASE AND DETERMINE WHEN THAT
PERSON DISCLOSES IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT AND THATS ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY

WE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER UNTIL I WITHDREW MY EYES AND LOOKED
THOUGHTFULLY AT THE FLOOR FROM THIS LAST SPEECH I DERIVED THE NOTION
THAT MISS HAVISHAM FOR SOME REASON OR NO REASON HAD NOT TAKEN HIM
INTO HER CONFIDENCE AS TO HER DESIGNING ME FOR ESTELLA THAT HE
RESENTED THIS AND FELT A JEALOUSY ABOUT IT OR THAT HE REALLY DID
OBJECT TO THAT SCHEME AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WHEN I
RAISED MY EYES AGAIN I FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN SHREWDLY LOOKING AT ME
ALL THE TIME AND WAS DOING SO STILL

IF THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY SIR I REMARKED THERE CAN BE
NOTHING LEFT FOR ME TO SAY

HE NODDED ASSENT AND PULLED OUT HIS THIEFDREADED WATCH AND ASKED ME
WHERE I WAS GOING TO DINE I REPLIED AT MY OWN CHAMBERS WITH HERBERT
AS A NECESSARY SEQUENCE I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD FAVOUR US WITH HIS
COMPANY AND HE PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION BUT HE INSISTED ON
WALKING HOME WITH ME IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT MAKE NO EXTRA PREPARATION
FOR HIM AND FIRST HE HAD A LETTER OR TWO TO WRITE AND OF COURSE HAD
HIS HANDS TO WASH SO I SAID I WOULD GO INTO THE OUTER OFFICE AND TALK
TO WEMMICK

THE FACT WAS THAT WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS HAD COME INTO MY
POCKET A THOUGHT HAD COME INTO MY HEAD WHICH HAD BEEN OFTEN THERE
BEFORE AND IT APPEARED TO ME THAT WEMMICK WAS A GOOD PERSON TO ADVISE
WITH CONCERNING SUCH THOUGHT

HE HAD ALREADY LOCKED UP HIS SAFE AND MADE PREPARATIONS FOR GOING
HOME HE HAD LEFT HIS DESK BROUGHT OUT HIS TWO GREASY OFFICE
CANDLESTICKS AND STOOD THEM IN LINE WITH THE SNUFFERS ON A SLAB NEAR
THE DOOR READY TO BE EXTINGUISHED HE HAD RAKED HIS FIRE LOW PUT HIS
HAT AND GREATCOAT READY AND WAS BEATING HIMSELF ALL OVER THE CHEST
WITH HIS SAFEKEY AS AN ATHLETIC EXERCISE AFTER BUSINESS

MR WEMMICK SAID I I WANT TO ASK YOUR OPINION I AM VERY DESIROUS
TO SERVE A FRIEND

WEMMICK TIGHTENED HIS POSTOFFICE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF HIS OPINION
WERE DEAD AGAINST ANY FATAL WEAKNESS OF THAT SORT

THIS FRIEND I PURSUED IS TRYING TO GET ON IN COMMERCIAL LIFE BUT
HAS NO MONEY AND FINDS IT DIFFICULT AND DISHEARTENING TO MAKE A
BEGINNING NOW I WANT SOMEHOW TO HELP HIM TO A BEGINNING

WITH MONEY DOWN SAID WEMMICK IN A TONE DRIER THAN ANY SAWDUST

WITH SOME MONEY DOWN I REPLIED FOR AN UNEASY REMEMBRANCE SHOT
ACROSS ME OF THAT SYMMETRICAL BUNDLE OF PAPERS AT HOMEWITH SOME
MONEY DOWN AND PERHAPS SOME ANTICIPATION OF MY EXPECTATIONS

MR PIP SAID WEMMICK I SHOULD LIKE JUST TO RUN OVER WITH YOU ON MY
FINGERS IF YOU PLEASE THE NAMES OF THE VARIOUS BRIDGES UP AS HIGH AS
CHELSEA REACH LETS SEE THERES LONDON ONE SOUTHWARK TWO
BLACKFRIARS THREE WATERLOO FOUR WESTMINSTER FIVE VAUXHALL SIX
HE HAD CHECKED OFF EACH BRIDGE IN ITS TURN WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS
SAFEKEY ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND THERES AS MANY AS SIX YOU SEE TO
CHOOSE FROM

I DONT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID I

CHOOSE YOUR BRIDGE MR PIP RETURNED WEMMICK AND TAKE A WALK UPON
YOUR BRIDGE AND PITCH YOUR MONEY INTO THE THAMES OVER THE CENTRE ARCH
OF YOUR BRIDGE AND YOU KNOW THE END OF IT SERVE A FRIEND WITH IT AND
YOU MAY KNOW THE END OF IT TOOBUT ITS A LESS PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE
END

I COULD HAVE POSTED A NEWSPAPER IN HIS MOUTH HE MADE IT SO WIDE AFTER
SAYING THIS

THIS IS VERY DISCOURAGING SAID I

MEANT TO BE SO SAID WEMMICK

THEN IS IT YOUR OPINION I INQUIRED WITH SOME LITTLE INDIGNATION
THAT A MAN SHOULD NEVER

INVEST PORTABLE PROPERTY IN A FRIEND SAID WEMMICK CERTAINLY HE
SHOULD NOT UNLESS HE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE FRIENDAND THEN IT
BECOMES A QUESTION HOW MUCH PORTABLE PROPERTY IT MAY BE WORTH TO GET
RID OF HIM

AND THAT SAID I IS YOUR DELIBERATE OPINION MR WEMMICK

THAT HE RETURNED IS MY DELIBERATE OPINION IN THIS OFFICE

AH SAID I PRESSING HIM FOR I THOUGHT I SAW HIM NEAR A LOOPHOLE
HERE BUT WOULD THAT BE YOUR OPINION AT WALWORTH

MR PIP HE REPLIED WITH GRAVITY WALWORTH IS ONE PLACE AND THIS
OFFICE IS ANOTHER MUCH AS THE AGED IS ONE PERSON AND MR JAGGERS IS
ANOTHER THEY MUST NOT BE CONFOUNDED TOGETHER MY WALWORTH SENTIMENTS
MUST BE TAKEN AT WALWORTH NONE BUT MY OFFICIAL SENTIMENTS CAN BE TAKEN
IN THIS OFFICE

VERY WELL SAID I MUCH RELIEVED THEN I SHALL LOOK YOU UP AT
WALWORTH YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT

MR PIP HE RETURNED YOU WILL BE WELCOME THERE IN A PRIVATE AND
PERSONAL CAPACITY

WE HAD HELD THIS CONVERSATION IN A LOW VOICE WELL KNOWING MY
GUARDIANS EARS TO BE THE SHARPEST OF THE SHARP AS HE NOW APPEARED IN
HIS DOORWAY TOWELLING HIS HANDS WEMMICK GOT ON HIS GREATCOAT AND
STOOD BY TO SNUFF OUT THE CANDLES WE ALL THREE WENT INTO THE STREET
TOGETHER AND FROM THE DOORSTEP WEMMICK TURNED HIS WAY AND MR
JAGGERS AND I TURNED OURS

I COULD NOT HELP WISHING MORE THAN ONCE THAT EVENING THAT MR JAGGERS
HAD HAD AN AGED IN GERRARD STREET OR A STINGER OR A SOMETHING OR A
SOMEBODY TO UNBEND HIS BROWS A LITTLE IT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE
CONSIDERATION ON A TWENTYFIRST BIRTHDAY THAT COMING OF AGE AT ALL
SEEMED HARDLY WORTH WHILE IN SUCH A GUARDED AND SUSPICIOUS WORLD AS HE
MADE OF IT HE WAS A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER INFORMED AND CLEVERER THAN
WEMMICK AND YET I WOULD A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE HAD WEMMICK TO
DINNER AND MR JAGGERS MADE NOT ME ALONE INTENSELY MELANCHOLY
BECAUSE AFTER HE WAS GONE HERBERT SAID OF HIMSELF WITH HIS EYES
FIXED ON THE FIRE THAT HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE COMMITTED A FELONY AND
FORGOTTEN THE DETAILS OF IT HE FELT SO DEJECTED AND GUILTY




CHAPTER XXXVII


DEEMING SUNDAY THE BEST DAY FOR TAKING MR WEMMICKS WALWORTH
SENTIMENTS I DEVOTED THE NEXT ENSUING SUNDAY AFTERNOON TO A PILGRIMAGE
TO THE CASTLE ON ARRIVING BEFORE THE BATTLEMENTS I FOUND THE UNION
JACK FLYING AND THE DRAWBRIDGE UP BUT UNDETERRED BY THIS SHOW OF
DEFIANCE AND RESISTANCE I RANG AT THE GATE AND WAS ADMITTED IN A MOST
PACIFIC MANNER BY THE AGED

MY SON SIR SAID THE OLD MAN AFTER SECURING THE DRAWBRIDGE RATHER
HAD IT IN HIS MIND THAT YOU MIGHT HAPPEN TO DROP IN AND HE LEFT WORD
THAT HE WOULD SOON BE HOME FROM HIS AFTERNOONS WALK HE IS VERY
REGULAR IN HIS WALKS IS MY SON VERY REGULAR IN EVERYTHING IS MY
SON

I NODDED AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AS WEMMICK HIMSELF MIGHT HAVE NODDED AND
WE WENT IN AND SAT DOWN BY THE FIRESIDE

YOU MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MY SON SIR SAID THE OLD MAN IN HIS
CHIRPING WAY WHILE HE WARMED HIS HANDS AT THE BLAZE AT HIS OFFICE I
EXPECT I NODDED HAH I HAVE HEERD THAT MY SON IS A WONDERFUL HAND
AT HIS BUSINESS SIR I NODDED HARD YES SO THEY TELL ME HIS
BUSINESS IS THE LAW I NODDED HARDER WHICH MAKES IT MORE SURPRISING
IN MY SON SAID THE OLD MAN FOR HE WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THE LAW
BUT TO THE WINECOOPERING

CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN STOOD INFORMED CONCERNING THE
REPUTATION OF MR JAGGERS I ROARED THAT NAME AT HIM HE THREW ME INTO
THE GREATEST CONFUSION BY LAUGHING HEARTILY AND REPLYING IN A VERY
SPRIGHTLY MANNER NO TO BE SURE YOURE RIGHT AND TO THIS HOUR I
HAVE NOT THE FAINTEST NOTION WHAT HE MEANT OR WHAT JOKE HE THOUGHT I
HAD MADE

AS I COULD NOT SIT THERE NODDING AT HIM PERPETUALLY WITHOUT MAKING
SOME OTHER ATTEMPT TO INTEREST HIM I SHOUTED AT INQUIRY WHETHER HIS
OWN CALLING IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE WINECOOPERING BY DINT OF STRAINING
THAT TERM OUT OF MYSELF SEVERAL TIMES AND TAPPING THE OLD GENTLEMAN ON
THE CHEST TO ASSOCIATE IT WITH HIM I AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MY
MEANING UNDERSTOOD

NO SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE WAREHOUSING THE WAREHOUSING FIRST
OVER YONDER HE APPEARED TO MEAN UP THE CHIMNEY BUT I BELIEVE HE
INTENDED TO REFER ME TO LIVERPOOL AND THEN IN THE CITY OF LONDON
HERE HOWEVER HAVING AN INFIRMITYFOR I AM HARD OF HEARING SIR

I EXPRESSED IN PANTOMIME THE GREATEST ASTONISHMENT

YES HARD OF HEARING HAVING THAT INFIRMITY COMING UPON ME MY SON HE
WENT INTO THE LAW AND HE TOOK CHARGE OF ME AND HE BY LITTLE AND
LITTLE MADE OUT THIS ELEGANT AND BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY BUT RETURNING TO
WHAT YOU SAID YOU KNOW PURSUED THE OLD MAN AGAIN LAUGHING HEARTILY
WHAT I SAY IS NO TO BE SURE YOURE RIGHT

I WAS MODESTLY WONDERING WHETHER MY UTMOST INGENUITY WOULD HAVE ENABLED
ME TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE AMUSED HIM HALF AS MUCH AS THIS
IMAGINARY PLEASANTRY WHEN I WAS STARTLED BY A SUDDEN CLICK IN THE WALL
ON ONE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY AND THE GHOSTLY TUMBLING OPEN OF A LITTLE
WOODEN FLAP WITH JOHN UPON IT THE OLD MAN FOLLOWING MY EYES CRIED
WITH GREAT TRIUMPH MY SONS COME HOME AND WE BOTH WENT OUT TO THE
DRAWBRIDGE

IT WAS WORTH ANY MONEY TO SEE WEMMICK WAVING A SALUTE TO ME FROM THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE MOAT WHEN WE MIGHT HAVE SHAKEN HANDS ACROSS IT WITH
THE GREATEST EASE THE AGED WAS SO DELIGHTED TO WORK THE DRAWBRIDGE
THAT I MADE NO OFFER TO ASSIST HIM BUT STOOD QUIET UNTIL WEMMICK HAD
COME ACROSS AND HAD PRESENTED ME TO MISS SKIFFINS A LADY BY WHOM HE
WAS ACCOMPANIED

MISS SKIFFINS WAS OF A WOODEN APPEARANCE AND WAS LIKE HER ESCORT IN
THE POSTOFFICE BRANCH OF THE SERVICE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME TWO OR
THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN WEMMICK AND I JUDGED HER TO STAND POSSESSED
OF PORTABLE PROPERTY THE CUT OF HER DRESS FROM THE WAIST UPWARD BOTH
BEFORE AND BEHIND MADE HER FIGURE VERY LIKE A BOYS KITE AND I MIGHT
HAVE PRONOUNCED HER GOWN A LITTLE TOO DECIDEDLY ORANGE AND HER GLOVES
A LITTLE TOO INTENSELY GREEN BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE A GOOD SORT OF
FELLOW AND SHOWED A HIGH REGARD FOR THE AGED I WAS NOT LONG IN
DISCOVERING THAT SHE WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR AT THE CASTLE FOR ON OUR
GOING IN AND MY COMPLIMENTING WEMMICK ON HIS INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE FOR
ANNOUNCING HIMSELF TO THE AGED HE BEGGED ME TO GIVE MY ATTENTION FOR A
MOMENT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY AND DISAPPEARED PRESENTLY
ANOTHER CLICK CAME AND ANOTHER LITTLE DOOR TUMBLED OPEN WITH MISS
SKIFFINS ON IT THEN MISS SKIFFINS SHUT UP AND JOHN TUMBLED OPEN THEN
MISS SKIFFINS AND JOHN BOTH TUMBLED OPEN TOGETHER AND FINALLY SHUT UP
TOGETHER ON WEMMICKS RETURN FROM WORKING THESE MECHANICAL APPLIANCES
I EXPRESSED THE GREAT ADMIRATION WITH WHICH I REGARDED THEM AND HE
SAID WELL YOU KNOW THEYRE BOTH PLEASANT AND USEFUL TO THE AGED
AND BY GEORGE SIR ITS A THING WORTH MENTIONING THAT OF ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS GATE THE SECRET OF THOSE PULLS IS ONLY KNOWN
TO THE AGED MISS SKIFFINS AND ME

AND MR WEMMICK MADE THEM ADDED MISS SKIFFINS WITH HIS OWN HANDS
OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD

WHILE MISS SKIFFINS WAS TAKING OFF HER BONNET SHE RETAINED HER GREEN
GLOVES DURING THE EVENING AS AN OUTWARD AND VISIBLE SIGN THAT THERE WAS
COMPANY WEMMICK INVITED ME TO TAKE A WALK WITH HIM ROUND THE
PROPERTY AND SEE HOW THE ISLAND LOOKED IN WINTERTIME THINKING THAT HE
DID THIS TO GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING HIS WALWORTH SENTIMENTS I
SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY AS SOON AS WE WERE OUT OF THE CASTLE

HAVING THOUGHT OF THE MATTER WITH CARE I APPROACHED MY SUBJECT AS IF I
HAD NEVER HINTED AT IT BEFORE I INFORMED WEMMICK THAT I WAS ANXIOUS IN
BEHALF OF HERBERT POCKET AND I TOLD HIM HOW WE HAD FIRST MET AND HOW
WE HAD FOUGHT I GLANCED AT HERBERTS HOME AND AT HIS CHARACTER AND
AT HIS HAVING NO MEANS BUT SUCH AS HE WAS DEPENDENT ON HIS FATHER FOR
THOSE UNCERTAIN AND UNPUNCTUAL I ALLUDED TO THE ADVANTAGES I HAD
DERIVED IN MY FIRST RAWNESS AND IGNORANCE FROM HIS SOCIETY AND I
CONFESSED THAT I FEARED I HAD BUT ILL REPAID THEM AND THAT HE MIGHT
HAVE DONE BETTER WITHOUT ME AND MY EXPECTATIONS KEEPING MISS HAVISHAM
IN THE BACKGROUND AT A GREAT DISTANCE I STILL HINTED AT THE
POSSIBILITY OF MY HAVING COMPETED WITH HIM IN HIS PROSPECTS AND AT THE
CERTAINTY OF HIS POSSESSING A GENEROUS SOUL AND BEING FAR ABOVE ANY
MEAN DISTRUSTS RETALIATIONS OR DESIGNS FOR ALL THESE REASONS I TOLD
WEMMICK AND BECAUSE HE WAS MY YOUNG COMPANION AND FRIEND AND I HAD A
GREAT AFFECTION FOR HIM I WISHED MY OWN GOOD FORTUNE TO REFLECT SOME
RAYS UPON HIM AND THEREFORE I SOUGHT ADVICE FROM WEMMICKS EXPERIENCE
AND KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND AFFAIRS HOW I COULD BEST TRY WITH MY
RESOURCES TO HELP HERBERT TO SOME PRESENT INCOMESAY OF A HUNDRED A
YEAR TO KEEP HIM IN GOOD HOPE AND HEARTAND GRADUALLY TO BUY HIM ON
TO SOME SMALL PARTNERSHIP I BEGGED WEMMICK IN CONCLUSION TO
UNDERSTAND THAT MY HELP MUST ALWAYS BE RENDERED WITHOUT HERBERTS
KNOWLEDGE OR SUSPICION AND THAT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD
WITH WHOM I COULD ADVISE I WOUND UP BY LAYING MY HAND UPON HIS
SHOULDER AND SAYING I CANT HELP CONFIDING IN YOU THOUGH I KNOW IT
MUST BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU BUT THAT IS YOUR FAULT IN HAVING EVER
BROUGHT ME HERE

WEMMICK WAS SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID WITH A KIND OF
START WELL YOU KNOW MR PIP I MUST TELL YOU ONE THING THIS IS
DEVILISH GOOD OF YOU

SAY YOULL HELP ME TO BE GOOD THEN SAID I

ECOD REPLIED WEMMICK SHAKING HIS HEAD THATS NOT MY TRADE

NOR IS THIS YOUR TRADINGPLACE SAID I

YOU ARE RIGHT HE RETURNED YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD MR PIP
ILL PUT ON MY CONSIDERINGCAP AND I THINK ALL YOU WANT TO DO MAY BE
DONE BY DEGREES SKIFFINS THATS HER BROTHER IS AN ACCOUNTANT AND
AGENT ILL LOOK HIM UP AND GO TO WORK FOR YOU

I THANK YOU TEN THOUSAND TIMES

ON THE CONTRARY SAID HE I THANK YOU FOR THOUGH WE ARE STRICTLY IN
OUR PRIVATE AND PERSONAL CAPACITY STILL IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT THERE
ARE NEWGATE COBWEBS ABOUT AND IT BRUSHES THEM AWAY

AFTER A LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION TO THE SAME EFFECT WE RETURNED
INTO THE CASTLE WHERE WE FOUND MISS SKIFFINS PREPARING TEA THE
RESPONSIBLE DUTY OF MAKING THE TOAST WAS DELEGATED TO THE AGED AND
THAT EXCELLENT OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO INTENT UPON IT THAT HE SEEMED TO ME
IN SOME DANGER OF MELTING HIS EYES IT WAS NO NOMINAL MEAL THAT WE WERE
GOING TO MAKE BUT A VIGOROUS REALITY THE AGED PREPARED SUCH A
HAYSTACK OF BUTTERED TOAST THAT I COULD SCARCELY SEE HIM OVER IT AS
IT SIMMERED ON AN IRON STAND HOOKED ON TO THE TOPBAR WHILE MISS
SKIFFINS BREWED SUCH A JORUM OF TEA THAT THE PIG IN THE BACK PREMISES
BECAME STRONGLY EXCITED AND REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

THE FLAG HAD BEEN STRUCK AND THE GUN HAD BEEN FIRED AT THE RIGHT
MOMENT OF TIME AND I FELT AS SNUGLY CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF WALWORTH
AS IF THE MOAT WERE THIRTY FEET WIDE BY AS MANY DEEP NOTHING DISTURBED
THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE CASTLE BUT THE OCCASIONAL TUMBLING OPEN OF
JOHN AND MISS SKIFFINS WHICH LITTLE DOORS WERE A PREY TO SOME
SPASMODIC INFIRMITY THAT MADE ME SYMPATHETICALLY UNCOMFORTABLE UNTIL I
GOT USED TO IT I INFERRED FROM THE METHODICAL NATURE OF MISS
SKIFFINSS ARRANGEMENTS THAT SHE MADE TEA THERE EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT AND
I RATHER SUSPECTED THAT A CLASSIC BROOCH SHE WORE REPRESENTING THE
PROFILE OF AN UNDESIRABLE FEMALE WITH A VERY STRAIGHT NOSE AND A VERY
NEW MOON WAS A PIECE OF PORTABLE PROPERTY THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN HER BY
WEMMICK

WE ATE THE WHOLE OF THE TOAST AND DRANK TEA IN PROPORTION AND IT WAS
DELIGHTFUL TO SEE HOW WARM AND GREASY WE ALL GOT AFTER IT THE AGED
ESPECIALLY MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SOME CLEAN OLD CHIEF OF A SAVAGE
TRIBE JUST OILED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE OF REPOSE MISS SKIFFINSIN THE
ABSENCE OF THE LITTLE SERVANT WHO IT SEEMED RETIRED TO THE BOSOM OF
HER FAMILY ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONSWASHED UP THE TEATHINGS IN A TRIFLING
LADYLIKE AMATEUR MANNER THAT COMPROMISED NONE OF US THEN SHE PUT ON
HER GLOVES AGAIN AND WE DREW ROUND THE FIRE AND WEMMICK SAID NOW
AGED PARENT TIP US THE PAPER

WEMMICK EXPLAINED TO ME WHILE THE AGED GOT HIS SPECTACLES OUT THAT
THIS WAS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM AND THAT IT GAVE THE OLD GENTLEMAN
INFINITE SATISFACTION TO READ THE NEWS ALOUD I WONT OFFER AN
APOLOGY SAID WEMMICK FOR HE ISNT CAPABLE OF MANY PLEASURESARE
YOU AGED P

ALL RIGHT JOHN ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE OLD MAN SEEING HIMSELF
SPOKEN TO

ONLY TIP HIM A NOD EVERY NOW AND THEN WHEN HE LOOKS OFF HIS PAPER
SAID WEMMICK AND HELL BE AS HAPPY AS A KING WE ARE ALL ATTENTION
AGED ONE

ALL RIGHT JOHN ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE CHEERFUL OLD MAN SO BUSY
AND SO PLEASED THAT IT REALLY WAS QUITE CHARMING

THE AGEDS READING REMINDED ME OF THE CLASSES AT MR WOPSLES
GREATAUNTS WITH THE PLEASANTER PECULIARITY THAT IT SEEMED TO COME
THROUGH A KEYHOLE AS HE WANTED THE CANDLES CLOSE TO HIM AND AS HE WAS
ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF PUTTING EITHER HIS HEAD OR THE NEWSPAPER INTO
THEM HE REQUIRED AS MUCH WATCHING AS A POWDERMILL BUT WEMMICK WAS
EQUALLY UNTIRING AND GENTLE IN HIS VIGILANCE AND THE AGED READ ON
QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS MANY RESCUES WHENEVER HE LOOKED AT US WE ALL
EXPRESSED THE GREATEST INTEREST AND AMAZEMENT AND NODDED UNTIL HE
RESUMED AGAIN

AS WEMMICK AND MISS SKIFFINS SAT SIDE BY SIDE AND AS I SAT IN A
SHADOWY CORNER I OBSERVED A SLOW AND GRADUAL ELONGATION OF MR
WEMMICKS MOUTH POWERFULLY SUGGESTIVE OF HIS SLOWLY AND GRADUALLY
STEALING HIS ARM ROUND MISS SKIFFINSS WAIST IN COURSE OF TIME I SAW
HIS HAND APPEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MISS SKIFFINS BUT AT THAT MOMENT
MISS SKIFFINS NEATLY STOPPED HIM WITH THE GREEN GLOVE UNWOUND HIS ARM
AGAIN AS IF IT WERE AN ARTICLE OF DRESS AND WITH THE GREATEST
DELIBERATION LAID IT ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER MISS SKIFFINSS COMPOSURE
WHILE SHE DID THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE SIGHTS I HAVE EVER
SEEN AND IF I COULD HAVE THOUGHT THE ACT CONSISTENT WITH ABSTRACTION
OF MIND I SHOULD HAVE DEEMED THAT MISS SKIFFINS PERFORMED IT
MECHANICALLY

BY AND BY I NOTICED WEMMICKS ARM BEGINNING TO DISAPPEAR AGAIN AND
GRADUALLY FADING OUT OF VIEW SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HIS MOUTH BEGAN TO
WIDEN AGAIN AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SUSPENSE ON MY PART THAT WAS QUITE
ENTHRALLING AND ALMOST PAINFUL I SAW HIS HAND APPEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF MISS SKIFFINS INSTANTLY MISS SKIFFINS STOPPED IT WITH THE NEATNESS
OF A PLACID BOXER TOOK OFF THAT GIRDLE OR CESTUS AS BEFORE AND LAID
IT ON THE TABLE TAKING THE TABLE TO REPRESENT THE PATH OF VIRTUE I AM
JUSTIFIED IN STATING THAT DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THE AGEDS READING
WEMMICKS ARM WAS STRAYING FROM THE PATH OF VIRTUE AND BEING RECALLED
TO IT BY MISS SKIFFINS

AT LAST THE AGED READ HIMSELF INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER THIS WAS THE TIME
FOR WEMMICK TO PRODUCE A LITTLE KETTLE A TRAY OF GLASSES AND A BLACK
BOTTLE WITH A PORCELAINTOPPED CORK REPRESENTING SOME CLERICAL
DIGNITARY OF A RUBICUND AND SOCIAL ASPECT WITH THE AID OF THESE
APPLIANCES WE ALL HAD SOMETHING WARM TO DRINK INCLUDING THE AGED WHO
WAS SOON AWAKE AGAIN MISS SKIFFINS MIXED AND I OBSERVED THAT SHE AND
WEMMICK DRANK OUT OF ONE GLASS OF COURSE I KNEW BETTER THAN TO OFFER
TO SEE MISS SKIFFINS HOME AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I THOUGHT I HAD
BEST GO FIRST WHICH I DID TAKING A CORDIAL LEAVE OF THE AGED AND
HAVING PASSED A PLEASANT EVENING

BEFORE A WEEK WAS OUT I RECEIVED A NOTE FROM WEMMICK DATED WALWORTH
STATING THAT HE HOPED HE HAD MADE SOME ADVANCE IN THAT MATTER
APPERTAINING TO OUR PRIVATE AND PERSONAL CAPACITIES AND THAT HE WOULD
BE GLAD IF I COULD COME AND SEE HIM AGAIN UPON IT SO I WENT OUT TO
WALWORTH AGAIN AND YET AGAIN AND YET AGAIN AND I SAW HIM BY
APPOINTMENT IN THE CITY SEVERAL TIMES BUT NEVER HELD ANY COMMUNICATION
WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT IN OR NEAR LITTLE BRITAIN THE UPSHOT WAS THAT
WE FOUND A WORTHY YOUNG MERCHANT OR SHIPPINGBROKER NOT LONG
ESTABLISHED IN BUSINESS WHO WANTED INTELLIGENT HELP AND WHO WANTED
CAPITAL AND WHO IN DUE COURSE OF TIME AND RECEIPT WOULD WANT A
PARTNER BETWEEN HIM AND ME SECRET ARTICLES WERE SIGNED OF WHICH
HERBERT WAS THE SUBJECT AND I PAID HIM HALF OF MY FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
DOWN AND ENGAGED FOR SUNDRY OTHER PAYMENTS SOME TO FALL DUE AT
CERTAIN DATES OUT OF MY INCOME SOME CONTINGENT ON MY COMING INTO MY
PROPERTY MISS SKIFFINSS BROTHER CONDUCTED THE NEGOTIATION WEMMICK
PERVADED IT THROUGHOUT BUT NEVER APPEARED IN IT

THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS SO CLEVERLY MANAGED THAT HERBERT HAD NOT THE
LEAST SUSPICION OF MY HAND BEING IN IT I NEVER SHALL FORGET THE
RADIANT FACE WITH WHICH HE CAME HOME ONE AFTERNOON AND TOLD ME AS A
MIGHTY PIECE OF NEWS OF HIS HAVING FALLEN IN WITH ONE CLARRIKER THE
YOUNG MERCHANTS NAME AND OF CLARRIKERS HAVING SHOWN AN
EXTRAORDINARY INCLINATION TOWARDS HIM AND OF HIS BELIEF THAT THE
OPENING HAD COME AT LAST DAY BY DAY AS HIS HOPES GREW STRONGER AND HIS
FACE BRIGHTER HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME A MORE AND MORE AFFECTIONATE
FRIEND FOR I HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RESTRAINING MY TEARS OF
TRIUMPH WHEN I SAW HIM SO HAPPY AT LENGTH THE THING BEING DONE AND
HE HAVING THAT DAY ENTERED CLARRIKERS HOUSE AND HE HAVING TALKED TO
ME FOR A WHOLE EVENING IN A FLUSH OF PLEASURE AND SUCCESS I DID REALLY
CRY IN GOOD EARNEST WHEN I WENT TO BED TO THINK THAT MY EXPECTATIONS
HAD DONE SOME GOOD TO SOMEBODY

A GREAT EVENT IN MY LIFE THE TURNING POINT OF MY LIFE NOW OPENS ON MY
VIEW BUT BEFORE I PROCEED TO NARRATE IT AND BEFORE I PASS ON TO ALL
THE CHANGES IT INVOLVED I MUST GIVE ONE CHAPTER TO ESTELLA IT IS NOT
MUCH TO GIVE TO THE THEME THAT SO LONG FILLED MY HEART




CHAPTER XXXVIII


IF THAT STAID OLD HOUSE NEAR THE GREEN AT RICHMOND SHOULD EVER COME TO
BE HAUNTED WHEN I AM DEAD IT WILL BE HAUNTED SURELY BY MY GHOST O
THE MANY MANY NIGHTS AND DAYS THROUGH WHICH THE UNQUIET SPIRIT WITHIN
ME HAUNTED THAT HOUSE WHEN ESTELLA LIVED THERE LET MY BODY BE WHERE IT
WOULD MY SPIRIT WAS ALWAYS WANDERING WANDERING WANDERING ABOUT THAT
HOUSE

THE LADY WITH WHOM ESTELLA WAS PLACED MRS BRANDLEY BY NAME WAS A
WIDOW WITH ONE DAUGHTER SEVERAL YEARS OLDER THAN ESTELLA THE MOTHER
LOOKED YOUNG AND THE DAUGHTER LOOKED OLD THE MOTHERS COMPLEXION WAS
PINK AND THE DAUGHTERS WAS YELLOW THE MOTHER SET UP FOR FRIVOLITY
AND THE DAUGHTER FOR THEOLOGY THEY WERE IN WHAT IS CALLED A GOOD
POSITION AND VISITED AND WERE VISITED BY NUMBERS OF PEOPLE LITTLE
IF ANY COMMUNITY OF FEELING SUBSISTED BETWEEN THEM AND ESTELLA BUT
THE UNDERSTANDING WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THEY WERE NECESSARY TO HER AND
THAT SHE WAS NECESSARY TO THEM MRS BRANDLEY HAD BEEN A FRIEND OF MISS
HAVISHAMS BEFORE THE TIME OF HER SECLUSION

IN MRS BRANDLEYS HOUSE AND OUT OF MRS BRANDLEYS HOUSE I SUFFERED
EVERY KIND AND DEGREE OF TORTURE THAT ESTELLA COULD CAUSE ME THE
NATURE OF MY RELATIONS WITH HER WHICH PLACED ME ON TERMS OF
FAMILIARITY WITHOUT PLACING ME ON TERMS OF FAVOUR CONDUCED TO MY
DISTRACTION SHE MADE USE OF ME TO TEASE OTHER ADMIRERS AND SHE TURNED
THE VERY FAMILIARITY BETWEEN HERSELF AND ME TO THE ACCOUNT OF PUTTING A
CONSTANT SLIGHT ON MY DEVOTION TO HER IF I HAD BEEN HER SECRETARY
STEWARD HALFBROTHER POOR RELATIONIF I HAD BEEN A YOUNGER BROTHER
OF HER APPOINTED HUSBANDI COULD NOT HAVE SEEMED TO MYSELF FURTHER
FROM MY HOPES WHEN I WAS NEAREST TO HER THE PRIVILEGE OF CALLING HER
BY HER NAME AND HEARING HER CALL ME BY MINE BECAME UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES AN AGGRAVATION OF MY TRIALS AND WHILE I THINK IT LIKELY
THAT IT ALMOST MADDENED HER OTHER LOVERS I KNOW TOO CERTAINLY THAT IT
ALMOST MADDENED ME

SHE HAD ADMIRERS WITHOUT END NO DOUBT MY JEALOUSY MADE AN ADMIRER OF
EVERY ONE WHO WENT NEAR HER BUT THERE WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THEM
WITHOUT THAT

I SAW HER OFTEN AT RICHMOND I HEARD OF HER OFTEN IN TOWN AND I USED
OFTEN TO TAKE HER AND THE BRANDLEYS ON THE WATER THERE WERE PICNICS
FTE DAYS PLAYS OPERAS CONCERTS PARTIES ALL SORTS OF PLEASURES
THROUGH WHICH I PURSUED HERAND THEY WERE ALL MISERIES TO ME I NEVER
HAD ONE HOURS HAPPINESS IN HER SOCIETY AND YET MY MIND ALL ROUND THE
FOURANDTWENTY HOURS WAS HARPING ON THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING HER WITH
ME UNTO DEATH

THROUGHOUT THIS PART OF OUR INTERCOURSEAND IT LASTED AS WILL
PRESENTLY BE SEEN FOR WHAT I THEN THOUGHT A LONG TIMESHE HABITUALLY
REVERTED TO THAT TONE WHICH EXPRESSED THAT OUR ASSOCIATION WAS FORCED
UPON US THERE WERE OTHER TIMES WHEN SHE WOULD COME TO A SUDDEN CHECK
IN THIS TONE AND IN ALL HER MANY TONES AND WOULD SEEM TO PITY ME

PIP PIP SHE SAID ONE EVENING COMING TO SUCH A CHECK WHEN WE SAT
APART AT A DARKENING WINDOW OF THE HOUSE IN RICHMOND WILL YOU NEVER
TAKE WARNING

OF WHAT

OF ME

WARNING NOT TO BE ATTRACTED BY YOU DO YOU MEAN ESTELLA

DO I MEAN IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU ARE BLIND

I SHOULD HAVE REPLIED THAT LOVE WAS COMMONLY REPUTED BLIND BUT FOR THE
REASON THAT I ALWAYS WAS RESTRAINEDAND THIS WAS NOT THE LEAST OF MY
MISERIESBY A FEELING THAT IT WAS UNGENEROUS TO PRESS MYSELF UPON HER
WHEN SHE KNEW THAT SHE COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT OBEY MISS HAVISHAM MY
DREAD ALWAYS WAS THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE ON HER PART LAID ME UNDER A HEAVY
DISADVANTAGE WITH HER PRIDE AND MADE ME THE SUBJECT OF A REBELLIOUS
STRUGGLE IN HER BOSOM

AT ANY RATE SAID I I HAVE NO WARNING GIVEN ME JUST NOW FOR YOU
WROTE TO ME TO COME TO YOU THIS TIME

THATS TRUE SAID ESTELLA WITH A COLD CARELESS SMILE THAT ALWAYS
CHILLED ME

AFTER LOOKING AT THE TWILIGHT WITHOUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE WENT ON
TO SAY

THE TIME HAS COME ROUND WHEN MISS HAVISHAM WISHES TO HAVE ME FOR A DAY
AT SATIS YOU ARE TO TAKE ME THERE AND BRING ME BACK IF YOU WILL SHE
WOULD RATHER I DID NOT TRAVEL ALONE AND OBJECTS TO RECEIVING MY MAID
FOR SHE HAS A SENSITIVE HORROR OF BEING TALKED OF BY SUCH PEOPLE CAN
YOU TAKE ME

CAN I TAKE YOU ESTELLA

YOU CAN THEN THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW IF YOU PLEASE YOU ARE TO PAY
ALL CHARGES OUT OF MY PURSE YOU HEAR THE CONDITION OF YOUR GOING

AND MUST OBEY SAID I

THIS WAS ALL THE PREPARATION I RECEIVED FOR THAT VISIT OR FOR OTHERS
LIKE IT MISS HAVISHAM NEVER WROTE TO ME NOR HAD I EVER SO MUCH AS
SEEN HER HANDWRITING WE WENT DOWN ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE AND WE
FOUND HER IN THE ROOM WHERE I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER AND IT IS NEEDLESS
TO ADD THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN SATIS HOUSE

SHE WAS EVEN MORE DREADFULLY FOND OF ESTELLA THAN SHE HAD BEEN WHEN I
LAST SAW THEM TOGETHER I REPEAT THE WORD ADVISEDLY FOR THERE WAS
SOMETHING POSITIVELY DREADFUL IN THE ENERGY OF HER LOOKS AND EMBRACES
SHE HUNG UPON ESTELLAS BEAUTY HUNG UPON HER WORDS HUNG UPON HER
GESTURES AND SAT MUMBLING HER OWN TREMBLING FINGERS WHILE SHE LOOKED
AT HER AS THOUGH SHE WERE DEVOURING THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE SHE HAD
REARED

FROM ESTELLA SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SEARCHING GLANCE THAT SEEMED TO
PRY INTO MY HEART AND PROBE ITS WOUNDS HOW DOES SHE USE YOU PIP HOW
DOES SHE USE YOU SHE ASKED ME AGAIN WITH HER WITCHLIKE EAGERNESS
EVEN IN ESTELLAS HEARING BUT WHEN WE SAT BY HER FLICKERING FIRE AT
NIGHT SHE WAS MOST WEIRD FOR THEN KEEPING ESTELLAS HAND DRAWN
THROUGH HER ARM AND CLUTCHED IN HER OWN HAND SHE EXTORTED FROM HER BY
DINT OF REFERRING BACK TO WHAT ESTELLA HAD TOLD HER IN HER REGULAR
LETTERS THE NAMES AND CONDITIONS OF THE MEN WHOM SHE HAD FASCINATED
AND AS MISS HAVISHAM DWELT UPON THIS ROLL WITH THE INTENSITY OF A MIND
MORTALLY HURT AND DISEASED SHE SAT WITH HER OTHER HAND ON HER CRUTCH
STICK AND HER CHIN ON THAT AND HER WAN BRIGHT EYES GLARING AT ME A
VERY SPECTRE

I SAW IN THIS WRETCHED THOUGH IT MADE ME AND BITTER THE SENSE OF
DEPENDENCE AND EVEN OF DEGRADATION THAT IT AWAKENEDI SAW IN THIS THAT
ESTELLA WAS SET TO WREAK MISS HAVISHAMS REVENGE ON MEN AND THAT SHE
WAS NOT TO BE GIVEN TO ME UNTIL SHE HAD GRATIFIED IT FOR A TERM I SAW
IN THIS A REASON FOR HER BEING BEFOREHAND ASSIGNED TO ME SENDING HER
OUT TO ATTRACT AND TORMENT AND DO MISCHIEF MISS HAVISHAM SENT HER WITH
THE MALICIOUS ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS BEYOND THE REACH OF ALL ADMIRERS
AND THAT ALL WHO STAKED UPON THAT CAST WERE SECURED TO LOSE I SAW IN
THIS THAT I TOO WAS TORMENTED BY A PERVERSION OF INGENUITY EVEN
WHILE THE PRIZE WAS RESERVED FOR ME I SAW IN THIS THE REASON FOR MY
BEING STAVED OFF SO LONG AND THE REASON FOR MY LATE GUARDIANS
DECLINING TO COMMIT HIMSELF TO THE FORMAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A SCHEME
IN A WORD I SAW IN THIS MISS HAVISHAM AS I HAD HER THEN AND THERE
BEFORE MY EYES AND ALWAYS HAD HAD HER BEFORE MY EYES AND I SAW IN
THIS THE DISTINCT SHADOW OF THE DARKENED AND UNHEALTHY HOUSE IN WHICH
HER LIFE WAS HIDDEN FROM THE SUN

THE CANDLES THAT LIGHTED THAT ROOM OF HERS WERE PLACED IN SCONCES ON
THE WALL THEY WERE HIGH FROM THE GROUND AND THEY BURNT WITH THE
STEADY DULNESS OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IN AIR THAT IS SELDOM RENEWED AS I
LOOKED ROUND AT THEM AND AT THE PALE GLOOM THEY MADE AND AT THE
STOPPED CLOCK AND AT THE WITHERED ARTICLES OF BRIDAL DRESS UPON THE
TABLE AND THE GROUND AND AT HER OWN AWFUL FIGURE WITH ITS GHOSTLY
REFLECTION THROWN LARGE BY THE FIRE UPON THE CEILING AND THE WALL I
SAW IN EVERYTHING THE CONSTRUCTION THAT MY MIND HAD COME TO REPEATED
AND THROWN BACK TO ME MY THOUGHTS PASSED INTO THE GREAT ROOM ACROSS
THE LANDING WHERE THE TABLE WAS SPREAD AND I SAW IT WRITTEN AS IT
WERE IN THE FALLS OF THE COBWEBS FROM THE CENTREPIECE IN THE
CRAWLINGS OF THE SPIDERS ON THE CLOTH IN THE TRACKS OF THE MICE AS
THEY BETOOK THEIR LITTLE QUICKENED HEARTS BEHIND THE PANELS AND IN THE
GROPINGS AND PAUSINGS OF THE BEETLES ON THE FLOOR

IT HAPPENED ON THE OCCASION OF THIS VISIT THAT SOME SHARP WORDS AROSE
BETWEEN ESTELLA AND MISS HAVISHAM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER
SEEN THEM OPPOSED

WE WERE SEATED BY THE FIRE AS JUST NOW DESCRIBED AND MISS HAVISHAM
STILL HAD ESTELLAS ARM DRAWN THROUGH HER OWN AND STILL CLUTCHED
ESTELLAS HAND IN HERS WHEN ESTELLA GRADUALLY BEGAN TO DETACH HERSELF
SHE HAD SHOWN A PROUD IMPATIENCE MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE AND HAD RATHER
ENDURED THAT FIERCE AFFECTION THAN ACCEPTED OR RETURNED IT

WHAT SAID MISS HAVISHAM FLASHING HER EYES UPON HER ARE YOU TIRED
OF ME

ONLY A LITTLE TIRED OF MYSELF REPLIED ESTELLA DISENGAGING HER ARM
AND MOVING TO THE GREAT CHIMNEYPIECE WHERE SHE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT
THE FIRE

SPEAK THE TRUTH YOU INGRATE CRIED MISS HAVISHAM PASSIONATELY
STRIKING HER STICK UPON THE FLOOR YOU ARE TIRED OF ME

ESTELLA LOOKED AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE AND AGAIN LOOKED DOWN AT
THE FIRE HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND HER BEAUTIFUL FACE EXPRESSED A
SELFPOSSESSED INDIFFERENCE TO THE WILD HEAT OF THE OTHER THAT WAS
ALMOST CRUEL

YOU STOCK AND STONE EXCLAIMED MISS HAVISHAM YOU COLD COLD HEART

WHAT SAID ESTELLA PRESERVING HER ATTITUDE OF INDIFFERENCE AS SHE
LEANED AGAINST THE GREAT CHIMNEYPIECE AND ONLY MOVING HER EYES DO
YOU REPROACH ME FOR BEING COLD YOU

ARE YOU NOT WAS THE FIERCE RETORT

YOU SHOULD KNOW SAID ESTELLA I AM WHAT YOU HAVE MADE ME TAKE ALL
THE PRAISE TAKE ALL THE BLAME TAKE ALL THE SUCCESS TAKE ALL THE
FAILURE IN SHORT TAKE ME

O LOOK AT HER LOOK AT HER CRIED MISS HAVISHAM BITTERLY LOOK AT
HER SO HARD AND THANKLESS ON THE HEARTH WHERE SHE WAS REARED WHERE I
TOOK HER INTO THIS WRETCHED BREAST WHEN IT WAS FIRST BLEEDING FROM ITS
STABS AND WHERE I HAVE LAVISHED YEARS OF TENDERNESS UPON HER

ILLUSTRATION

AT LEAST I WAS NO PARTY TO THE COMPACT SAID ESTELLA FOR IF I COULD
WALK AND SPEAK WHEN IT WAS MADE IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO BUT
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME AND I OWE
EVERYTHING TO YOU WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE

LOVE REPLIED THE OTHER

YOU HAVE IT

I HAVE NOT SAID MISS HAVISHAM

MOTHER BY ADOPTION RETORTED ESTELLA NEVER DEPARTING FROM THE EASY
GRACE OF HER ATTITUDE NEVER RAISING HER VOICE AS THE OTHER DID NEVER
YIELDING EITHER TO ANGER OR TENDERNESSMOTHER BY ADOPTION I HAVE
SAID THAT I OWE EVERYTHING TO YOU ALL I POSSESS IS FREELY YOURS ALL
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME IS AT YOUR COMMAND TO HAVE AGAIN BEYOND THAT
I HAVE NOTHING AND IF YOU ASK ME TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEVER GAVE ME
MY GRATITUDE AND DUTY CANNOT DO IMPOSSIBILITIES

DID I NEVER GIVE HER LOVE CRIED MISS HAVISHAM TURNING WILDLY TO ME
DID I NEVER GIVE HER A BURNING LOVE INSEPARABLE FROM JEALOUSY AT ALL
TIMES AND FROM SHARP PAIN WHILE SHE SPEAKS THUS TO ME LET HER CALL
ME MAD LET HER CALL ME MAD

WHY SHOULD I CALL YOU MAD RETURNED ESTELLA I OF ALL PEOPLE DOES
ANY ONE LIVE WHO KNOWS WHAT SET PURPOSES YOU HAVE HALF AS WELL AS I
DO DOES ANY ONE LIVE WHO KNOWS WHAT A STEADY MEMORY YOU HAVE HALF AS
WELL AS I DO I WHO HAVE SAT ON THIS SAME HEARTH ON THE LITTLE STOOL
THAT IS EVEN NOW BESIDE YOU THERE LEARNING YOUR LESSONS AND LOOKING UP
INTO YOUR FACE WHEN YOUR FACE WAS STRANGE AND FRIGHTENED ME

SOON FORGOTTEN MOANED MISS HAVISHAM TIMES SOON FORGOTTEN

NO NOT FORGOTTEN RETORTED ESTELLANOT FORGOTTEN BUT TREASURED UP
IN MY MEMORY WHEN HAVE YOU FOUND ME FALSE TO YOUR TEACHING WHEN HAVE
YOU FOUND ME UNMINDFUL OF YOUR LESSONS WHEN HAVE YOU FOUND ME GIVING
ADMISSION HERE SHE TOUCHED HER BOSOM WITH HER HAND TO ANYTHING THAT
YOU EXCLUDED BE JUST TO ME

SO PROUD SO PROUD MOANED MISS HAVISHAM PUSHING AWAY HER GREY HAIR
WITH BOTH HER HANDS

WHO TAUGHT ME TO BE PROUD RETURNED ESTELLA WHO PRAISED ME WHEN I
LEARNT MY LESSON

SO HARD SO HARD MOANED MISS HAVISHAM WITH HER FORMER ACTION

WHO TAUGHT ME TO BE HARD RETURNED ESTELLA WHO PRAISED ME WHEN I
LEARNT MY LESSON

BUT TO BE PROUD AND HARD TO ME MISS HAVISHAM QUITE SHRIEKED AS
SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS ESTELLA ESTELLA ESTELLA TO BE PROUD AND
HARD TO ME

ESTELLA LOOKED AT HER FOR A MOMENT WITH A KIND OF CALM WONDER BUT WAS
NOT OTHERWISE DISTURBED WHEN THE MOMENT WAS PAST SHE LOOKED DOWN AT
THE FIRE AGAIN

I CANNOT THINK SAID ESTELLA RAISING HER EYES AFTER A SILENCE WHY
YOU SHOULD BE SO UNREASONABLE WHEN I COME TO SEE YOU AFTER A
SEPARATION I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN YOUR WRONGS AND THEIR CAUSES I HAVE
NEVER BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO YOU OR YOUR SCHOOLING I HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY
WEAKNESS THAT I CAN CHARGE MYSELF WITH

WOULD IT BE WEAKNESS TO RETURN MY LOVE EXCLAIMED MISS HAVISHAM BUT
YES YES SHE WOULD CALL IT SO

I BEGIN TO THINK SAID ESTELLA IN A MUSING WAY AFTER ANOTHER MOMENT
OF CALM WONDER THAT I ALMOST UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COMES ABOUT IF YOU
HAD BROUGHT UP YOUR ADOPTED DAUGHTER WHOLLY IN THE DARK CONFINEMENT OF
THESE ROOMS AND HAD NEVER LET HER KNOW THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS
THE DAYLIGHT BY WHICH SHE HAD NEVER ONCE SEEN YOUR FACEIF YOU HAD
DONE THAT AND THEN FOR A PURPOSE HAD WANTED HER TO UNDERSTAND THE
DAYLIGHT AND KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND
ANGRY

MISS HAVISHAM WITH HER HEAD IN HER HANDS SAT MAKING A LOW MOANING
AND SWAYING HERSELF ON HER CHAIR BUT GAVE NO ANSWER

OR SAID ESTELLAWHICH IS A NEARER CASEIF YOU HAD TAUGHT HER
FROM THE DAWN OF HER INTELLIGENCE WITH YOUR UTMOST ENERGY AND MIGHT
THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS DAYLIGHT BUT THAT IT WAS MADE TO BE HER
ENEMY AND DESTROYER AND SHE MUST ALWAYS TURN AGAINST IT FOR IT HAD
BLIGHTED YOU AND WOULD ELSE BLIGHT HERIF YOU HAD DONE THIS AND THEN
FOR A PURPOSE HAD WANTED HER TO TAKE NATURALLY TO THE DAYLIGHT AND SHE
COULD NOT DO IT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY

MISS HAVISHAM SAT LISTENING OR IT SEEMED SO FOR I COULD NOT SEE HER
FACE BUT STILL MADE NO ANSWER

SO SAID ESTELLA I MUST BE TAKEN AS I HAVE BEEN MADE THE SUCCESS
IS NOT MINE THE FAILURE IS NOT MINE BUT THE TWO TOGETHER MAKE ME

MISS HAVISHAM HAD SETTLED DOWN I HARDLY KNEW HOW UPON THE FLOOR
AMONG THE FADED BRIDAL RELICS WITH WHICH IT WAS STREWN I TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENTI HAD SOUGHT ONE FROM THE FIRSTTO LEAVE THE
ROOM AFTER BESEECHING ESTELLAS ATTENTION TO HER WITH A MOVEMENT OF
MY HAND WHEN I LEFT ESTELLA WAS YET STANDING BY THE GREAT
CHIMNEYPIECE JUST AS SHE HAD STOOD THROUGHOUT MISS HAVISHAMS GREY
HAIR WAS ALL ADRIFT UPON THE GROUND AMONG THE OTHER BRIDAL WRECKS AND
WAS A MISERABLE SIGHT TO SEE

IT WAS WITH A DEPRESSED HEART THAT I WALKED IN THE STARLIGHT FOR AN
HOUR AND MORE ABOUT THE COURTYARD AND ABOUT THE BREWERY AND ABOUT
THE RUINED GARDEN WHEN I AT LAST TOOK COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE ROOM I
FOUND ESTELLA SITTING AT MISS HAVISHAMS KNEE TAKING UP SOME STITCHES
IN ONE OF THOSE OLD ARTICLES OF DRESS THAT WERE DROPPING TO PIECES AND
OF WHICH I HAVE OFTEN BEEN REMINDED SINCE BY THE FADED TATTERS OF OLD
BANNERS THAT I HAVE SEEN HANGING UP IN CATHEDRALS AFTERWARDS ESTELLA
AND I PLAYED AT CARDS AS OF YOREONLY WE WERE SKILFUL NOW AND PLAYED
FRENCH GAMESAND SO THE EVENING WORE AWAY AND I WENT TO BED

I LAY IN THAT SEPARATE BUILDING ACROSS THE COURTYARD IT WAS THE FIRST
TIME I HAD EVER LAIN DOWN TO REST IN SATIS HOUSE AND SLEEP REFUSED TO
COME NEAR ME A THOUSAND MISS HAVISHAMS HAUNTED ME SHE WAS ON THIS
SIDE OF MY PILLOW ON THAT AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AT THE FOOT BEHIND
THE HALFOPENED DOOR OF THE DRESSINGROOM IN THE DRESSINGROOM IN THE
ROOM OVERHEAD IN THE ROOM BENEATHEVERYWHERE AT LAST WHEN THE NIGHT
WAS SLOW TO CREEP ON TOWARDS TWO OCLOCK I FELT THAT I ABSOLUTELY
COULD NO LONGER BEAR THE PLACE AS A PLACE TO LIE DOWN IN AND THAT I
MUST GET UP I THEREFORE GOT UP AND PUT ON MY CLOTHES AND WENT OUT
ACROSS THE YARD INTO THE LONG STONE PASSAGE DESIGNING TO GAIN THE
OUTER COURTYARD AND WALK THERE FOR THE RELIEF OF MY MIND BUT I WAS NO
SOONER IN THE PASSAGE THAN I EXTINGUISHED MY CANDLE FOR I SAW MISS
HAVISHAM GOING ALONG IT IN A GHOSTLY MANNER MAKING A LOW CRY I
FOLLOWED HER AT A DISTANCE AND SAW HER GO UP THE STAIRCASE SHE
CARRIED A BARE CANDLE IN HER HAND WHICH SHE HAD PROBABLY TAKEN FROM
ONE OF THE SCONCES IN HER OWN ROOM AND WAS A MOST UNEARTHLY OBJECT BY
ITS LIGHT STANDING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE I FELT THE MILDEWED
AIR OF THE FEASTCHAMBER WITHOUT SEEING HER OPEN THE DOOR AND I HEARD
HER WALKING THERE AND SO ACROSS INTO HER OWN ROOM AND SO ACROSS AGAIN
INTO THAT NEVER CEASING THE LOW CRY AFTER A TIME I TRIED IN THE DARK
BOTH TO GET OUT AND TO GO BACK BUT I COULD DO NEITHER UNTIL SOME
STREAKS OF DAY STRAYED IN AND SHOWED ME WHERE TO LAY MY HANDS DURING
THE WHOLE INTERVAL WHENEVER I WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE I
HEARD HER FOOTSTEP SAW HER LIGHT PASS ABOVE AND HEARD HER CEASELESS
LOW CRY

BEFORE WE LEFT NEXT DAY THERE WAS NO REVIVAL OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HER AND ESTELLA NOR WAS IT EVER REVIVED ON ANY SIMILAR OCCASION AND
THERE WERE FOUR SIMILAR OCCASIONS TO THE BEST OF MY REMEMBRANCE NOR
DID MISS HAVISHAMS MANNER TOWARDS ESTELLA IN ANYWISE CHANGE EXCEPT
THAT I BELIEVED IT TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE FEAR INFUSED AMONG ITS FORMER
CHARACTERISTICS

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN THIS LEAF OF MY LIFE WITHOUT PUTTING BENTLEY
DRUMMLES NAME UPON IT OR I WOULD VERY GLADLY

ON A CERTAIN OCCASION WHEN THE FINCHES WERE ASSEMBLED IN FORCE AND
WHEN GOOD FEELING WAS BEING PROMOTED IN THE USUAL MANNER BY NOBODYS
AGREEING WITH ANYBODY ELSE THE PRESIDING FINCH CALLED THE GROVE TO
ORDER FORASMUCH AS MR DRUMMLE HAD NOT YET TOASTED A LADY WHICH
ACCORDING TO THE SOLEMN CONSTITUTION OF THE SOCIETY IT WAS THE BRUTES
TURN TO DO THAT DAY I THOUGHT I SAW HIM LEER IN AN UGLY WAY AT ME
WHILE THE DECANTERS WERE GOING ROUND BUT AS THERE WAS NO LOVE LOST
BETWEEN US THAT MIGHT EASILY BE WHAT WAS MY INDIGNANT SURPRISE WHEN
HE CALLED UPON THE COMPANY TO PLEDGE HIM TO ESTELLA

ESTELLA WHO SAID I

NEVER YOU MIND RETORTED DRUMMLE

ESTELLA OF WHERE SAID I YOU ARE BOUND TO SAY OF WHERE WHICH HE
WAS AS A FINCH

OF RICHMOND GENTLEMEN SAID DRUMMLE PUTTING ME OUT OF THE QUESTION
AND A PEERLESS BEAUTY

MUCH HE KNEW ABOUT PEERLESS BEAUTIES A MEAN MISERABLE IDIOT I
WHISPERED HERBERT

I KNOW THAT LADY SAID HERBERT ACROSS THE TABLE WHEN THE TOAST HAD
BEEN HONOURED

DO YOU SAID DRUMMLE

AND SO DO I I ADDED WITH A SCARLET FACE

DO YOU SAID DRUMMLE O LORD

THIS WAS THE ONLY RETORTEXCEPT GLASS OR CROCKERYTHAT THE HEAVY
CREATURE WAS CAPABLE OF MAKING BUT I BECAME AS HIGHLY INCENSED BY IT
AS IF IT HAD BEEN BARBED WITH WIT AND I IMMEDIATELY ROSE IN MY PLACE
AND SAID THAT I COULD NOT BUT REGARD IT AS BEING LIKE THE HONOURABLE
FINCHS IMPUDENCE TO COME DOWN TO THAT GROVEWE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT
COMING DOWN TO THAT GROVE AS A NEAT PARLIAMENTARY TURN OF
EXPRESSIONDOWN TO THAT GROVE PROPOSING A LADY OF WHOM HE KNEW
NOTHING MR DRUMMLE UPON THIS STARTING UP DEMANDED WHAT I MEANT BY
THAT WHEREUPON I MADE HIM THE EXTREME REPLY THAT I BELIEVED HE KNEW
WHERE I WAS TO BE FOUND

WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE IN A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY TO GET ON WITHOUT BLOOD
AFTER THIS WAS A QUESTION ON WHICH THE FINCHES WERE DIVIDED THE
DEBATE UPON IT GREW SO LIVELY INDEED THAT AT LEAST SIX MORE
HONOURABLE MEMBERS TOLD SIX MORE DURING THE DISCUSSION THAT THEY
BELIEVED THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE TO BE FOUND HOWEVER IT WAS
DECIDED AT LAST THE GROVE BEING A COURT OF HONOUR THAT IF MR DRUMMLE
WOULD BRING NEVER SO SLIGHT A CERTIFICATE FROM THE LADY IMPORTING THAT
HE HAD THE HONOUR OF HER ACQUAINTANCE MR PIP MUST EXPRESS HIS REGRET
AS A GENTLEMAN AND A FINCH FOR HAVING BEEN BETRAYED INTO A WARMTH
WHICH NEXT DAY WAS APPOINTED FOR THE PRODUCTION LEST OUR HONOUR
SHOULD TAKE COLD FROM DELAY AND NEXT DAY DRUMMLE APPEARED WITH A
POLITE LITTLE AVOWAL IN ESTELLAS HAND THAT SHE HAD HAD THE HONOUR OF
DANCING WITH HIM SEVERAL TIMES THIS LEFT ME NO COURSE BUT TO REGRET
THAT I HAD BEEN BETRAYED INTO A WARMTH WHICH AND ON THE WHOLE TO
REPUDIATE AS UNTENABLE THE IDEA THAT I WAS TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE
DRUMMLE AND I THEN SAT SNORTING AT ONE ANOTHER FOR AN HOUR WHILE THE
GROVE ENGAGED IN INDISCRIMINATE CONTRADICTION AND FINALLY THE
PROMOTION OF GOOD FEELING WAS DECLARED TO HAVE GONE AHEAD AT AN AMAZING
RATE

I TELL THIS LIGHTLY BUT IT WAS NO LIGHT THING TO ME FOR I CANNOT
ADEQUATELY EXPRESS WHAT PAIN IT GAVE ME TO THINK THAT ESTELLA SHOULD
SHOW ANY FAVOUR TO A CONTEMPTIBLE CLUMSY SULKY BOOBY SO VERY FAR
BELOW THE AVERAGE TO THE PRESENT MOMENT I BELIEVE IT TO HAVE BEEN
REFERABLE TO SOME PURE FIRE OF GENEROSITY AND DISINTERESTEDNESS IN MY
LOVE FOR HER THAT I COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT OF HER STOOPING TO
THAT HOUND NO DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE WHOMSOEVER SHE HAD
FAVOURED BUT A WORTHIER OBJECT WOULD HAVE CAUSED ME A DIFFERENT KIND
AND DEGREE OF DISTRESS

IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO FIND OUT AND I DID SOON FIND OUT THAT DRUMMLE
HAD BEGUN TO FOLLOW HER CLOSELY AND THAT SHE ALLOWED HIM TO DO IT A
LITTLE WHILE AND HE WAS ALWAYS IN PURSUIT OF HER AND HE AND I CROSSED
ONE ANOTHER EVERY DAY HE HELD ON IN A DULL PERSISTENT WAY AND
ESTELLA HELD HIM ON NOW WITH ENCOURAGEMENT NOW WITH DISCOURAGEMENT
NOW ALMOST FLATTERING HIM NOW OPENLY DESPISING HIM NOW KNOWING HIM
VERY WELL NOW SCARCELY REMEMBERING WHO HE WAS

THE SPIDER AS MR JAGGERS HAD CALLED HIM WAS USED TO LYING IN WAIT
HOWEVER AND HAD THE PATIENCE OF HIS TRIBE ADDED TO THAT HE HAD A
BLOCKHEAD CONFIDENCE IN HIS MONEY AND IN HIS FAMILY GREATNESS WHICH
SOMETIMES DID HIM GOOD SERVICEALMOST TAKING THE PLACE OF
CONCENTRATION AND DETERMINED PURPOSE SO THE SPIDER DOGGEDLY WATCHING
ESTELLA OUTWATCHED MANY BRIGHTER INSECTS AND WOULD OFTEN UNCOIL
HIMSELF AND DROP AT THE RIGHT NICK OF TIME

AT A CERTAIN ASSEMBLY BALL AT RICHMOND THERE USED TO BE ASSEMBLY BALLS
AT MOST PLACES THEN WHERE ESTELLA HAD OUTSHONE ALL OTHER BEAUTIES
THIS BLUNDERING DRUMMLE SO HUNG ABOUT HER AND WITH SO MUCH TOLERATION
ON HER PART THAT I RESOLVED TO SPEAK TO HER CONCERNING HIM I TOOK THE
NEXT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WAS WHEN SHE WAS WAITING FOR MRS BLANDLEY TO
TAKE HER HOME AND WAS SITTING APART AMONG SOME FLOWERS READY TO GO I
WAS WITH HER FOR I ALMOST ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED THEM TO AND FROM SUCH
PLACES

ARE YOU TIRED ESTELLA

RATHER PIP

YOU SHOULD BE

SAY RATHER I SHOULD NOT BE FOR I HAVE MY LETTER TO SATIS HOUSE TO
WRITE BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP

RECOUNTING TONIGHTS TRIUMPH SAID I SURELY A VERY POOR ONE
ESTELLA

WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DIDNT KNOW THERE HAD BEEN ANY

ESTELLA SAID I DO LOOK AT THAT FELLOW IN THE CORNER YONDER WHO IS
LOOKING OVER HERE AT US

WHY SHOULD I LOOK AT HIM RETURNED ESTELLA WITH HER EYES ON ME
INSTEAD WHAT IS THERE IN THAT FELLOW IN THE CORNER YONDERTO USE
YOUR WORDSTHAT I NEED LOOK AT

INDEED THAT IS THE VERY QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU SAID I FOR HE
HAS BEEN HOVERING ABOUT YOU ALL NIGHT

MOTHS AND ALL SORTS OF UGLY CREATURES REPLIED ESTELLA WITH A
GLANCE TOWARDS HIM HOVER ABOUT A LIGHTED CANDLE CAN THE CANDLE HELP
IT

NO I RETURNED BUT CANNOT THE ESTELLA HELP IT

WELL SAID SHE LAUGHING AFTER A MOMENT PERHAPS YES ANYTHING YOU
LIKE

BUT ESTELLA DO HEAR ME SPEAK IT MAKES ME WRETCHED THAT YOU SHOULD
ENCOURAGE A MAN SO GENERALLY DESPISED AS DRUMMLE YOU KNOW HE IS
DESPISED

WELL SAID SHE

YOU KNOW HE IS AS UNGAINLY WITHIN AS WITHOUT A DEFICIENT
ILLTEMPERED LOWERING STUPID FELLOW

WELL SAID SHE

YOU KNOW HE HAS NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HIM BUT MONEY AND A RIDICULOUS
ROLL OF ADDLEHEADED PREDECESSORS NOW DONT YOU

WELL SAID SHE AGAIN AND EACH TIME SHE SAID IT SHE OPENED HER
LOVELY EYES THE WIDER

TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING PAST THAT MONOSYLLABLE I TOOK IT
FROM HER AND SAID REPEATING IT WITH EMPHASIS WELL THEN THAT IS
WHY IT MAKES ME WRETCHED

NOW IF I COULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT SHE FAVOURED DRUMMLE WITH ANY IDEA
OF MAKING MEMEWRETCHED I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN BETTER HEART ABOUT IT
BUT IN THAT HABITUAL WAY OF HERS SHE PUT ME SO ENTIRELY OUT OF THE
QUESTION THAT I COULD BELIEVE NOTHING OF THE KIND

PIP SAID ESTELLA CASTING HER GLANCE OVER THE ROOM DONT BE
FOOLISH ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON YOU IT MAY HAVE ITS EFFECT ON OTHERS AND
MAY BE MEANT TO HAVE ITS NOT WORTH DISCUSSING

YES IT IS SAID I BECAUSE I CANNOT BEAR THAT PEOPLE SHOULD SAY
SHE THROWS AWAY HER GRACES AND ATTRACTIONS ON A MERE BOOR THE LOWEST
IN THE CROWD

I CAN BEAR IT SAID ESTELLA

OH DONT BE SO PROUD ESTELLA AND SO INFLEXIBLE

CALLS ME PROUD AND INFLEXIBLE IN THIS BREATH SAID ESTELLA OPENING
HER HANDS AND IN HIS LAST BREATH REPROACHED ME FOR STOOPING TO A
BOOR

THERE IS NO DOUBT YOU DO SAID I SOMETHING HURRIEDLY FOR I HAVE
SEEN YOU GIVE HIM LOOKS AND SMILES THIS VERY NIGHT SUCH AS YOU NEVER
GIVE TOME

DO YOU WANT ME THEN SAID ESTELLA TURNING SUDDENLY WITH A FIXED AND
SERIOUS IF NOT ANGRY LOOK TO DECEIVE AND ENTRAP YOU

DO YOU DECEIVE AND ENTRAP HIM ESTELLA

YES AND MANY OTHERSALL OF THEM BUT YOU HERE IS MRS BRANDLEY ILL
SAY NO MORE




AND NOW THAT I HAVE GIVEN THE ONE CHAPTER TO THE THEME THAT SO FILLED
MY HEART AND SO OFTEN MADE IT ACHE AND ACHE AGAIN I PASS ON
UNHINDERED TO THE EVENT THAT HAD IMPENDED OVER ME LONGER YET THE
EVENT THAT HAD BEGUN TO BE PREPARED FOR BEFORE I KNEW THAT THE WORLD
HELD ESTELLA AND IN THE DAYS WHEN HER BABY INTELLIGENCE WAS RECEIVING
ITS FIRST DISTORTIONS FROM MISS HAVISHAMS WASTING HANDS

IN THE EASTERN STORY THE HEAVY SLAB THAT WAS TO FALL ON THE BED OF
STATE IN THE FLUSH OF CONQUEST WAS SLOWLY WROUGHT OUT OF THE QUARRY
THE TUNNEL FOR THE ROPE TO HOLD IT IN ITS PLACE WAS SLOWLY CARRIED
THROUGH THE LEAGUES OF ROCK THE SLAB WAS SLOWLY RAISED AND FITTED IN
THE ROOF THE ROPE WAS ROVE TO IT AND SLOWLY TAKEN THROUGH THE MILES OF
HOLLOW TO THE GREAT IRON RING ALL BEING MADE READY WITH MUCH LABOUR
AND THE HOUR COME THE SULTAN WAS AROUSED IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND
THE SHARPENED AXE THAT WAS TO SEVER THE ROPE FROM THE GREAT IRON RING
WAS PUT INTO HIS HAND AND HE STRUCK WITH IT AND THE ROPE PARTED AND
RUSHED AWAY AND THE CEILING FELL SO IN MY CASE ALL THE WORK NEAR
AND AFAR THAT TENDED TO THE END HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND IN AN
INSTANT THE BLOW WAS STRUCK AND THE ROOF OF MY STRONGHOLD DROPPED UPON
ME




CHAPTER XXXIX


I WAS THREEANDTWENTY YEARS OF AGE NOT ANOTHER WORD HAD I HEARD TO
ENLIGHTEN ME ON THE SUBJECT OF MY EXPECTATIONS AND MY TWENTYTHIRD
BIRTHDAY WAS A WEEK GONE WE HAD LEFT BARNARDS INN MORE THAN A YEAR
AND LIVED IN THE TEMPLE OUR CHAMBERS WERE IN GARDENCOURT DOWN BY THE
RIVER

MR POCKET AND I HAD FOR SOME TIME PARTED COMPANY AS TO OUR ORIGINAL
RELATIONS THOUGH WE CONTINUED ON THE BEST TERMS NOTWITHSTANDING MY
INABILITY TO SETTLE TO ANYTHINGWHICH I HOPE AROSE OUT OF THE RESTLESS
AND INCOMPLETE TENURE ON WHICH I HELD MY MEANSI HAD A TASTE FOR
READING AND READ REGULARLY SO MANY HOURS A DAY THAT MATTER OF
HERBERTS WAS STILL PROGRESSING AND EVERYTHING WITH ME WAS AS I HAVE
BROUGHT IT DOWN TO THE CLOSE OF THE LAST PRECEDING CHAPTER

BUSINESS HAD TAKEN HERBERT ON A JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES I WAS ALONE AND
HAD A DULL SENSE OF BEING ALONE DISPIRITED AND ANXIOUS LONG HOPING
THAT TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK WOULD CLEAR MY WAY AND LONG DISAPPOINTED
I SADLY MISSED THE CHEERFUL FACE AND READY RESPONSE OF MY FRIEND

IT WAS WRETCHED WEATHER STORMY AND WET STORMY AND WET AND MUD MUD
MUD DEEP IN ALL THE STREETS DAY AFTER DAY A VAST HEAVY VEIL HAD BEEN
DRIVING OVER LONDON FROM THE EAST AND IT DROVE STILL AS IF IN THE
EAST THERE WERE AN ETERNITY OF CLOUD AND WIND SO FURIOUS HAD BEEN THE
GUSTS THAT HIGH BUILDINGS IN TOWN HAD HAD THE LEAD STRIPPED OFF THEIR
ROOFS AND IN THE COUNTRY TREES HAD BEEN TORN UP AND SAILS OF
WINDMILLS CARRIED AWAY AND GLOOMY ACCOUNTS HAD COME IN FROM THE COAST
OF SHIPWRECK AND DEATH VIOLENT BLASTS OF RAIN HAD ACCOMPANIED THESE
RAGES OF WIND AND THE DAY JUST CLOSED AS I SAT DOWN TO READ HAD BEEN
THE WORST OF ALL

ALTERATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT PART OF THE TEMPLE SINCE THAT TIME
AND IT HAS NOT NOW SO LONELY A CHARACTER AS IT HAD THEN NOR IS IT SO
EXPOSED TO THE RIVER WE LIVED AT THE TOP OF THE LAST HOUSE AND THE
WIND RUSHING UP THE RIVER SHOOK THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT LIKE DISCHARGES
OF CANNON OR BREAKINGS OF A SEA WHEN THE RAIN CAME WITH IT AND DASHED
AGAINST THE WINDOWS I THOUGHT RAISING MY EYES TO THEM AS THEY ROCKED
THAT I MIGHT HAVE FANCIED MYSELF IN A STORMBEATEN LIGHTHOUSE
OCCASIONALLY THE SMOKE CAME ROLLING DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS THOUGH IT
COULD NOT BEAR TO GO OUT INTO SUCH A NIGHT AND WHEN I SET THE DOORS
OPEN AND LOOKED DOWN THE STAIRCASE THE STAIRCASE LAMPS WERE BLOWN OUT
AND WHEN I SHADED MY FACE WITH MY HANDS AND LOOKED THROUGH THE BLACK
WINDOWS OPENING THEM EVER SO LITTLE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION IN THE
TEETH OF SUCH WIND AND RAIN I SAW THAT THE LAMPS IN THE COURT WERE
BLOWN OUT AND THAT THE LAMPS ON THE BRIDGES AND THE SHORE WERE
SHUDDERING AND THAT THE COALFIRES IN BARGES ON THE RIVER WERE BEING
CARRIED AWAY BEFORE THE WIND LIKE REDHOT SPLASHES IN THE RAIN

I READ WITH MY WATCH UPON THE TABLE PURPOSING TO CLOSE MY BOOK AT
ELEVEN OCLOCK AS I SHUT IT SAINT PAULS AND ALL THE MANY
CHURCHCLOCKS IN THE CITYSOME LEADING SOME ACCOMPANYING SOME
FOLLOWINGSTRUCK THAT HOUR THE SOUND WAS CURIOUSLY FLAWED BY THE WIND
AND I WAS LISTENING AND THINKING HOW THE WIND ASSAILED AND TORE IT
WHEN I HEARD A FOOTSTEP ON THE STAIR

WHAT NERVOUS FOLLY MADE ME START AND AWFULLY CONNECT IT WITH THE
FOOTSTEP OF MY DEAD SISTER MATTERS NOT IT WAS PAST IN A MOMENT AND I
LISTENED AGAIN AND HEARD THE FOOTSTEP STUMBLE IN COMING ON
REMEMBERING THEN THAT THE STAIRCASELIGHTS WERE BLOWN OUT I TOOK UP
MY READINGLAMP AND WENT OUT TO THE STAIRHEAD WHOEVER WAS BELOW HAD
STOPPED ON SEEING MY LAMP FOR ALL WAS QUIET

THERE IS SOME ONE DOWN THERE IS THERE NOT I CALLED OUT LOOKING
DOWN

YES SAID A VOICE FROM THE DARKNESS BENEATH

WHAT FLOOR DO YOU WANT

THE TOP MR PIP

THAT IS MY NAMETHERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER

NOTHING THE MATTER RETURNED THE VOICE AND THE MAN CAME ON

I STOOD WITH MY LAMP HELD OUT OVER THE STAIRRAIL AND HE CAME SLOWLY
WITHIN ITS LIGHT IT WAS A SHADED LAMP TO SHINE UPON A BOOK AND ITS
CIRCLE OF LIGHT WAS VERY CONTRACTED SO THAT HE WAS IN IT FOR A MERE
INSTANT AND THEN OUT OF IT IN THE INSTANT I HAD SEEN A FACE THAT WAS
STRANGE TO ME LOOKING UP WITH AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE AIR OF BEING TOUCHED
AND PLEASED BY THE SIGHT OF ME

MOVING THE LAMP AS THE MAN MOVED I MADE OUT THAT HE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY
DRESSED BUT ROUGHLY LIKE A VOYAGER BY SEA THAT HE HAD LONG IRONGREY
HAIR THAT HIS AGE WAS ABOUT SIXTY THAT HE WAS A MUSCULAR MAN STRONG
ON HIS LEGS AND THAT HE WAS BROWNED AND HARDENED BY EXPOSURE TO
WEATHER AS HE ASCENDED THE LAST STAIR OR TWO AND THE LIGHT OF MY LAMP
INCLUDED US BOTH I SAW WITH A STUPID KIND OF AMAZEMENT THAT HE WAS
HOLDING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS TO ME

PRAY WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS I ASKED HIM

MY BUSINESS HE REPEATED PAUSING AH YES I WILL EXPLAIN MY
BUSINESS BY YOUR LEAVE

DO YOU WISH TO COME IN

YES HE REPLIED I WISH TO COME IN MASTER

I HAD ASKED HIM THE QUESTION INHOSPITABLY ENOUGH FOR I RESENTED THE
SORT OF BRIGHT AND GRATIFIED RECOGNITION THAT STILL SHONE IN HIS FACE
I RESENTED IT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT HE EXPECTED ME TO
RESPOND TO IT BUT I TOOK HIM INTO THE ROOM I HAD JUST LEFT AND
HAVING SET THE LAMP ON THE TABLE ASKED HIM AS CIVILLY AS I COULD TO
EXPLAIN HIMSELF

HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH THE STRANGEST AIRAN AIR OF WONDERING
PLEASURE AS IF HE HAD SOME PART IN THE THINGS HE ADMIREDAND HE
PULLED OFF A ROUGH OUTER COAT AND HIS HAT THEN I SAW THAT HIS HEAD
WAS FURROWED AND BALD AND THAT THE LONG IRONGREY HAIR GREW ONLY ON
ITS SIDES BUT I SAW NOTHING THAT IN THE LEAST EXPLAINED HIM ON THE
CONTRARY I SAW HIM NEXT MOMENT ONCE MORE HOLDING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS
TO ME

WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID I HALF SUSPECTING HIM TO BE MAD

HE STOPPED IN HIS LOOKING AT ME AND SLOWLY RUBBED HIS RIGHT HAND OVER
HIS HEAD ITS DISAPINTING TO A MAN HE SAID IN A COARSE BROKEN
VOICE ARTER HAVING LOOKED FORARD SO DISTANT AND COME SO FUR BUT
YOURE NOT TO BLAME FOR THATNEITHER ON US IS TO BLAME FOR THAT ILL
SPEAK IN HALF A MINUTE GIVE ME HALF A MINUTE PLEASE

HE SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR THAT STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE AND COVERED HIS
FOREHEAD WITH HIS LARGE BROWN VEINOUS HANDS I LOOKED AT HIM
ATTENTIVELY THEN AND RECOILED A LITTLE FROM HIM BUT I DID NOT KNOW
HIM

THERES NO ONE NIGH SAID HE LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER IS THERE

WHY DO YOU A STRANGER COMING INTO MY ROOMS AT THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT
ASK THAT QUESTION SAID I

YOURE A GAME ONE HE RETURNED SHAKING HIS HEAD AT ME WITH A
DELIBERATE AFFECTION AT ONCE MOST UNINTELLIGIBLE AND MOST
EXASPERATING IM GLAD YOUVE GROWD UP A GAME ONE BUT DONT CATCH
HOLD OF ME YOUD BE SORRY ARTERWARDS TO HAVE DONE IT

I RELINQUISHED THE INTENTION HE HAD DETECTED FOR I KNEW HIM EVEN YET
I COULD NOT RECALL A SINGLE FEATURE BUT I KNEW HIM IF THE WIND AND
THE RAIN HAD DRIVEN AWAY THE INTERVENING YEARS HAD SCATTERED ALL THE
INTERVENING OBJECTS HAD SWEPT US TO THE CHURCHYARD WHERE WE FIRST
STOOD FACE TO FACE ON SUCH DIFFERENT LEVELS I COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN MY
CONVICT MORE DISTINCTLY THAN I KNEW HIM NOW AS HE SAT IN THE CHAIR
BEFORE THE FIRE NO NEED TO TAKE A FILE FROM HIS POCKET AND SHOW IT TO
ME NO NEED TO TAKE THE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS NECK AND TWIST IT ROUND
HIS HEAD NO NEED TO HUG HIMSELF WITH BOTH HIS ARMS AND TAKE A
SHIVERING TURN ACROSS THE ROOM LOOKING BACK AT ME FOR RECOGNITION I
KNEW HIM BEFORE HE GAVE ME ONE OF THOSE AIDS THOUGH A MOMENT BEFORE
I HAD NOT BEEN CONSCIOUS OF REMOTELY SUSPECTING HIS IDENTITY

HE CAME BACK TO WHERE I STOOD AND AGAIN HELD OUT BOTH HIS HANDS NOT
KNOWING WHAT TO DOFOR IN MY ASTONISHMENT I HAD LOST MY
SELFPOSSESSIONI RELUCTANTLY GAVE HIM MY HANDS HE GRASPED THEM
HEARTILY RAISED THEM TO HIS LIPS KISSED THEM AND STILL HELD THEM

YOU ACTED NOBLE MY BOY SAID HE NOBLE PIP AND I HAVE NEVER
FORGOT IT

AT A CHANGE IN HIS MANNER AS IF HE WERE EVEN GOING TO EMBRACE ME I
LAID A HAND UPON HIS BREAST AND PUT HIM AWAY

STAY SAID I KEEP OFF IF YOU ARE GRATEFUL TO ME FOR WHAT I DID
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE CHILD I HOPE YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR GRATITUDE BY
MENDING YOUR WAY OF LIFE IF YOU HAVE COME HERE TO THANK ME IT WAS NOT
NECESSARY STILL HOWEVER YOU HAVE FOUND ME OUT THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING GOOD IN THE FEELING THAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE AND I WILL NOT
REPULSE YOU BUT SURELY YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THATI

MY ATTENTION WAS SO ATTRACTED BY THE SINGULARITY OF HIS FIXED LOOK AT
ME THAT THE WORDS DIED AWAY ON MY TONGUE

YOU WAS ASAYING HE OBSERVED WHEN WE HAD CONFRONTED ONE ANOTHER IN
SILENCE THAT SURELY I MUST UNDERSTAND WHAT SURELY MUST I
UNDERSTAND

THAT I CANNOT WISH TO RENEW THAT CHANCE INTERCOURSE WITH YOU OF LONG
AGO UNDER THESE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES I AM GLAD TO BELIEVE YOU HAVE
REPENTED AND RECOVERED YOURSELF I AM GLAD TO TELL YOU SO I AM GLAD
THAT THINKING I DESERVE TO BE THANKED YOU HAVE COME TO THANK ME BUT
OUR WAYS ARE DIFFERENT WAYS NONE THE LESS YOU ARE WET AND YOU LOOK
WEARY WILL YOU DRINK SOMETHING BEFORE YOU GO

HE HAD REPLACED HIS NECKERCHIEF LOOSELY AND HAD STOOD KEENLY
OBSERVANT OF ME BITING A LONG END OF IT I THINK HE ANSWERED STILL
WITH THE END AT HIS MOUTH AND STILL OBSERVANT OF ME THAT I WILL
DRINK I THANK YOU AFORE I GO

THERE WAS A TRAY READY ON A SIDETABLE I BROUGHT IT TO THE TABLE NEAR
THE FIRE AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD HAVE HE TOUCHED ONE OF THE
BOTTLES WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT OR SPEAKING AND I MADE HIM SOME HOT RUM
AND WATER I TRIED TO KEEP MY HAND STEADY WHILE I DID SO BUT HIS LOOK
AT ME AS HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH THE LONG DRAGGLED END OF HIS
NECKERCHIEF BETWEEN HIS TEETHEVIDENTLY FORGOTTENMADE MY HAND VERY
DIFFICULT TO MASTER WHEN AT LAST I PUT THE GLASS TO HIM I SAW WITH
AMAZEMENT THAT HIS EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS

UP TO THIS TIME I HAD REMAINED STANDING NOT TO DISGUISE THAT I WISHED
HIM GONE BUT I WAS SOFTENED BY THE SOFTENED ASPECT OF THE MAN AND
FELT A TOUCH OF REPROACH I HOPE SAID I HURRIEDLY PUTTING SOMETHING
INTO A GLASS FOR MYSELF AND DRAWING A CHAIR TO THE TABLE THAT YOU
WILL NOT THINK I SPOKE HARSHLY TO YOU JUST NOW I HAD NO INTENTION OF
DOING IT AND I AM SORRY FOR IT IF I DID I WISH YOU WELL AND HAPPY

AS I PUT MY GLASS TO MY LIPS HE GLANCED WITH SURPRISE AT THE END OF
HIS NECKERCHIEF DROPPING FROM HIS MOUTH WHEN HE OPENED IT AND
STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND I GAVE HIM MINE AND THEN HE DRANK AND DREW
HIS SLEEVE ACROSS HIS EYES AND FOREHEAD

HOW ARE YOU LIVING I ASKED HIM

IVE BEEN A SHEEPFARMER STOCKBREEDER OTHER TRADES BESIDES AWAY IN
THE NEW WORLD SAID HE MANY A THOUSAND MILE OF STORMY WATER OFF FROM
THIS

I HOPE YOU HAVE DONE WELL

IVE DONE WONDERFULLY WELL THERES OTHERS WENT OUT ALONGER ME AS HAS
DONE WELL TOO BUT NO MAN HAS DONE NIGH AS WELL AS ME IM FAMOUS FOR
IT

I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT

I HOPE TO HEAR YOU SAY SO MY DEAR BOY

WITHOUT STOPPING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THOSE WORDS OR THE TONE IN WHICH
THEY WERE SPOKEN I TURNED OFF TO A POINT THAT HAD JUST COME INTO MY
MIND

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MESSENGER YOU ONCE SENT TO ME I INQUIRED
SINCE HE UNDERTOOK THAT TRUST

NEVER SET EYES UPON HIM I WARNT LIKELY TO IT

HE CAME FAITHFULLY AND HE BROUGHT ME THE TWO ONEPOUND NOTES I WAS A
POOR BOY THEN AS YOU KNOW AND TO A POOR BOY THEY WERE A LITTLE
FORTUNE BUT LIKE YOU I HAVE DONE WELL SINCE AND YOU MUST LET ME PAY
THEM BACK YOU CAN PUT THEM TO SOME OTHER POOR BOYS USE I TOOK OUT
MY PURSE

HE WATCHED ME AS I LAID MY PURSE UPON THE TABLE AND OPENED IT AND HE
WATCHED ME AS I SEPARATED TWO ONEPOUND NOTES FROM ITS CONTENTS THEY
WERE CLEAN AND NEW AND I SPREAD THEM OUT AND HANDED THEM OVER TO HIM
STILL WATCHING ME HE LAID THEM ONE UPON THE OTHER FOLDED THEM
LONGWISE GAVE THEM A TWIST SET FIRE TO THEM AT THE LAMP AND DROPPED
THE ASHES INTO THE TRAY

MAY I MAKE SO BOLD HE SAID THEN WITH A SMILE THAT WAS LIKE A FROWN
AND WITH A FROWN THAT WAS LIKE A SMILE AS ASK YOU HOW YOU HAVE DONE
WELL SINCE YOU AND ME WAS OUT ON THEM LONE SHIVERING MARSHES

HOW

AH

HE EMPTIED HIS GLASS GOT UP AND STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE FIRE WITH
HIS HEAVY BROWN HAND ON THE MANTELSHELF HE PUT A FOOT UP TO THE BARS
TO DRY AND WARM IT AND THE WET BOOT BEGAN TO STEAM BUT HE NEITHER
LOOKED AT IT NOR AT THE FIRE BUT STEADILY LOOKED AT ME IT WAS ONLY
NOW THAT I BEGAN TO TREMBLE

WHEN MY LIPS HAD PARTED AND HAD SHAPED SOME WORDS THAT WERE WITHOUT
SOUND I FORCED MYSELF TO TELL HIM THOUGH I COULD NOT DO IT
DISTINCTLY THAT I HAD BEEN CHOSEN TO SUCCEED TO SOME PROPERTY

MIGHT A MERE WARMINT ASK WHAT PROPERTY SAID HE

I FALTERED I DONT KNOW

MIGHT A MERE WARMINT ASK WHOSE PROPERTY SAID HE

I FALTERED AGAIN I DONT KNOW

COULD I MAKE A GUESS I WONDER SAID THE CONVICT AT YOUR INCOME
SINCE YOU COME OF AGE AS TO THE FIRST FIGURE NOW FIVE

WITH MY HEART BEATING LIKE A HEAVY HAMMER OF DISORDERED ACTION I ROSE
OUT OF MY CHAIR AND STOOD WITH MY HAND UPON THE BACK OF IT LOOKING
WILDLY AT HIM

CONCERNING A GUARDIAN HE WENT ON THERE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SOME
GUARDIAN OR SUCHLIKE WHILES YOU WAS A MINOR SOME LAWYER MAYBE AS
TO THE FIRST LETTER OF THAT LAWYERS NAME NOW WOULD IT BE J

ALL THE TRUTH OF MY POSITION CAME FLASHING ON ME AND ITS
DISAPPOINTMENTS DANGERS DISGRACES CONSEQUENCES OF ALL KINDS RUSHED
IN IN SUCH A MULTITUDE THAT I WAS BORNE DOWN BY THEM AND HAD TO
STRUGGLE FOR EVERY BREATH I DREW

PUT IT HE RESUMED AS THE EMPLOYER OF THAT LAWYER WHOSE NAME BEGUN

PORTSMOUTH AND HAD LANDED THERE AND HAD WANTED TO COME ON TO YOU

I FIND YOU OUT WHY I WROTE FROM PORTSMOUTH TO A PERSON IN LONDON FOR
PARTICULARS OF YOUR ADDRESS THAT PERSONS NAME WHY WEMMICK

I COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN ONE WORD THOUGH IT HAD BEEN TO SAVE MY LIFE I
STOOD WITH A HAND ON THE CHAIRBACK AND A HAND ON MY BREAST WHERE I

AGOING AND THIS WAY I HELD STEADY AFORE MY MIND THAT I WOULD FOR
CERTAIN COME ONE DAY AND SEE MY BOY AND MAKE MYSELF KNOWN TO HIM ON
HIS OWN GROUND

HE LAID HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT THAT FOR
ANYTHING I KNEW HIS HAND MIGHT BE STAINED WITH BLOOD

IT WARNT EASY PIP FOR ME TO LEAVE THEM PARTS NOR YET IT WARNT
SAFE BUT I HELD TO IT AND THE HARDER IT WAS THE STRONGER I HELD FOR
I WAS DETERMINED AND MY MIND FIRM MADE UP AT LAST I DONE IT DEAR
BOY I DONE IT

I TRIED TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS BUT I WAS STUNNED THROUGHOUT I HAD
SEEMED TO MYSELF TO ATTEND MORE TO THE WIND AND THE RAIN THAN TO HIM
EVEN NOW I COULD NOT SEPARATE HIS VOICE FROM THOSE VOICES THOUGH
THOSE WERE LOUD AND HIS WAS SILENT

WHERE WILL YOU PUT ME HE ASKED PRESENTLY I MUST BE PUT
SOMEWHERES DEAR BOY

TO SLEEP SAID I

YES AND TO SLEEP LONG AND SOUND HE ANSWERED FOR IVE BEEN
SEATOSSED AND SEAWASHED MONTHS AND MONTHS

MY FRIEND AND COMPANION SAID I RISING FROM THE SOFA IS ABSENT
YOU MUST HAVE HIS ROOM

HE WONT COME BACK TOMORROW WILL HE

NO SAID I ANSWERING ALMOST MECHANICALLY IN SPITE OF MY UTMOST
EFFORTS NOT TOMORROW

BECAUSE LOOKEE HERE DEAR BOY HE SAID DROPPING HIS VOICE AND
LAYING A LONG FINGER ON MY BREAST IN AN IMPRESSIVE MANNER CAUTION IS
NECESSARY

HOW DO YOU MEAN CAUTION

BY G ITS DEATH

WHATS DEATH

I WAS SENT FOR LIFE ITS DEATH TO COME BACK THERES BEEN OVERMUCH
COMING BACK OF LATE YEARS AND I SHOULD OF A CERTAINTY BE HANGED IF
TOOK

NOTHING WAS NEEDED BUT THIS THE WRETCHED MAN AFTER LOADING WRETCHED
ME WITH HIS GOLD AND SILVER CHAINS FOR YEARS HAD RISKED HIS LIFE TO
COME TO ME AND I HELD IT THERE IN MY KEEPING IF I HAD LOVED HIM
INSTEAD OF ABHORRING HIM IF I HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO HIM BY THE
STRONGEST ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION INSTEAD OF SHRINKING FROM HIM WITH
THE STRONGEST REPUGNANCE IT COULD HAVE BEEN NO WORSE ON THE CONTRARY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR HIS PRESERVATION WOULD THEN HAVE
NATURALLY AND TENDERLY ADDRESSED MY HEART

MY FIRST CARE WAS TO CLOSE THE SHUTTERS SO THAT NO LIGHT MIGHT BE SEEN
FROM WITHOUT AND THEN TO CLOSE AND MAKE FAST THE DOORS WHILE I DID
SO HE STOOD AT THE TABLE DRINKING RUM AND EATING BISCUIT AND WHEN I
SAW HIM THUS ENGAGED I SAW MY CONVICT ON THE MARSHES AT HIS MEAL
AGAIN IT ALMOST SEEMED TO ME AS IF HE MUST STOOP DOWN PRESENTLY TO
FILE AT HIS LEG

WHEN I HAD GONE INTO HERBERTS ROOM AND HAD SHUT OFF ANY OTHER
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN IT AND THE STAIRCASE THAN THROUGH THE ROOM IN
WHICH OUR CONVERSATION HAD BEEN HELD I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO TO
BED HE SAID YES BUT ASKED ME FOR SOME OF MY GENTLEMANS LINEN TO
PUT ON IN THE MORNING I BROUGHT IT OUT AND LAID IT READY FOR HIM AND
MY BLOOD AGAIN RAN COLD WHEN HE AGAIN TOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS TO GIVE ME
GOODNIGHT

I GOT AWAY FROM HIM WITHOUT KNOWING HOW I DID IT AND MENDED THE FIRE
IN THE ROOM WHERE WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER AND SAT DOWN BY IT AFRAID TO
GO TO BED FOR AN HOUR OR MORE I REMAINED TOO STUNNED TO THINK AND IT
WAS NOT UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK THAT I BEGAN FULLY TO KNOW HOW WRECKED
I WAS AND HOW THE SHIP IN WHICH I HAD SAILED WAS GONE TO PIECES

MISS HAVISHAMS INTENTIONS TOWARDS ME ALL A MERE DREAM ESTELLA NOT
DESIGNED FOR ME I ONLY SUFFERED IN SATIS HOUSE AS A CONVENIENCE A
STING FOR THE GREEDY RELATIONS A MODEL WITH A MECHANICAL HEART TO
PRACTISE ON WHEN NO OTHER PRACTICE WAS AT HAND THOSE WERE THE FIRST
SMARTS I HAD BUT SHARPEST AND DEEPEST PAIN OF ALLIT WAS FOR THE
CONVICT GUILTY OF I KNEW NOT WHAT CRIMES AND LIABLE TO BE TAKEN OUT
OF THOSE ROOMS WHERE I SAT THINKING AND HANGED AT THE OLD BAILEY DOOR
THAT I HAD DESERTED JOE

I WOULD NOT HAVE GONE BACK TO JOE NOW I WOULD NOT HAVE GONE BACK TO
BIDDY NOW FOR ANY CONSIDERATION SIMPLY I SUPPOSE BECAUSE MY SENSE
OF MY OWN WORTHLESS CONDUCT TO THEM WAS GREATER THAN EVERY
CONSIDERATION NO WISDOM ON EARTH COULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE COMFORT THAT
I SHOULD HAVE DERIVED FROM THEIR SIMPLICITY AND FIDELITY BUT I COULD
NEVER NEVER UNDO WHAT I HAD DONE

IN EVERY RAGE OF WIND AND RUSH OF RAIN I HEARD PURSUERS TWICE I
COULD HAVE SWORN THERE WAS A KNOCKING AND WHISPERING AT THE OUTER DOOR
WITH THESE FEARS UPON ME I BEGAN EITHER TO IMAGINE OR RECALL THAT I
HAD HAD MYSTERIOUS WARNINGS OF THIS MANS APPROACH THAT FOR WEEKS
GONE BY I HAD PASSED FACES IN THE STREETS WHICH I HAD THOUGHT LIKE
HIS THAT THESE LIKENESSES HAD GROWN MORE NUMEROUS AS HE COMING OVER
THE SEA HAD DRAWN NEARER THAT HIS WICKED SPIRIT HAD SOMEHOW SENT
THESE MESSENGERS TO MINE AND THAT NOW ON THIS STORMY NIGHT HE WAS AS
GOOD AS HIS WORD AND WITH ME

CROWDING UP WITH THESE REFLECTIONS CAME THE REFLECTION THAT I HAD SEEN
HIM WITH MY CHILDISH EYES TO BE A DESPERATELY VIOLENT MAN THAT I HAD
HEARD THAT OTHER CONVICT REITERATE THAT HE HAD TRIED TO MURDER HIM
THAT I HAD SEEN HIM DOWN IN THE DITCH TEARING AND FIGHTING LIKE A WILD
BEAST OUT OF SUCH REMEMBRANCES I BROUGHT INTO THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE A
HALFFORMED TERROR THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE SAFE TO BE SHUT UP THERE WITH
HIM IN THE DEAD OF THE WILD SOLITARY NIGHT THIS DILATED UNTIL IT
FILLED THE ROOM AND IMPELLED ME TO TAKE A CANDLE AND GO IN AND LOOK AT
MY DREADFUL BURDEN

HE HAD ROLLED A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE WAS SET AND
LOWERING IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE WAS ASLEEP AND QUIETLY TOO THOUGH HE
HAD A PISTOL LYING ON THE PILLOW ASSURED OF THIS I SOFTLY REMOVED THE
KEY TO THE OUTSIDE OF HIS DOOR AND TURNED IT ON HIM BEFORE I AGAIN SAT
DOWN BY THE FIRE GRADUALLY I SLIPPED FROM THE CHAIR AND LAY ON THE
FLOOR WHEN I AWOKE WITHOUT HAVING PARTED IN MY SLEEP WITH THE
PERCEPTION OF MY WRETCHEDNESS THE CLOCKS OF THE EASTWARD CHURCHES WERE
STRIKING FIVE THE CANDLES WERE WASTED OUT THE FIRE WAS DEAD AND THE
WIND AND RAIN INTENSIFIED THE THICK BLACK DARKNESS

THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIPS EXPECTATIONS




CHAPTER XL


IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR ME THAT I HAD TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO ENSURE SO
FAR AS I COULD THE SAFETY OF MY DREADED VISITOR FOR THIS THOUGHT
PRESSING ON ME WHEN I AWOKE HELD OTHER THOUGHTS IN A CONFUSED
CONCOURSE AT A DISTANCE

THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM CONCEALED IN THE CHAMBERS WAS
SELFEVIDENT IT COULD NOT BE DONE AND THE ATTEMPT TO DO IT WOULD
INEVITABLY ENGENDER SUSPICION TRUE I HAD NO AVENGER IN MY SERVICE
NOW BUT I WAS LOOKED AFTER BY AN INFLAMMATORY OLD FEMALE ASSISTED BY
AN ANIMATED RAGBAG WHOM SHE CALLED HER NIECE AND TO KEEP A ROOM
SECRET FROM THEM WOULD BE TO INVITE CURIOSITY AND EXAGGERATION THEY
BOTH HAD WEAK EYES WHICH I HAD LONG ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR CHRONICALLY
LOOKING IN AT KEYHOLES AND THEY WERE ALWAYS AT HAND WHEN NOT WANTED
INDEED THAT WAS THEIR ONLY RELIABLE QUALITY BESIDES LARCENY NOT TO GET
UP A MYSTERY WITH THESE PEOPLE I RESOLVED TO ANNOUNCE IN THE MORNING
THAT MY UNCLE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY COME FROM THE COUNTRY

THIS COURSE I DECIDED ON WHILE I WAS YET GROPING ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS
FOR THE MEANS OF GETTING A LIGHT NOT STUMBLING ON THE MEANS AFTER ALL
I WAS FAIN TO GO OUT TO THE ADJACENT LODGE AND GET THE WATCHMAN THERE
TO COME WITH HIS LANTERN NOW IN GROPING MY WAY DOWN THE BLACK
STAIRCASE I FELL OVER SOMETHING AND THAT SOMETHING WAS A MAN CROUCHING
IN A CORNER

AS THE MAN MADE NO ANSWER WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID THERE BUT
ELUDED MY TOUCH IN SILENCE I RAN TO THE LODGE AND URGED THE WATCHMAN
TO COME QUICKLY TELLING HIM OF THE INCIDENT ON THE WAY BACK THE WIND
BEING AS FIERCE AS EVER WE DID NOT CARE TO ENDANGER THE LIGHT IN THE
LANTERN BY REKINDLING THE EXTINGUISHED LAMPS ON THE STAIRCASE BUT WE
EXAMINED THE STAIRCASE FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP AND FOUND NO ONE
THERE IT THEN OCCURRED TO ME AS POSSIBLE THAT THE MAN MIGHT HAVE
SLIPPED INTO MY ROOMS SO LIGHTING MY CANDLE AT THE WATCHMANS AND
LEAVING HIM STANDING AT THE DOOR I EXAMINED THEM CAREFULLY INCLUDING
THE ROOM IN WHICH MY DREADED GUEST LAY ASLEEP ALL WAS QUIET AND
ASSUREDLY NO OTHER MAN WAS IN THOSE CHAMBERS

IT TROUBLED ME THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LURKER ON THE STAIRS ON
THAT NIGHT OF ALL NIGHTS IN THE YEAR AND I ASKED THE WATCHMAN ON THE
CHANCE OF ELICITING SOME HOPEFUL EXPLANATION AS I HANDED HIM A DRAM AT
THE DOOR WHETHER HE HAD ADMITTED AT HIS GATE ANY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD
PERCEPTIBLY BEEN DINING OUT YES HE SAID AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE
NIGHT THREE ONE LIVED IN FOUNTAIN COURT AND THE OTHER TWO LIVED IN
THE LANE AND HE HAD SEEN THEM ALL GO HOME AGAIN THE ONLY OTHER MAN
WHO DWELT IN THE HOUSE OF WHICH MY CHAMBERS FORMED A PART HAD BEEN IN
THE COUNTRY FOR SOME WEEKS AND HE CERTAINLY HAD NOT RETURNED IN THE
NIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD SEEN HIS DOOR WITH HIS SEAL ON IT AS WE CAME
UPSTAIRS

THE NIGHT BEING SO BAD SIR SAID THE WATCHMAN AS HE GAVE ME BACK MY
GLASS UNCOMMON FEW HAVE COME IN AT MY GATE BESIDES THEM THREE
GENTLEMEN THAT I HAVE NAMED I DONT CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SINCE ABOUT
ELEVEN OCLOCK WHEN A STRANGER ASKED FOR YOU

MY UNCLE I MUTTERED YES

YOU SAW HIM SIR

YES OH YES

LIKEWISE THE PERSON WITH HIM

PERSON WITH HIM I REPEATED

I JUDGED THE PERSON TO BE WITH HIM RETURNED THE WATCHMAN THE
PERSON STOPPED WHEN HE STOPPED TO MAKE INQUIRY OF ME AND THE PERSON
TOOK THIS WAY WHEN HE TOOK THIS WAY

WHAT SORT OF PERSON

THE WATCHMAN HAD NOT PARTICULARLY NOTICED HE SHOULD SAY A WORKING
PERSON TO THE BEST OF HIS BELIEF HE HAD A DUSTCOLOURED KIND OF
CLOTHES ON UNDER A DARK COAT THE WATCHMAN MADE MORE LIGHT OF THE
MATTER THAN I DID AND NATURALLY NOT HAVING MY REASON FOR ATTACHING
WEIGHT TO IT

WHEN I HAD GOT RID OF HIM WHICH I THOUGHT IT WELL TO DO WITHOUT
PROLONGING EXPLANATIONS MY MIND WAS MUCH TROUBLED BY THESE TWO
CIRCUMSTANCES TAKEN TOGETHER WHEREAS THEY WERE EASY OF INNOCENT
SOLUTION APARTAS FOR INSTANCE SOME DINER OUT OR DINER AT HOME WHO
HAD NOT GONE NEAR THIS WATCHMANS GATE MIGHT HAVE STRAYED TO MY
STAIRCASE AND DROPPED ASLEEP THEREAND MY NAMELESS VISITOR MIGHT HAVE
BROUGHT SOME ONE WITH HIM TO SHOW HIM THE WAYSTILL JOINED THEY HAD
AN UGLY LOOK TO ONE AS PRONE TO DISTRUST AND FEAR AS THE CHANGES OF A
FEW HOURS HAD MADE ME

I LIGHTED MY FIRE WHICH BURNT WITH A RAW PALE FLARE AT THAT TIME OF
THE MORNING AND FELL INTO A DOZE BEFORE IT I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
DOZING A WHOLE NIGHT WHEN THE CLOCKS STRUCK SIX AS THERE WAS FULL AN
HOUR AND A HALF BETWEEN ME AND DAYLIGHT I DOZED AGAIN NOW WAKING UP
UNEASILY WITH PROLIX CONVERSATIONS ABOUT NOTHING IN MY EARS NOW
MAKING THUNDER OF THE WIND IN THE CHIMNEY AT LENGTH FALLING OFF INTO
A PROFOUND SLEEP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT WOKE ME WITH A START

ALL THIS TIME I HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONSIDER MY OWN SITUATION NOR
COULD I DO SO YET I HAD NOT THE POWER TO ATTEND TO IT I WAS GREATLY
DEJECTED AND DISTRESSED BUT IN AN INCOHERENT WHOLESALE SORT OF WAY AS
TO FORMING ANY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE I COULD AS SOON HAVE FORMED AN
ELEPHANT WHEN I OPENED THE SHUTTERS AND LOOKED OUT AT THE WET WILD
MORNING ALL OF A LEADEN HUE WHEN I WALKED FROM ROOM TO ROOM WHEN I
SAT DOWN AGAIN SHIVERING BEFORE THE FIRE WAITING FOR MY LAUNDRESS TO
APPEAR I THOUGHT HOW MISERABLE I WAS BUT HARDLY KNEW WHY OR HOW LONG
I HAD BEEN SO OR ON WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK I MADE THE REFLECTION OR
EVEN WHO I WAS THAT MADE IT

AT LAST THE OLD WOMAN AND THE NIECE CAME INTHE LATTER WITH A HEAD
NOT EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM HER DUSTY BROOMAND TESTIFIED SURPRISE
AT SIGHT OF ME AND THE FIRE TO WHOM I IMPARTED HOW MY UNCLE HAD COME
IN THE NIGHT AND WAS THEN ASLEEP AND HOW THE BREAKFAST PREPARATIONS
WERE TO BE MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY THEN I WASHED AND DRESSED WHILE THEY
KNOCKED THE FURNITURE ABOUT AND MADE A DUST AND SO IN A SORT OF DREAM
OR SLEEPWAKING I FOUND MYSELF SITTING BY THE FIRE AGAIN WAITING
FORHIMTO COME TO BREAKFAST

BY AND BY HIS DOOR OPENED AND HE CAME OUT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO
BEAR THE SIGHT OF HIM AND I THOUGHT HE HAD A WORSE LOOK BY DAYLIGHT

I DO NOT EVEN KNOW SAID I SPEAKING LOW AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT AT THE
TABLE BY WHAT NAME TO CALL YOU I HAVE GIVEN OUT THAT YOU ARE MY
UNCLE

THATS IT DEAR BOY CALL ME UNCLE

YOU ASSUMED SOME NAME I SUPPOSE ON BOARD SHIP

YES DEAR BOY I TOOK THE NAME OF PROVIS

ANOTHER

WHAT IS YOUR REAL NAME I ASKED HIM IN A WHISPER

MAGWITCH HE ANSWERED IN THE SAME TONE CHRISEND ABEL

WHAT WERE YOU BROUGHT UP TO BE

A WARMINT DEAR BOY

HE ANSWERED QUITE SERIOUSLY AND USED THE WORD AS IF IT DENOTED SOME
PROFESSION

WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE TEMPLE LAST NIGHT SAID I PAUSING TO WONDER
WHETHER THAT COULD REALLY HAVE BEEN LAST NIGHT WHICH SEEMED SO LONG
AGO

YES DEAR BOY

WHEN YOU CAME IN AT THE GATE AND ASKED THE WATCHMAN THE WAY HERE HAD
YOU ANY ONE WITH YOU

WITH ME NO DEAR BOY

BUT THERE WAS SOME ONE THERE

I DIDNT TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE HE SAID DUBIOUSLY NOT KNOWING THE
WAYS OF THE PLACE BUT I THINK THERE WAS A PERSON TOO COME IN
ALONGER ME

IT WAS ON MY LIPS TO ASK HIM WHAT HE WAS TRIED FOR BUT HE TOOK UP A
KNIFE GAVE IT A FLOURISH AND WITH THE WORDS AND WHAT I DONE IS
WORKED OUT AND PAID FOR FELL TO AT HIS BREAKFAST

HE ATE IN A RAVENOUS WAY THAT WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE AND ALL HIS
ACTIONS WERE UNCOUTH NOISY AND GREEDY SOME OF HIS TEETH HAD FAILED
HIM SINCE I SAW HIM EAT ON THE MARSHES AND AS HE TURNED HIS FOOD IN
HIS MOUTH AND TURNED HIS HEAD SIDEWAYS TO BRING HIS STRONGEST FANGS TO
BEAR UPON IT HE LOOKED TERRIBLY LIKE A HUNGRY OLD DOG IF I HAD BEGUN
WITH ANY APPETITE HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY AND I SHOULD HAVE SAT
MUCH AS I DIDREPELLED FROM HIM BY AN INSURMOUNTABLE AVERSION AND
GLOOMILY LOOKING AT THE CLOTH

IM A HEAVY GRUBBER DEAR BOY HE SAID AS A POLITE KIND OF APOLOGY
WHEN HE MADE AN END OF HIS MEAL BUT I ALWAYS WAS IF IT HAD BEEN IN
MY CONSTITUTION TO BE A LIGHTER GRUBBER I MIGHT HA GOT INTO LIGHTER
TROUBLE SIMILARLY I MUST HAVE MY SMOKE WHEN I WAS FIRST HIRED OUT AS
SHEPHERD TOTHER SIDE THE WORLD ITS MY BELIEF I SHOULD HA TURNED
INTO A MOLLONCOLLYMAD SHEEP MYSELF IF I HADNT A HAD MY SMOKE

AS HE SAID SO HE GOT UP FROM TABLE AND PUTTING HIS HAND INTO THE
BREAST OF THE PEACOAT HE WORE BROUGHT OUT A SHORT BLACK PIPE AND A
HANDFUL OF LOOSE TOBACCO OF THE KIND THAT IS CALLED NEGROHEAD HAVING
FILLED HIS PIPE HE PUT THE SURPLUS TOBACCO BACK AGAIN AS IF HIS
POCKET WERE A DRAWER THEN HE TOOK A LIVE COAL FROM THE FIRE WITH THE
TONGS AND LIGHTED HIS PIPE AT IT AND THEN TURNED ROUND ON THE
HEARTHRUG WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE AND WENT THROUGH HIS FAVOURITE
ACTION OF HOLDING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS FOR MINE

AND THIS SAID HE DANDLING MY HANDS UP AND DOWN IN HIS AS HE PUFFED
AT HIS PIPEAND THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN WHAT I MADE THE REAL GENUINE
ONE IT DOES ME GOOD FUR TO LOOK AT YOU PIP ALL I STIPLATE IS TO
STAND BY AND LOOK AT YOU DEAR BOY

I RELEASED MY HANDS AS SOON AS I COULD AND FOUND THAT I WAS BEGINNING
SLOWLY TO SETTLE DOWN TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF MY CONDITION WHAT I WAS
CHAINED TO AND HOW HEAVILY BECAME INTELLIGIBLE TO ME AS I HEARD HIS
HOARSE VOICE AND SAT LOOKING UP AT HIS FURROWED BALD HEAD WITH ITS
IRON GREY HAIR AT THE SIDES

I MUSTNT SEE MY GENTLEMAN A FOOTING IT IN THE MIRE OF THE STREETS
THERE MUSTNT BE NO MUD ON HIS BOOTS MY GENTLEMAN MUST HAVE HORSES
PIP HORSES TO RIDE AND HORSES TO DRIVE AND HORSES FOR HIS SERVANT TO

AFEERD TO PERCH UPON A SCARECROW IF THERES DEATH HID INSIDE OF IT
THERE IS AND LET HIM COME OUT AND ILL FACE HIM AND THEN ILL
BELIEVE IN HIM AND NOT AFORE AND NOW LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT MY
GENTLEMAN AGEN

ONCE MORE HE TOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS AND SURVEYED ME WITH AN AIR OF
ADMIRING PROPRIETORSHIP SMOKING WITH GREAT COMPLACENCY ALL THE WHILE

IT APPEARED TO ME THAT I COULD DO NO BETTER THAN SECURE HIM SOME QUIET
LODGING HARD BY OF WHICH HE MIGHT TAKE POSSESSION WHEN HERBERT
RETURNED WHOM I EXPECTED IN TWO OR THREE DAYS THAT THE SECRET MUST BE
CONFIDED TO HERBERT AS A MATTER OF UNAVOIDABLE NECESSITY EVEN IF I
COULD HAVE PUT THE IMMENSE RELIEF I SHOULD DERIVE FROM SHARING IT WITH
HIM OUT OF THE QUESTION WAS PLAIN TO ME BUT IT WAS BY NO MEANS SO
PLAIN TO MR PROVIS I RESOLVED TO CALL HIM BY THAT NAME WHO RESERVED
HIS CONSENT TO HERBERTS PARTICIPATION UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM
AND FORMED A FAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OF HIS PHYSIOGNOMY AND EVEN THEN
DEAR BOY SAID HE PULLING A GREASY LITTLE CLASPED BLACK TESTAMENT OUT
OF HIS POCKET WELL HAVE HIM ON HIS OATH

TO STATE THAT MY TERRIBLE PATRON CARRIED THIS LITTLE BLACK BOOK ABOUT
THE WORLD SOLELY TO SWEAR PEOPLE ON IN CASES OF EMERGENCY WOULD BE TO
STATE WHAT I NEVER QUITE ESTABLISHED BUT THIS I CAN SAY THAT I NEVER
KNEW HIM PUT IT TO ANY OTHER USE THE BOOK ITSELF HAD THE APPEARANCE OF
HAVING BEEN STOLEN FROM SOME COURT OF JUSTICE AND PERHAPS HIS
KNOWLEDGE OF ITS ANTECEDENTS COMBINED WITH HIS OWN EXPERIENCE IN THAT
WISE GAVE HIM A RELIANCE ON ITS POWERS AS A SORT OF LEGAL SPELL OR
CHARM ON THIS FIRST OCCASION OF HIS PRODUCING IT I RECALLED HOW HE
HAD MADE ME SWEAR FIDELITY IN THE CHURCHYARD LONG AGO AND HOW HE HAD
DESCRIBED HIMSELF LAST NIGHT AS ALWAYS SWEARING TO HIS RESOLUTIONS IN
HIS SOLITUDE

AS HE WAS AT PRESENT DRESSED IN A SEAFARING SLOP SUIT IN WHICH HE
LOOKED AS IF HE HAD SOME PARROTS AND CIGARS TO DISPOSE OF I NEXT
DISCUSSED WITH HIM WHAT DRESS HE SHOULD WEAR HE CHERISHED AN
EXTRAORDINARY BELIEF IN THE VIRTUES OF SHORTS AS A DISGUISE AND HAD
IN HIS OWN MIND SKETCHED A DRESS FOR HIMSELF THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HIM
SOMETHING BETWEEN A DEAN AND A DENTIST IT WAS WITH CONSIDERABLE
DIFFICULTY THAT I WON HIM OVER TO THE ASSUMPTION OF A DRESS MORE LIKE A
PROSPEROUS FARMERS AND WE ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CUT HIS HAIR CLOSE
AND WEAR A LITTLE POWDER LASTLY AS HE HAD NOT YET BEEN SEEN BY THE
LAUNDRESS OR HER NIECE HE WAS TO KEEP HIMSELF OUT OF THEIR VIEW UNTIL
HIS CHANGE OF DRESS WAS MADE

IT WOULD SEEM A SIMPLE MATTER TO DECIDE ON THESE PRECAUTIONS BUT IN MY
DAZED NOT TO SAY DISTRACTED STATE IT TOOK SO LONG THAT I DID NOT
GET OUT TO FURTHER THEM UNTIL TWO OR THREE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS TO
REMAIN SHUT UP IN THE CHAMBERS WHILE I WAS GONE AND WAS ON NO ACCOUNT
TO OPEN THE DOOR

THERE BEING TO MY KNOWLEDGE A RESPECTABLE LODGINGHOUSE IN ESSEX
STREET THE BACK OF WHICH LOOKED INTO THE TEMPLE AND WAS ALMOST WITHIN
HAIL OF MY WINDOWS I FIRST OF ALL REPAIRED TO THAT HOUSE AND WAS SO
FORTUNATE AS TO SECURE THE SECOND FLOOR FOR MY UNCLE MR PROVIS I
THEN WENT FROM SHOP TO SHOP MAKING SUCH PURCHASES AS WERE NECESSARY TO
THE CHANGE IN HIS APPEARANCE THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTED I TURNED MY
FACE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT TO LITTLE BRITAIN MR JAGGERS WAS AT HIS
DESK BUT SEEING ME ENTER GOT UP IMMEDIATELY AND STOOD BEFORE HIS
FIRE

NOW PIP SAID HE BE CAREFUL

I WILL SIR I RETURNED FOR COMING ALONG I HAD THOUGHT WELL OF WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY

DONT COMMIT YOURSELF SAID MR JAGGERS AND DONT COMMIT ANY ONE
YOU UNDERSTANDANY ONE DONT TELL ME ANYTHING I DONT WANT TO KNOW
ANYTHING I AM NOT CURIOUS

OF COURSE I SAW THAT HE KNEW THE MAN WAS COME

I MERELY WANT MR JAGGERS SAID I TO ASSURE MYSELF THAT WHAT I
HAVE BEEN TOLD IS TRUE I HAVE NO HOPE OF ITS BEING UNTRUE BUT AT
LEAST I MAY VERIFY IT

MR JAGGERS NODDED BUT DID YOU SAY TOLD OR INFORMED HE ASKED
ME WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND NOT LOOKING AT ME BUT LOOKING IN A
LISTENING WAY AT THE FLOOR TOLD WOULD SEEM TO IMPLY VERBAL
COMMUNICATION YOU CANT HAVE VERBAL COMMUNICATION WITH A MAN IN NEW
SOUTH WALES YOU KNOW

I WILL SAY INFORMED MR JAGGERS

GOOD

I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY A PERSON NAMED ABEL MAGWITCH THAT HE IS THE
BENEFACTOR SO LONG UNKNOWN TO ME

THAT IS THE MAN SAID MR JAGGERS IN NEW SOUTH WALES

AND ONLY HE SAID I

AND ONLY HE SAID MR JAGGERS

I AM NOT SO UNREASONABLE SIR AS TO THINK YOU AT ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR
MY MISTAKES AND WRONG CONCLUSIONS BUT I ALWAYS SUPPOSED IT WAS MISS
HAVISHAM

COOLLY AND TAKING A BITE AT HIS FOREFINGER I AM NOT AT ALL

EVERYTHING ON EVIDENCE THERES NO BETTER RULE

A LITTLE WHILE I HAVE VERIFIED MY INFORMATION AND THERES AN END

AND MAGWITCHIN NEW SOUTH WALESHAVING AT LAST DISCLOSED HIMSELF
SAID MR JAGGERS YOU WILL COMPREHEND PIP HOW RIGIDLY THROUGHOUT MY
COMMUNICATION WITH YOU I HAVE ALWAYS ADHERED TO THE STRICT LINE OF
FACT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THE LEAST DEPARTURE FROM THE STRICT LINE OF
FACT YOU ARE QUITE AWARE OF THAT

QUITE SIR

I COMMUNICATED TO MAGWITCHIN NEW SOUTH WALESWHEN HE FIRST WROTE TO
MEFROM NEW SOUTH WALESTHE CAUTION THAT HE MUST NOT EXPECT ME EVER TO
DEVIATE FROM THE STRICT LINE OF FACT I ALSO COMMUNICATED TO HIM
ANOTHER CAUTION HE APPEARED TO ME TO HAVE OBSCURELY HINTED IN HIS
LETTER AT SOME DISTANT IDEA HE HAD OF SEEING YOU IN ENGLAND HERE I
CAUTIONED HIM THAT I MUST HEAR NO MORE OF THAT THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL
LIKELY TO OBTAIN A PARDON THAT HE WAS EXPATRIATED FOR THE TERM OF HIS
NATURAL LIFE AND THAT HIS PRESENTING HIMSELF IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE
AN ACT OF FELONY RENDERING HIM LIABLE TO THE EXTREME PENALTY OF THE
LAW I GAVE MAGWITCH THAT CAUTION SAID MR JAGGERS LOOKING HARD AT
ME I WROTE IT TO NEW SOUTH WALES HE GUIDED HIMSELF BY IT NO DOUBT

NO DOUBT SAID I

I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY WEMMICK PURSUED MR JAGGERS STILL LOOKING
HARD AT ME THAT HE HAS RECEIVED A LETTER UNDER DATE PORTSMOUTH FROM
A COLONIST OF THE NAME OF PURVIS OR

OR PROVIS I SUGGESTED

OR PROVISTHANK YOU PIP PERHAPS IT IS PROVIS PERHAPS YOU KNOW
ITS PROVIS

YES SAID I

YOU KNOW ITS PROVIS A LETTER UNDER DATE PORTSMOUTH FROM A COLONIST
OF THE NAME OF PROVIS ASKING FOR THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR ADDRESS ON
BEHALF OF MAGWITCH WEMMICK SENT HIM THE PARTICULARS I UNDERSTAND BY
RETURN OF POST PROBABLY IT IS THROUGH PROVIS THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED
THE EXPLANATION OF MAGWITCHIN NEW SOUTH WALES

IT CAME THROUGH PROVIS I REPLIED

GOOD DAY PIP SAID MR JAGGERS OFFERING HIS HAND GLAD TO HAVE
SEEN YOU IN WRITING BY POST TO MAGWITCHIN NEW SOUTH WALESOR IN
COMMUNICATING WITH HIM THROUGH PROVIS HAVE THE GOODNESS TO MENTION
THAT THE PARTICULARS AND VOUCHERS OF OUR LONG ACCOUNT SHALL BE SENT TO
YOU TOGETHER WITH THE BALANCE FOR THERE IS STILL A BALANCE REMAINING
GOODDAY PIP

WE SHOOK HANDS AND HE LOOKED HARD AT ME AS LONG AS HE COULD SEE ME I
TURNED AT THE DOOR AND HE WAS STILL LOOKING HARD AT ME WHILE THE TWO
VILE CASTS ON THE SHELF SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO GET THEIR EYELIDS OPEN
AND TO FORCE OUT OF THEIR SWOLLEN THROATS O WHAT A MAN HE IS

WEMMICK WAS OUT AND THOUGH HE HAD BEEN AT HIS DESK HE COULD HAVE DONE
NOTHING FOR ME I WENT STRAIGHT BACK TO THE TEMPLE WHERE I FOUND THE
TERRIBLE PROVIS DRINKING RUM AND WATER AND SMOKING NEGROHEAD IN
SAFETY

NEXT DAY THE CLOTHES I HAD ORDERED ALL CAME HOME AND HE PUT THEM ON
WHATEVER HE PUT ON BECAME HIM LESS IT DISMALLY SEEMED TO ME THAN
WHAT HE HAD WORN BEFORE TO MY THINKING THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIM
THAT MADE IT HOPELESS TO ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE HIM THE MORE I DRESSED
HIM AND THE BETTER I DRESSED HIM THE MORE HE LOOKED LIKE THE SLOUCHING
FUGITIVE ON THE MARSHES THIS EFFECT ON MY ANXIOUS FANCY WAS PARTLY
REFERABLE NO DOUBT TO HIS OLD FACE AND MANNER GROWING MORE FAMILIAR
TO ME BUT I BELIEVE TOO THAT HE DRAGGED ONE OF HIS LEGS AS IF THERE
WERE STILL A WEIGHT OF IRON ON IT AND THAT FROM HEAD TO FOOT THERE WAS
CONVICT IN THE VERY GRAIN OF THE MAN

THE INFLUENCES OF HIS SOLITARY HUTLIFE WERE UPON HIM BESIDES AND GAVE
HIM A SAVAGE AIR THAT NO DRESS COULD TAME ADDED TO THESE WERE THE
INFLUENCES OF HIS SUBSEQUENT BRANDED LIFE AMONG MEN AND CROWNING ALL
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS DODGING AND HIDING NOW IN ALL HIS WAYS
OF SITTING AND STANDING AND EATING AND DRINKINGOF BROODING ABOUT IN
A HIGHSHOULDERED RELUCTANT STYLEOF TAKING OUT HIS GREAT HORNHANDLED
JACKKNIFE AND WIPING IT ON HIS LEGS AND CUTTING HIS FOODOF LIFTING
LIGHT GLASSES AND CUPS TO HIS LIPS AS IF THEY WERE CLUMSY
PANNIKINSOF CHOPPING A WEDGE OFF HIS BREAD AND SOAKING UP WITH IT
THE LAST FRAGMENTS OF GRAVY ROUND AND ROUND HIS PLATE AS IF TO MAKE
THE MOST OF AN ALLOWANCE AND THEN DRYING HIS FINGERENDS ON IT AND
THEN SWALLOWING ITIN THESE WAYS AND A THOUSAND OTHER SMALL NAMELESS
INSTANCES ARISING EVERY MINUTE IN THE DAY THERE WAS PRISONER FELON
BONDSMAN PLAIN AS PLAIN COULD BE

IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN IDEA TO WEAR THAT TOUCH OF POWDER AND I HAD
CONCEDED THE POWDER AFTER OVERCOMING THE SHORTS BUT I CAN COMPARE THE
EFFECT OF IT WHEN ON TO NOTHING BUT THE PROBABLE EFFECT OF ROUGE UPON
THE DEAD SO AWFUL WAS THE MANNER IN WHICH EVERYTHING IN HIM THAT IT
WAS MOST DESIRABLE TO REPRESS STARTED THROUGH THAT THIN LAYER OF
PRETENCE AND SEEMED TO COME BLAZING OUT AT THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD IT
WAS ABANDONED AS SOON AS TRIED AND HE WORE HIS GRIZZLED HAIR CUT
SHORT

WORDS CANNOT TELL WHAT A SENSE I HAD AT THE SAME TIME OF THE DREADFUL
MYSTERY THAT HE WAS TO ME WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP OF AN EVENING WITH HIS
KNOTTED HANDS CLENCHING THE SIDES OF THE EASYCHAIR AND HIS BALD HEAD
TATTOOED WITH DEEP WRINKLES FALLING FORWARD ON HIS BREAST I WOULD SIT
AND LOOK AT HIM WONDERING WHAT HE HAD DONE AND LOADING HIM WITH ALL
THE CRIMES IN THE CALENDAR UNTIL THE IMPULSE WAS POWERFUL ON ME TO
START UP AND FLY FROM HIM EVERY HOUR SO INCREASED MY ABHORRENCE OF
HIM THAT I EVEN THINK I MIGHT HAVE YIELDED TO THIS IMPULSE IN THE
FIRST AGONIES OF BEING SO HAUNTED NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HE HAD DONE FOR
ME AND THE RISK HE RAN BUT FOR THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HERBERT MUST SOON
COME BACK ONCE I ACTUALLY DID START OUT OF BED IN THE NIGHT AND
BEGIN TO DRESS MYSELF IN MY WORST CLOTHES HURRIEDLY INTENDING TO LEAVE
HIM THERE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE I POSSESSED AND ENLIST FOR INDIA AS A
PRIVATE SOLDIER

I DOUBT IF A GHOST COULD HAVE BEEN MORE TERRIBLE TO ME UP IN THOSE
LONELY ROOMS IN THE LONG EVENINGS AND LONG NIGHTS WITH THE WIND AND
THE RAIN ALWAYS RUSHING BY A GHOST COULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND
HANGED ON MY ACCOUNT AND THE CONSIDERATION THAT HE COULD BE AND THE
DREAD THAT HE WOULD BE WERE NO SMALL ADDITION TO MY HORRORS WHEN HE
WAS NOT ASLEEP OR PLAYING A COMPLICATED KIND OF PATIENCE WITH A RAGGED
PACK OF CARDS OF HIS OWNA GAME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE OR SINCE AND
IN WHICH HE RECORDED HIS WINNINGS BY STICKING HIS JACKKNIFE INTO THE
TABLEWHEN HE WAS NOT ENGAGED IN EITHER OF THESE PURSUITS HE WOULD
ASK ME TO READ TO HIMFOREIGN LANGUAGE DEAR BOY WHILE I COMPLIED
HE NOT COMPREHENDING A SINGLE WORD WOULD STAND BEFORE THE FIRE
SURVEYING ME WITH THE AIR OF AN EXHIBITOR AND I WOULD SEE HIM BETWEEN
THE FINGERS OF THE HAND WITH WHICH I SHADED MY FACE APPEALING IN DUMB
SHOW TO THE FURNITURE TO TAKE NOTICE OF MY PROFICIENCY THE IMAGINARY
STUDENT PURSUED BY THE MISSHAPEN CREATURE HE HAD IMPIOUSLY MADE WAS
NOT MORE WRETCHED THAN I PURSUED BY THE CREATURE WHO HAD MADE ME AND
RECOILING FROM HIM WITH A STRONGER REPULSION THE MORE HE ADMIRED ME
AND THE FONDER HE WAS OF ME

THIS IS WRITTEN OF I AM SENSIBLE AS IF IT HAD LASTED A YEAR IT
LASTED ABOUT FIVE DAYS EXPECTING HERBERT ALL THE TIME I DARED NOT GO
OUT EXCEPT WHEN I TOOK PROVIS FOR AN AIRING AFTER DARK AT LENGTH ONE
EVENING WHEN DINNER WAS OVER AND I HAD DROPPED INTO A SLUMBER QUITE
WORN OUTFOR MY NIGHTS HAD BEEN AGITATED AND MY REST BROKEN BY FEARFUL
DREAMSI WAS ROUSED BY THE WELCOME FOOTSTEP ON THE STAIRCASE PROVIS
WHO HAD BEEN ASLEEP TOO STAGGERED UP AT THE NOISE I MADE AND IN AN
INSTANT I SAW HIS JACKKNIFE SHINING IN HIS HAND

QUIET ITS HERBERT I SAID AND HERBERT CAME BURSTING IN WITH THE
AIRY FRESHNESS OF SIX HUNDRED MILES OF FRANCE UPON HIM

HANDEL MY DEAR FELLOW HOW ARE YOU AND AGAIN HOW ARE YOU AND AGAIN
HOW ARE YOU I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN GONE A TWELVEMONTH WHY SO I MUST
HAVE BEEN FOR YOU HAVE GROWN QUITE THIN AND PALE HANDEL MYHALLOA I
BEG YOUR PARDON

HE WAS STOPPED IN HIS RUNNING ON AND IN HIS SHAKING HANDS WITH ME BY
SEEING PROVIS PROVIS REGARDING HIM WITH A FIXED ATTENTION WAS SLOWLY
PUTTING UP HIS JACKKNIFE AND GROPING IN ANOTHER POCKET FOR SOMETHING
ELSE

HERBERT MY DEAR FRIEND SAID I SHUTTING THE DOUBLE DOORS WHILE
HERBERT STOOD STARING AND WONDERING SOMETHING VERY STRANGE HAS
HAPPENED THIS ISA VISITOR OF MINE

ITS ALL RIGHT DEAR BOY SAID PROVIS COMING FORWARD WITH HIS LITTLE
CLASPED BLACK BOOK AND THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HERBERT TAKE IT IN
YOUR RIGHT HAND LORD STRIKE YOU DEAD ON THE SPOT IF EVER YOU SPLIT IN
ANY WAY SUMEVER KISS IT

DO SO AS HE WISHES IT I SAID TO HERBERT SO HERBERT LOOKING AT ME
WITH A FRIENDLY UNEASINESS AND AMAZEMENT COMPLIED AND PROVIS
IMMEDIATELY SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM SAID NOW YOURE ON YOUR OATH YOU
KNOW AND NEVER BELIEVE ME ON MINE IF PIP SHANT MAKE A GENTLEMAN ON
YOU




CHAPTER XLI


IN VAIN SHOULD I ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE ASTONISHMENT AND DISQUIET OF
HERBERT WHEN HE AND I AND PROVIS SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE AND I
RECOUNTED THE WHOLE OF THE SECRET ENOUGH THAT I SAW MY OWN FEELINGS
REFLECTED IN HERBERTS FACE AND NOT LEAST AMONG THEM MY REPUGNANCE
TOWARDS THE MAN WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR ME

WHAT WOULD ALONE HAVE SET A DIVISION BETWEEN THAT MAN AND US IF THERE
HAD BEEN NO OTHER DIVIDING CIRCUMSTANCE WAS HIS TRIUMPH IN MY STORY
SAVING HIS TROUBLESOME SENSE OF HAVING BEEN LOW ON ONE OCCASION SINCE
HIS RETURNON WHICH POINT HE BEGAN TO HOLD FORTH TO HERBERT THE
MOMENT MY REVELATION WAS FINISHEDHE HAD NO PERCEPTION OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF MY FINDING ANY FAULT WITH MY GOOD FORTUNE HIS BOAST
THAT HE HAD MADE ME A GENTLEMAN AND THAT HE HAD COME TO SEE ME SUPPORT
THE CHARACTER ON HIS AMPLE RESOURCES WAS MADE FOR ME QUITE AS MUCH AS
FOR HIMSELF AND THAT IT WAS A HIGHLY AGREEABLE BOAST TO BOTH OF US
AND THAT WE MUST BOTH BE VERY PROUD OF IT WAS A CONCLUSION QUITE
ESTABLISHED IN HIS OWN MIND

THOUGH LOOKEE HERE PIPS COMRADE HE SAID TO HERBERT AFTER HAVING
DISCOURSED FOR SOME TIME I KNOW VERY WELL THAT ONCE SINCE I COME
BACKFOR HALF A MINUTEIVE BEEN LOW I SAID TO PIP I KNOWED AS I HAD
BEEN LOW BUT DONT YOU FRET YOURSELF ON THAT SCORE I AINT MADE PIP A
GENTLEMAN AND PIP AINT AGOING TO MAKE YOU A GENTLEMAN NOT FUR ME
NOT TO KNOW WHATS DUE TO YE BOTH DEAR BOY AND PIPS COMRADE YOU TWO
MAY COUNT UPON ME ALWAYS HAVING A GENTEEL MUZZLE ON MUZZLED I HAVE
BEEN SINCE THAT HALF A MINUTE WHEN I WAS BETRAYED INTO LOWNESS MUZZLED
I AM AT THE PRESENT TIME MUZZLED I EVER WILL BE

HERBERT SAID CERTAINLY BUT LOOKED AS IF THERE WERE NO SPECIFIC
CONSOLATION IN THIS AND REMAINED PERPLEXED AND DISMAYED WE WERE
ANXIOUS FOR THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD GO TO HIS LODGING AND LEAVE US
TOGETHER BUT HE WAS EVIDENTLY JEALOUS OF LEAVING US TOGETHER AND SAT
LATE IT WAS MIDNIGHT BEFORE I TOOK HIM ROUND TO ESSEX STREET AND SAW
HIM SAFELY IN AT HIS OWN DARK DOOR WHEN IT CLOSED UPON HIM I
EXPERIENCED THE FIRST MOMENT OF RELIEF I HAD KNOWN SINCE THE NIGHT OF
HIS ARRIVAL

NEVER QUITE FREE FROM AN UNEASY REMEMBRANCE OF THE MAN ON THE STAIRS I
HAD ALWAYS LOOKED ABOUT ME IN TAKING MY GUEST OUT AFTER DARK AND IN
BRINGING HIM BACK AND I LOOKED ABOUT ME NOW DIFFICULT AS IT IS IN A
LARGE CITY TO AVOID THE SUSPICION OF BEING WATCHED WHEN THE MIND IS
CONSCIOUS OF DANGER IN THAT REGARD I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT
ANY OF THE PEOPLE WITHIN SIGHT CARED ABOUT MY MOVEMENTS THE FEW WHO
WERE PASSING PASSED ON THEIR SEVERAL WAYS AND THE STREET WAS EMPTY
WHEN I TURNED BACK INTO THE TEMPLE NOBODY HAD COME OUT AT THE GATE
WITH US NOBODY WENT IN AT THE GATE WITH ME AS I CROSSED BY THE
FOUNTAIN I SAW HIS LIGHTED BACK WINDOWS LOOKING BRIGHT AND QUIET AND
WHEN I STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN THE DOORWAY OF THE BUILDING WHERE I
LIVED BEFORE GOING UP THE STAIRS GARDEN COURT WAS AS STILL AND
LIFELESS AS THE STAIRCASE WAS WHEN I ASCENDED IT

HERBERT RECEIVED ME WITH OPEN ARMS AND I HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE SO
BLESSEDLY WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A FRIEND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN SOME SOUND
WORDS OF SYMPATHY AND ENCOURAGEMENT WE SAT DOWN TO CONSIDER THE
QUESTION WHAT WAS TO BE DONE

THE CHAIR THAT PROVIS HAD OCCUPIED STILL REMAINING WHERE IT HAD
STOODFOR HE HAD A BARRACK WAY WITH HIM OF HANGING ABOUT ONE SPOT IN
ONE UNSETTLED MANNER AND GOING THROUGH ONE ROUND OF OBSERVANCES WITH
HIS PIPE AND HIS NEGROHEAD AND HIS JACKKNIFE AND HIS PACK OF CARDS
AND WHAT NOT AS IF IT WERE ALL PUT DOWN FOR HIM ON A SLATEI SAY HIS
CHAIR REMAINING WHERE IT HAD STOOD HERBERT UNCONSCIOUSLY TOOK IT BUT
NEXT MOMENT STARTED OUT OF IT PUSHED IT AWAY AND TOOK ANOTHER HE HAD
NO OCCASION TO SAY AFTER THAT THAT HE HAD CONCEIVED AN AVERSION FOR MY
PATRON NEITHER HAD I OCCASION TO CONFESS MY OWN WE INTERCHANGED THAT
CONFIDENCE WITHOUT SHAPING A SYLLABLE

WHAT SAID I TO HERBERT WHEN HE WAS SAFE IN ANOTHER CHAIRWHAT IS
TO BE DONE

MY POOR DEAR HANDEL HE REPLIED HOLDING HIS HEAD I AM TOO STUNNED
TO THINK

SO WAS I HERBERT WHEN THE BLOW FIRST FELL STILL SOMETHING MUST BE
DONE HE IS INTENT UPON VARIOUS NEW EXPENSESHORSES AND CARRIAGES
AND LAVISH APPEARANCES OF ALL KINDS HE MUST BE STOPPED SOMEHOW

YOU MEAN THAT YOU CANT ACCEPT

HOW CAN I I INTERPOSED AS HERBERT PAUSED THINK OF HIM LOOK AT
HIM

AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER PASSED OVER BOTH OF US

YET I AM AFRAID THE DREADFUL TRUTH IS HERBERT THAT HE IS ATTACHED TO
ME STRONGLY ATTACHED TO ME WAS THERE EVER SUCH A FATE

MY POOR DEAR HANDEL HERBERT REPEATED

THEN SAID I AFTER ALL STOPPING SHORT HERE NEVER TAKING ANOTHER
PENNY FROM HIM THINK WHAT I OWE HIM ALREADY THEN AGAIN I AM HEAVILY
IN DEBTVERY HEAVILY FOR ME WHO HAVE NOW NO EXPECTATIONSAND I HAVE
BEEN BRED TO NO CALLING AND I AM FIT FOR NOTHING

WELL WELL WELL HERBERT REMONSTRATED DONT SAY FIT FOR NOTHING

WHAT AM I FIT FOR I KNOW ONLY ONE THING THAT I AM FIT FOR AND THAT
IS TO GO FOR A SOLDIER AND I MIGHT HAVE GONE MY DEAR HERBERT BUT
FOR THE PROSPECT OF TAKING COUNSEL WITH YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION

OF COURSE I BROKE DOWN THERE AND OF COURSE HERBERT BEYOND SEIZING A
WARM GRIP OF MY HAND PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW IT

ANYHOW MY DEAR HANDEL SAID HE PRESENTLY SOLDIERING WONT DO IF
YOU WERE TO RENOUNCE THIS PATRONAGE AND THESE FAVOURS I SUPPOSE YOU
WOULD DO SO WITH SOME FAINT HOPE OF ONE DAY REPAYING WHAT YOU HAVE
ALREADY HAD NOT VERY STRONG THAT HOPE IF YOU WENT SOLDIERING
BESIDES ITS ABSURD YOU WOULD BE INFINITELY BETTER IN CLARRIKERS
HOUSE SMALL AS IT IS I AM WORKING UP TOWARDS A PARTNERSHIP YOU
KNOW

POOR FELLOW HE LITTLE SUSPECTED WITH WHOSE MONEY

BUT THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION SAID HERBERT THIS IS AN IGNORANT
DETERMINED MAN WHO HAS LONG HAD ONE FIXED IDEA MORE THAN THAT HE
SEEMS TO ME I MAY MISJUDGE HIM TO BE A MAN OF A DESPERATE AND FIERCE
CHARACTER

I KNOW HE IS I RETURNED LET ME TELL YOU WHAT EVIDENCE I HAVE SEEN
OF IT AND I TOLD HIM WHAT I HAD NOT MENTIONED IN MY NARRATIVE OF
THAT ENCOUNTER WITH THE OTHER CONVICT

SEE THEN SAID HERBERT THINK OF THIS HE COMES HERE AT THE PERIL
OF HIS LIFE FOR THE REALISATION OF HIS FIXED IDEA IN THE MOMENT OF
REALISATION AFTER ALL HIS TOIL AND WAITING YOU CUT THE GROUND FROM
UNDER HIS FEET DESTROY HIS IDEA AND MAKE HIS GAINS WORTHLESS TO HIM
DO YOU SEE NOTHING THAT HE MIGHT DO UNDER THE DISAPPOINTMENT

I HAVE SEEN IT HERBERT AND DREAMED OF IT EVER SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT
OF HIS ARRIVAL NOTHING HAS BEEN IN MY THOUGHTS SO DISTINCTLY AS HIS
PUTTING HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF BEING TAKEN

THEN YOU MAY RELY UPON IT SAID HERBERT THAT THERE WOULD BE GREAT
DANGER OF HIS DOING IT THAT IS HIS POWER OVER YOU AS LONG AS HE
REMAINS IN ENGLAND AND THAT WOULD BE HIS RECKLESS COURSE IF YOU
FORSOOK HIM

I WAS SO STRUCK BY THE HORROR OF THIS IDEA WHICH HAD WEIGHED UPON ME
FROM THE FIRST AND THE WORKING OUT OF WHICH WOULD MAKE ME REGARD
MYSELF IN SOME SORT AS HIS MURDERER THAT I COULD NOT REST IN MY
CHAIR BUT BEGAN PACING TO AND FRO I SAID TO HERBERT MEANWHILE THAT
EVEN IF PROVIS WERE RECOGNISED AND TAKEN IN SPITE OF HIMSELF I SHOULD
BE WRETCHED AS THE CAUSE HOWEVER INNOCENTLY YES EVEN THOUGH I WAS SO
WRETCHED IN HAVING HIM AT LARGE AND NEAR ME AND EVEN THOUGH I WOULD
FAR RATHER HAVE WORKED AT THE FORGE ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE THAN I
WOULD EVER HAVE COME TO THIS

BUT THERE WAS NO STAVING OFF THE QUESTION WHAT WAS TO BE DONE

THE FIRST AND THE MAIN THING TO BE DONE SAID HERBERT IS TO GET HIM
OUT OF ENGLAND YOU WILL HAVE TO GO WITH HIM AND THEN HE MAY BE
INDUCED TO GO

BUT GET HIM WHERE I WILL COULD I PREVENT HIS COMING BACK

MY GOOD HANDEL IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT WITH NEWGATE IN THE NEXT
STREET THERE MUST BE FAR GREATER HAZARD IN YOUR BREAKING YOUR MIND TO
HIM AND MAKING HIM RECKLESS HERE THAN ELSEWHERE IF A PRETEXT TO GET
HIM AWAY COULD BE MADE OUT OF THAT OTHER CONVICT OR OUT OF ANYTHING
ELSE IN HIS LIFE NOW

THERE AGAIN SAID I STOPPING BEFORE HERBERT WITH MY OPEN HANDS
HELD OUT AS IF THEY CONTAINED THE DESPERATION OF THE CASE I KNOW
NOTHING OF HIS LIFE IT HAS ALMOST MADE ME MAD TO SIT HERE OF A NIGHT
AND SEE HIM BEFORE ME SO BOUND UP WITH MY FORTUNES AND MISFORTUNES
AND YET SO UNKNOWN TO ME EXCEPT AS THE MISERABLE WRETCH WHO TERRIFIED
ME TWO DAYS IN MY CHILDHOOD

HERBERT GOT UP AND LINKED HIS ARM IN MINE AND WE SLOWLY WALKED TO AND
FRO TOGETHER STUDYING THE CARPET

HANDEL SAID HERBERT STOPPING YOU FEEL CONVINCED THAT YOU CAN TAKE
NO FURTHER BENEFITS FROM HIM DO YOU

FULLY SURELY YOU WOULD TOO IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE

AND YOU FEEL CONVINCED THAT YOU MUST BREAK WITH HIM

HERBERT CAN YOU ASK ME

AND YOU HAVE AND ARE BOUND TO HAVE THAT TENDERNESS FOR THE LIFE HE
HAS RISKED ON YOUR ACCOUNT THAT YOU MUST SAVE HIM IF POSSIBLE FROM
THROWING IT AWAY THEN YOU MUST GET HIM OUT OF ENGLAND BEFORE YOU STIR
A FINGER TO EXTRICATE YOURSELF THAT DONE EXTRICATE YOURSELF IN
HEAVENS NAME AND WELL SEE IT OUT TOGETHER DEAR OLD BOY

IT WAS A COMFORT TO SHAKE HANDS UPON IT AND WALK UP AND DOWN AGAIN
WITH ONLY THAT DONE

NOW HERBERT SAID I WITH REFERENCE TO GAINING SOME KNOWLEDGE OF
HIS HISTORY THERE IS BUT ONE WAY THAT I KNOW OF I MUST ASK HIM POINT
BLANK

YES ASK HIM SAID HERBERT WHEN WE SIT AT BREAKFAST IN THE
MORNING FOR HE HAD SAID ON TAKING LEAVE OF HERBERT THAT HE WOULD
COME TO BREAKFAST WITH US

WITH THIS PROJECT FORMED WE WENT TO BED I HAD THE WILDEST DREAMS
CONCERNING HIM AND WOKE UNREFRESHED I WOKE TOO TO RECOVER THE FEAR
WHICH I HAD LOST IN THE NIGHT OF HIS BEING FOUND OUT AS A RETURNED
TRANSPORT WAKING I NEVER LOST THAT FEAR

HE CAME ROUND AT THE APPOINTED TIME TOOK OUT HIS JACKKNIFE AND SAT
DOWN TO HIS MEAL HE WAS FULL OF PLANS FOR HIS GENTLEMANS COMING OUT
STRONG AND LIKE A GENTLEMAN AND URGED ME TO BEGIN SPEEDILY UPON THE
POCKETBOOK WHICH HE HAD LEFT IN MY POSSESSION HE CONSIDERED THE
CHAMBERS AND HIS OWN LODGING AS TEMPORARY RESIDENCES AND ADVISED ME TO
LOOK OUT AT ONCE FOR A FASHIONABLE CRIB NEAR HYDE PARK IN WHICH HE
COULD HAVE A SHAKEDOWN WHEN HE HAD MADE AN END OF HIS BREAKFAST
AND WAS WIPING HIS KNIFE ON HIS LEG I SAID TO HIM WITHOUT A WORD OF
PREFACE

AFTER YOU WERE GONE LAST NIGHT I TOLD MY FRIEND OF THE STRUGGLE THAT
THE SOLDIERS FOUND YOU ENGAGED IN ON THE MARSHES WHEN WE CAME UP YOU
REMEMBER

REMEMBER SAID HE I THINK SO

WE WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MANAND ABOUT YOU IT IS STRANGE
TO KNOW NO MORE ABOUT EITHER AND PARTICULARLY YOU THAN I WAS ABLE TO
TELL LAST NIGHT IS NOT THIS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANOTHER FOR OUR KNOWING
MORE

WELL HE SAID AFTER CONSIDERATION YOURE ON YOUR OATH YOU KNOW
PIPS COMRADE

ASSUREDLY REPLIED HERBERT

AS TO ANYTHING I SAY YOU KNOW HE INSISTED THE OATH APPLIES TO
ALL

I UNDERSTAND IT TO DO SO

AND LOOKEE HERE WOTEVER I DONE IS WORKED OUT AND PAID FOR HE
INSISTED AGAIN

SO BE IT

HE TOOK OUT HIS BLACK PIPE AND WAS GOING TO FILL IT WITH NEGROHEAD
WHEN LOOKING AT THE TANGLE OF TOBACCO IN HIS HAND HE SEEMED TO THINK
IT MIGHT PERPLEX THE THREAD OF HIS NARRATIVE HE PUT IT BACK AGAIN
STUCK HIS PIPE IN A BUTTONHOLE OF HIS COAT SPREAD A HAND ON EACH
KNEE AND AFTER TURNING AN ANGRY EYE ON THE FIRE FOR A FEW SILENT
MOMENTS LOOKED ROUND AT US AND SAID WHAT FOLLOWS

HED GOT LEARNING AND HE OVERMATCHED ME FIVE HUNDRED TIMES TOLD AND NO
MERCY MY MISSIS AS I HAD THE HARD TIME WISTOP THOUGH I AINT
BROUGHT HER IN

HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN A CONFUSED WAY AS IF HE HAD LOST HIS PLACE IN
THE BOOK OF HIS REMEMBRANCE AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE FIRE AND
SPREAD HIS HANDS BROADER ON HIS KNEES AND LIFTED THEM OFF AND PUT THEM
ON AGAIN

THERE AINT NO NEED TO GO INTO IT HE SAID LOOKING ROUND ONCE MORE

COMMITTED FOR FELONYON A CHARGE OF PUTTING STOLEN NOTES IN
CIRCULATIONAND THERE WAS OTHER CHARGES BEHIND COMPEYSON SAYS TO ME
SEPARATE DEFENCES NO COMMUNICATION AND THAT WAS ALL AND I WAS SO
MISERABLE POOR THAT I SOLD ALL THE CLOTHES I HAD EXCEPT WHAT HUNG ON
MY BACK AFORE I COULD GET JAGGERS

WHEN WE WAS PUT IN THE DOCK I NOTICED FIRST OF ALL WHAT A GENTLEMAN
COMPEYSON LOOKED WI HIS CURLY HAIR AND HIS BLACK CLOTHES AND HIS
WHITE POCKETHANDKERCHER AND WHAT A COMMON SORT OF A WRETCH I LOOKED
WHEN THE PROSECUTION OPENED AND THE EVIDENCE WAS PUT SHORT AFOREHAND
I NOTICED HOW HEAVY IT ALL BORE ON ME AND HOW LIGHT ON HIM WHEN THE
EVIDENCE WAS GIV IN THE BOX I NOTICED HOW IT WAS ALWAYS ME THAT HAD
COME FORARD AND COULD BE SWORE TO HOW IT WAS ALWAYS ME THAT THE
MONEY HAD BEEN PAID TO HOW IT WAS ALWAYS ME THAT HAD SEEMED TO WORK
THE THING AND GET THE PROFIT BUT WHEN THE DEFENCE COME ON THEN I SEE

HIS DISADVANTAGE AND WARNT IT ME AS HAD BEEN TRIED AFORE AND AS HAD
BEEN KNOWD UP HILL AND DOWN DALE IN BRIDEWELLS AND LOCKUPS AND WHEN

HIS FACE DROPPING EVERY NOW AND THEN INTO HIS WHITE
POCKETHANDKERCHERAH AND WI VERSES IN HIS SPEECH TOOAND WARNT
IT ME AS COULD ONLY SAY GENTLEMEN THIS MAN AT MY SIDE IS A MOST
PRECIOUS RASCAL AND WHEN THE VERDICT COME WARNT IT COMPEYSON AS WAS
RECOMMENDED TO MERCY ON ACCOUNT OF GOOD CHARACTER AND BAD COMPANY AND
GIVING UP ALL THE INFORMATION HE COULD AGEN ME AND WARNT IT ME AS GOT
NEVER A WORD BUT GUILTY AND WHEN I SAYS TO COMPEYSON ONCE OUT OF
THIS COURT ILL SMASH THAT FACE OF YOURN AINT IT COMPEYSON AS PRAYS
THE JUDGE TO BE PROTECTED AND GETS TWO TURNKEYS STOOD BETWIXT US AND
WHEN WERE SENTENCED AINT IT HIM AS GETS SEVEN YEAR AND ME FOURTEEN
AND AINT IT HIM AS THE JUDGE IS SORRY FOR BECAUSE HE MIGHT A DONE SO
WELL AND AINT IT ME AS THE JUDGE PERCEIVES TO BE A OLD OFFENDER OF
WIOLENT PASSION LIKELY TO COME TO WORSE

HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF INTO A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT BUT HE CHECKED
IT TOOK TWO OR THREE SHORT BREATHS SWALLOWED AS OFTEN AND STRETCHING
OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS ME SAID IN A REASSURING MANNER I AINT AGOING
TO BE LOW DEAR BOY

HE HAD SO HEATED HIMSELF THAT HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED
HIS FACE AND HEAD AND NECK AND HANDS BEFORE HE COULD GO ON

ILLUSTRATION

I HAD SAID TO COMPEYSON THAT ID SMASH THAT FACE OF HIS AND I SWORE
LORD SMASH MINE TO DO IT WE WAS IN THE SAME PRISONSHIP BUT I
COULDNT GET AT HIM FOR LONG THOUGH I TRIED AT LAST I COME BEHIND HIM
AND HIT HIM ON THE CHEEK TO TURN HIM ROUND AND GET A SMASHING ONE AT
HIM WHEN I WAS SEEN AND SEIZED THE BLACKHOLE OF THAT SHIP WARNT A
STRONG ONE TO A JUDGE OF BLACKHOLES THAT COULD SWIM AND DIVE I
ESCAPED TO THE SHORE AND I WAS A HIDING AMONG THE GRAVES THERE
ENVYING THEM AS WAS IN EM AND ALL OVER WHEN I FIRST SEE MY BOY

HE REGARDED ME WITH A LOOK OF AFFECTION THAT MADE HIM ALMOST ABHORRENT
TO ME AGAIN THOUGH I HAD FELT GREAT PITY FOR HIM

BY MY BOY I WAS GIV TO UNDERSTAND AS COMPEYSON WAS OUT ON THEM
MARSHES TOO UPON MY SOUL I HALF BELIEVE HE ESCAPED IN HIS TERROR TO
GET QUIT OF ME NOT KNOWING IT WAS ME AS HAD GOT ASHORE I HUNTED HIM
DOWN I SMASHED HIS FACE AND NOW SAYS I AS THE WORST THING I CAN
DO CARING NOTHING FOR MYSELF ILL DRAG YOU BACK AND ID HAVE SWUM
OFF TOWING HIM BY THE HAIR IF IT HAD COME TO THAT AND ID A GOT HIM
ABOARD WITHOUT THE SOLDIERS

OF COURSE HED MUCH THE BEST OF IT TO THE LASTHIS CHARACTER WAS SO
GOOD HE HAD ESCAPED WHEN HE WAS MADE HALF WILD BY ME AND MY MURDEROUS
INTENTIONS AND HIS PUNISHMENT WAS LIGHT I WAS PUT IN IRONS BROUGHT
TO TRIAL AGAIN AND SENT FOR LIFE I DIDNT STOP FOR LIFE DEAR BOY AND
PIPS COMRADE BEING HERE

HE WIPED HIMSELF AGAIN AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE AND THEN SLOWLY TOOK HIS
TANGLE OF TOBACCO FROM HIS POCKET AND PLUCKED HIS PIPE FROM HIS
BUTTONHOLE AND SLOWLY FILLED IT AND BEGAN TO SMOKE

IS HE DEAD I ASKED AFTER A SILENCE

IS WHO DEAD DEAR BOY

COMPEYSON

HE HOPES I AM IF HES ALIVE YOU MAY BE SURE WITH A FIERCE LOOK
I NEVER HEERD NO MORE OF HIM

HERBERT HAD BEEN WRITING WITH HIS PENCIL IN THE COVER OF A BOOK HE
SOFTLY PUSHED THE BOOK OVER TO ME AS PROVIS STOOD SMOKING WITH HIS
EYES ON THE FIRE AND I READ IN IT

YOUNG HAVISHAMS NAME WAS ARTHUR COMPEYSON IS THE MAN WHO PROFESSED
TO BE MISS HAVISHAMS LOVER

I SHUT THE BOOK AND NODDED SLIGHTLY TO HERBERT AND PUT THE BOOK BY
BUT WE NEITHER OF US SAID ANYTHING AND BOTH LOOKED AT PROVIS AS HE
STOOD SMOKING BY THE FIRE




CHAPTER XLIII


WHY SHOULD I PAUSE TO ASK HOW MUCH OF MY SHRINKING FROM PROVIS MIGHT BE
TRACED TO ESTELLA WHY SHOULD I LOITER ON MY ROAD TO COMPARE THE STATE
OF MIND IN WHICH I HAD TRIED TO RID MYSELF OF THE STAIN OF THE PRISON
BEFORE MEETING HER AT THE COACHOFFICE WITH THE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH
I NOW REFLECTED ON THE ABYSS BETWEEN ESTELLA IN HER PRIDE AND BEAUTY
AND THE RETURNED TRANSPORT WHOM I HARBOURED THE ROAD WOULD BE NONE THE
SMOOTHER FOR IT THE END WOULD BE NONE THE BETTER FOR IT HE WOULD NOT
BE HELPED NOR I EXTENUATED

A NEW FEAR HAD BEEN ENGENDERED IN MY MIND BY HIS NARRATIVE OR RATHER
HIS NARRATIVE HAD GIVEN FORM AND PURPOSE TO THE FEAR THAT WAS ALREADY
THERE IF COMPEYSON WERE ALIVE AND SHOULD DISCOVER HIS RETURN I COULD
HARDLY DOUBT THE CONSEQUENCE THAT COMPEYSON STOOD IN MORTAL FEAR OF
HIM NEITHER OF THE TWO COULD KNOW MUCH BETTER THAN I AND THAT ANY
SUCH MAN AS THAT MAN HAD BEEN DESCRIBED TO BE WOULD HESITATE TO RELEASE
HIMSELF FOR GOOD FROM A DREADED ENEMY BY THE SAFE MEANS OF BECOMING AN
INFORMER WAS SCARCELY TO BE IMAGINED

NEVER HAD I BREATHED AND NEVER WOULD I BREATHEOR SO I RESOLVEDA WORD
OF ESTELLA TO PROVIS BUT I SAID TO HERBERT THAT BEFORE I COULD GO
ABROAD I MUST SEE BOTH ESTELLA AND MISS HAVISHAM THIS WAS WHEN WE
WERE LEFT ALONE ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY WHEN PROVIS TOLD US HIS STORY
I RESOLVED TO GO OUT TO RICHMOND NEXT DAY AND I WENT

ON MY PRESENTING MYSELF AT MRS BRANDLEYS ESTELLAS MAID WAS CALLED
TO TELL THAT ESTELLA HAD GONE INTO THE COUNTRY WHERE TO SATIS HOUSE
AS USUAL NOT AS USUAL I SAID FOR SHE HAD NEVER YET GONE THERE
WITHOUT ME WHEN WAS SHE COMING BACK THERE WAS AN AIR OF RESERVATION
IN THE ANSWER WHICH INCREASED MY PERPLEXITY AND THE ANSWER WAS THAT
HER MAID BELIEVED SHE WAS ONLY COMING BACK AT ALL FOR A LITTLE WHILE I
COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THIS EXCEPT THAT IT WAS MEANT THAT I SHOULD MAKE
NOTHING OF IT AND I WENT HOME AGAIN IN COMPLETE DISCOMFITURE

ANOTHER NIGHT CONSULTATION WITH HERBERT AFTER PROVIS WAS GONE HOME I
ALWAYS TOOK HIM HOME AND ALWAYS LOOKED WELL ABOUT ME LED US TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT GOING ABROAD UNTIL I CAME
BACK FROM MISS HAVISHAMS IN THE MEAN TIME HERBERT AND I WERE TO
CONSIDER SEPARATELY WHAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO SAY WHETHER WE SHOULD
DEVISE ANY PRETENCE OF BEING AFRAID THAT HE WAS UNDER SUSPICIOUS
OBSERVATION OR WHETHER I WHO HAD NEVER YET BEEN ABROAD SHOULD
PROPOSE AN EXPEDITION WE BOTH KNEW THAT I HAD BUT TO PROPOSE ANYTHING
AND HE WOULD CONSENT WE AGREED THAT HIS REMAINING MANY DAYS IN HIS
PRESENT HAZARD WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF

NEXT DAY I HAD THE MEANNESS TO FEIGN THAT I WAS UNDER A BINDING PROMISE
TO GO DOWN TO JOE BUT I WAS CAPABLE OF ALMOST ANY MEANNESS TOWARDS JOE
OR HIS NAME PROVIS WAS TO BE STRICTLY CAREFUL WHILE I WAS GONE AND
HERBERT WAS TO TAKE THE CHARGE OF HIM THAT I HAD TAKEN I WAS TO BE
ABSENT ONLY ONE NIGHT AND ON MY RETURN THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS
IMPATIENCE FOR MY STARTING AS A GENTLEMAN ON A GREATER SCALE WAS TO BE
BEGUN IT OCCURRED TO ME THEN AND AS I AFTERWARDS FOUND TO HERBERT
ALSO THAT HE MIGHT BE BEST GOT AWAY ACROSS THE WATER ON THAT
PRETENCEAS TO MAKE PURCHASES OR THE LIKE

HAVING THUS CLEARED THE WAY FOR MY EXPEDITION TO MISS HAVISHAMS I SET
OFF BY THE EARLY MORNING COACH BEFORE IT WAS YET LIGHT AND WAS OUT ON
THE OPEN COUNTRY ROAD WHEN THE DAY CAME CREEPING ON HALTING AND
WHIMPERING AND SHIVERING AND WRAPPED IN PATCHES OF CLOUD AND RAGS OF
MIST LIKE A BEGGAR WHEN WE DROVE UP TO THE BLUE BOAR AFTER A DRIZZLY
RIDE WHOM SHOULD I SEE COME OUT UNDER THE GATEWAY TOOTHPICK IN HAND
TO LOOK AT THE COACH BUT BENTLEY DRUMMLE

AS HE PRETENDED NOT TO SEE ME I PRETENDED NOT TO SEE HIM IT WAS A
VERY LAME PRETENCE ON BOTH SIDES THE LAMER BECAUSE WE BOTH WENT INTO
THE COFFEEROOM WHERE HE HAD JUST FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST AND WHERE I
ORDERED MINE IT WAS POISONOUS TO ME TO SEE HIM IN THE TOWN FOR I VERY
WELL KNEW WHY HE HAD COME THERE

PRETENDING TO READ A SMEARY NEWSPAPER LONG OUT OF DATE WHICH HAD
NOTHING HALF SO LEGIBLE IN ITS LOCAL NEWS AS THE FOREIGN MATTER OF
COFFEE PICKLES FISH SAUCES GRAVY MELTED BUTTER AND WINE WITH WHICH
IT WAS SPRINKLED ALL OVER AS IF IT HAD TAKEN THE MEASLES IN A HIGHLY
IRREGULAR FORM I SAT AT MY TABLE WHILE HE STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE BY
DEGREES IT BECAME AN ENORMOUS INJURY TO ME THAT HE STOOD BEFORE THE
FIRE AND I GOT UP DETERMINED TO HAVE MY SHARE OF IT I HAD TO PUT MY
HAND BEHIND HIS LEGS FOR THE POKER WHEN I WENT UP TO THE FIREPLACE TO
STIR THE FIRE BUT STILL PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW HIM

IS THIS A CUT SAID MR DRUMMLE

OH SAID I POKER IN HAND ITS YOU IS IT HOW DO YOU DO I WAS
WONDERING WHO IT WAS WHO KEPT THE FIRE OFF

WITH THAT I POKED TREMENDOUSLY AND HAVING DONE SO PLANTED MYSELF
SIDE BY SIDE WITH MR DRUMMLE MY SHOULDERS SQUARED AND MY BACK TO THE
FIRE

YOU HAVE JUST COME DOWN SAID MR DRUMMLE EDGING ME A LITTLE AWAY
WITH HIS SHOULDER

YES SAID I EDGING HIM A LITTLE AWAY WITH MY SHOULDER

BEASTLY PLACE SAID DRUMMLE YOUR PART OF THE COUNTRY I THINK

YES I ASSENTED I AM TOLD ITS VERY LIKE YOUR SHROPSHIRE

NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE IT SAID DRUMMLE

HERE MR DRUMMLE LOOKED AT HIS BOOTS AND I LOOKED AT MINE AND THEN MR
DRUMMLE LOOKED AT MY BOOTS AND I LOOKED AT HIS

HAVE YOU BEEN HERE LONG I ASKED DETERMINED NOT TO YIELD AN INCH OF
THE FIRE

LONG ENOUGH TO BE TIRED OF IT RETURNED DRUMMLE PRETENDING TO YAWN
BUT EQUALLY DETERMINED

DO YOU STAY HERE LONG

CANT SAY ANSWERED MR DRUMMLE DO YOU

CANT SAY SAID I

I FELT HERE THROUGH A TINGLING IN MY BLOOD THAT IF MR DRUMMLES
SHOULDER HAD CLAIMED ANOTHER HAIRS BREADTH OF ROOM I SHOULD HAVE
JERKED HIM INTO THE WINDOW EQUALLY THAT IF MY OWN SHOULDER HAD URGED
A SIMILAR CLAIM MR DRUMMLE WOULD HAVE JERKED ME INTO THE NEAREST BOX
HE WHISTLED A LITTLE SO DID I

LARGE TRACT OF MARSHES ABOUT HERE I BELIEVE SAID DRUMMLE

YES WHAT OF THAT SAID I

MR DRUMMLE LOOKED AT ME AND THEN AT MY BOOTS AND THEN SAID OH
AND LAUGHED

ARE YOU AMUSED MR DRUMMLE

NO SAID HE NOT PARTICULARLY I AM GOING OUT FOR A RIDE IN THE
SADDLE I MEAN TO EXPLORE THOSE MARSHES FOR AMUSEMENT OUTOFTHEWAY
VILLAGES THERE THEY TELL ME CURIOUS LITTLE PUBLICHOUSESAND
SMITHIESAND THAT WAITER

YES SIR

IS THAT HORSE OF MINE READY

BROUGHT ROUND TO THE DOOR SIR

I SAY LOOK HERE YOU SIR THE LADY WONT RIDE TODAY THE WEATHER
WONT DO

VERY GOOD SIR

AND I DONT DINE BECAUSE IM GOING TO DINE AT THE LADYS

VERY GOOD SIR

THEN DRUMMLE GLANCED AT ME WITH AN INSOLENT TRIUMPH ON HIS
GREATJOWLED FACE THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART DULL AS HE WAS AND SO
EXASPERATED ME THAT I FELT INCLINED TO TAKE HIM IN MY ARMS AS THE
ROBBER IN THE STORYBOOK IS SAID TO HAVE TAKEN THE OLD LADY AND SEAT
HIM ON THE FIRE

ONE THING WAS MANIFEST TO BOTH OF US AND THAT WAS THAT UNTIL RELIEF
CAME NEITHER OF US COULD RELINQUISH THE FIRE THERE WE STOOD WELL
SQUARED UP BEFORE IT SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AND FOOT TO FOOT WITH OUR
HANDS BEHIND US NOT BUDGING AN INCH THE HORSE WAS VISIBLE OUTSIDE IN
THE DRIZZLE AT THE DOOR MY BREAKFAST WAS PUT ON THE TABLE DRUMMLES
WAS CLEARED AWAY THE WAITER INVITED ME TO BEGIN I NODDED WE BOTH
STOOD OUR GROUND

HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE GROVE SINCE SAID DRUMMLE

NO SAID I I HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THE FINCHES THE LAST TIME I WAS
THERE

WAS THAT WHEN WE HAD A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

YES I REPLIED VERY SHORTLY

COME COME THEY LET YOU OFF EASILY ENOUGH SNEERED DRUMMLE YOU
SHOULDNT HAVE LOST YOUR TEMPER

MR DRUMMLE SAID I YOU ARE NOT COMPETENT TO GIVE ADVICE ON THAT
SUBJECT WHEN I LOSE MY TEMPER NOT THAT I ADMIT HAVING DONE SO ON THAT
OCCASION I DONT THROW GLASSES

I DO SAID DRUMMLE

AFTER GLANCING AT HIM ONCE OR TWICE IN AN INCREASED STATE OF
SMOULDERING FEROCITY I SAID

MR DRUMMLE I DID NOT SEEK THIS CONVERSATION AND I DONT THINK IT AN
AGREEABLE ONE

I AM SURE ITS NOT SAID HE SUPERCILIOUSLY OVER HIS SHOULDER I
DONT THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT

AND THEREFORE I WENT ON WITH YOUR LEAVE I WILL SUGGEST THAT WE
HOLD NO KIND OF COMMUNICATION IN FUTURE

QUITE MY OPINION SAID DRUMMLE AND WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUGGESTED
MYSELF OR DONEMORE LIKELYWITHOUT SUGGESTING BUT DONT LOSE YOUR
TEMPER HAVENT YOU LOST ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT

WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR

WAITER SAID DRUMMLE BY WAY OF ANSWERING ME

THE WAITER REAPPEARED

LOOK HERE YOU SIR YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT THE YOUNG LADY DONT
RIDE TODAY AND THAT I DINE AT THE YOUNG LADYS

QUITE SO SIR

WHEN THE WAITER HAD FELT MY FASTCOOLING TEAPOT WITH THE PALM OF HIS
HAND AND HAD LOOKED IMPLORINGLY AT ME AND HAD GONE OUT DRUMMLE
CAREFUL NOT TO MOVE THE SHOULDER NEXT ME TOOK A CIGAR FROM HIS POCKET
AND BIT THE END OFF BUT SHOWED NO SIGN OF STIRRING CHOKING AND
BOILING AS I WAS I FELT THAT WE COULD NOT GO A WORD FURTHER WITHOUT
INTRODUCING ESTELLAS NAME WHICH I COULD NOT ENDURE TO HEAR HIM UTTER
AND THEREFORE I LOOKED STONILY AT THE OPPOSITE WALL AS IF THERE WERE
NO ONE PRESENT AND FORCED MYSELF TO SILENCE HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE
REMAINED IN THIS RIDICULOUS POSITION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY BUT FOR
THE INCURSION OF THREE THRIVING FARMERSLAID ON BY THE WAITER I
THINKWHO CAME INTO THE COFFEEROOM UNBUTTONING THEIR GREATCOATS AND
RUBBING THEIR HANDS AND BEFORE WHOM AS THEY CHARGED AT THE FIRE WE
WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE WAY

I SAW HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW SEIZING HIS HORSES MANE AND MOUNTING IN
HIS BLUNDERING BRUTAL MANNER AND SIDLING AND BACKING AWAY I THOUGHT
HE WAS GONE WHEN HE CAME BACK CALLING FOR A LIGHT FOR THE CIGAR IN
HIS MOUTH WHICH HE HAD FORGOTTEN A MAN IN A DUSTCOLOURED DRESS
APPEARED WITH WHAT WAS WANTEDI COULD NOT HAVE SAID FROM WHERE
WHETHER FROM THE INN YARD OR THE STREET OR WHERE NOTAND AS DRUMMLE
LEANED DOWN FROM THE SADDLE AND LIGHTED HIS CIGAR AND LAUGHED WITH A
JERK OF HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE COFFEEROOM WINDOWS THE SLOUCHING
SHOULDERS AND RAGGED HAIR OF THIS MAN WHOSE BACK WAS TOWARDS ME
REMINDED ME OF ORLICK

TOO HEAVILY OUT OF SORTS TO CARE MUCH AT THE TIME WHETHER IT WERE HE OR
NO OR AFTER ALL TO TOUCH THE BREAKFAST I WASHED THE WEATHER AND THE
JOURNEY FROM MY FACE AND HANDS AND WENT OUT TO THE MEMORABLE OLD HOUSE
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR ME NEVER TO HAVE
ENTERED NEVER TO HAVE SEEN




CHAPTER XLIV


IN THE ROOM WHERE THE DRESSINGTABLE STOOD AND WHERE THE WAXCANDLES
BURNT ON THE WALL I FOUND MISS HAVISHAM AND ESTELLA MISS HAVISHAM
SEATED ON A SETTEE NEAR THE FIRE AND ESTELLA ON A CUSHION AT HER FEET
ESTELLA WAS KNITTING AND MISS HAVISHAM WAS LOOKING ON THEY BOTH
RAISED THEIR EYES AS I WENT IN AND BOTH SAW AN ALTERATION IN ME I
DERIVED THAT FROM THE LOOK THEY INTERCHANGED

AND WHAT WIND SAID MISS HAVISHAM BLOWS YOU HERE PIP

THOUGH SHE LOOKED STEADILY AT ME I SAW THAT SHE WAS RATHER CONFUSED
ESTELLA PAUSING A MOMENT IN HER KNITTING WITH HER EYES UPON ME AND
THEN GOING ON I FANCIED THAT I READ IN THE ACTION OF HER FINGERS AS
PLAINLY AS IF SHE HAD TOLD ME IN THE DUMB ALPHABET THAT SHE PERCEIVED
I HAD DISCOVERED MY REAL BENEFACTOR

MISS HAVISHAM SAID I I WENT TO RICHMOND YESTERDAY TO SPEAK TO
ESTELLA AND FINDING THAT SOME WIND HAD BLOWN HER HERE I FOLLOWED

MISS HAVISHAM MOTIONING TO ME FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME TO SIT DOWN
I TOOK THE CHAIR BY THE DRESSINGTABLE WHICH I HAD OFTEN SEEN HER
OCCUPY WITH ALL THAT RUIN AT MY FEET AND ABOUT ME IT SEEMED A NATURAL
PLACE FOR ME THAT DAY

WHAT I HAD TO SAY TO ESTELLA MISS HAVISHAM I WILL SAY BEFORE YOU
PRESENTLYIN A FEW MOMENTS IT WILL NOT SURPRISE YOU IT WILL NOT
DISPLEASE YOU I AM AS UNHAPPY AS YOU CAN EVER HAVE MEANT ME TO BE

MISS HAVISHAM CONTINUED TO LOOK STEADILY AT ME I COULD SEE IN THE
ACTION OF ESTELLAS FINGERS AS THEY WORKED THAT SHE ATTENDED TO WHAT I
SAID BUT SHE DID NOT LOOK UP

I HAVE FOUND OUT WHO MY PATRON IS IT IS NOT A FORTUNATE DISCOVERY
AND IS NOT LIKELY EVER TO ENRICH ME IN REPUTATION STATION FORTUNE
ANYTHING THERE ARE REASONS WHY I MUST SAY NO MORE OF THAT IT IS NOT
MY SECRET BUT ANOTHERS

AS I WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE LOOKING AT ESTELLA AND CONSIDERING HOW TO
GO ON MISS HAVISHAM REPEATED IT IS NOT YOUR SECRET BUT ANOTHERS
WELL

WHEN YOU FIRST CAUSED ME TO BE BROUGHT HERE MISS HAVISHAM WHEN I
BELONGED TO THE VILLAGE OVER YONDER THAT I WISH I HAD NEVER LEFT I
SUPPOSE I DID REALLY COME HERE AS ANY OTHER CHANCE BOY MIGHT HAVE
COMEAS A KIND OF SERVANT TO GRATIFY A WANT OR A WHIM AND TO BE PAID
FOR IT

AY PIP REPLIED MISS HAVISHAM STEADILY NODDING HER HEAD YOU DID

AND THAT MR JAGGERS

MR JAGGERS SAID MISS HAVISHAM TAKING ME UP IN A FIRM TONE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND KNEW NOTHING OF IT HIS BEING MY LAWYER AND
HIS BEING THE LAWYER OF YOUR PATRON IS A COINCIDENCE HE HOLDS THE SAME
RELATION TOWARDS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND IT MIGHT EASILY ARISE BE THAT
AS IT MAY IT DID ARISE AND WAS NOT BROUGHT ABOUT BY ANY ONE

ANY ONE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IN HER HAGGARD FACE THAT THERE WAS NO
SUPPRESSION OR EVASION SO FAR

BUT WHEN I FELL INTO THE MISTAKE I HAVE SO LONG REMAINED IN AT LEAST
YOU LED ME ON SAID I

YES SHE RETURNED AGAIN NODDING STEADILY I LET YOU GO ON

WAS THAT KIND

WHO AM I CRIED MISS HAVISHAM STRIKING HER STICK UPON THE FLOOR AND
FLASHING INTO WRATH SO SUDDENLY THAT ESTELLA GLANCED UP AT HER IN
SURPRISEWHO AM I FOR GODS SAKE THAT I SHOULD BE KIND

IT WAS A WEAK COMPLAINT TO HAVE MADE AND I HAD NOT MEANT TO MAKE IT I
TOLD HER SO AS SHE SAT BROODING AFTER THIS OUTBURST

WELL WELL WELL SHE SAID WHAT ELSE

I WAS LIBERALLY PAID FOR MY OLD ATTENDANCE HERE I SAID TO SOOTHE
HER IN BEING APPRENTICED AND I HAVE ASKED THESE QUESTIONS ONLY FOR
MY OWN INFORMATION WHAT FOLLOWS HAS ANOTHER AND I HOPE MORE
DISINTERESTED PURPOSE IN HUMOURING MY MISTAKE MISS HAVISHAM YOU
PUNISHEDPRACTISED ONPERHAPS YOU WILL SUPPLY WHATEVER TERM EXPRESSES
YOUR INTENTION WITHOUT OFFENCEYOUR SELFSEEKING RELATIONS

I DID WHY THEY WOULD HAVE IT SO SO WOULD YOU WHAT HAS BEEN MY
HISTORY THAT I SHOULD BE AT THE PAINS OF ENTREATING EITHER THEM OR YOU
NOT TO HAVE IT SO YOU MADE YOUR OWN SNARES I NEVER MADE THEM

WAITING UNTIL SHE WAS QUIET AGAINFOR THIS TOO FLASHED OUT OF HER IN
A WILD AND SUDDEN WAYI WENT ON

I HAVE BEEN THROWN AMONG ONE FAMILY OF YOUR RELATIONS MISS HAVISHAM
AND HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY AMONG THEM SINCE I WENT TO LONDON I KNOW THEM
TO HAVE BEEN AS HONESTLY UNDER MY DELUSION AS I MYSELF AND I SHOULD BE
FALSE AND BASE IF I DID NOT TELL YOU WHETHER IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO YOU
OR NO AND WHETHER YOU ARE INCLINED TO GIVE CREDENCE TO IT OR NO THAT
YOU DEEPLY WRONG BOTH MR MATTHEW POCKET AND HIS SON HERBERT IF YOU
SUPPOSE THEM TO BE OTHERWISE THAN GENEROUS UPRIGHT OPEN AND
INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING DESIGNING OR MEAN

THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS SAID MISS HAVISHAM

THEY MADE THEMSELVES MY FRIENDS SAID I WHEN THEY SUPPOSED ME TO
HAVE SUPERSEDED THEM AND WHEN SARAH POCKET MISS GEORGIANA AND
MISTRESS CAMILLA WERE NOT MY FRIENDS I THINK

THIS CONTRASTING OF THEM WITH THE REST SEEMED I WAS GLAD TO SEE TO DO
THEM GOOD WITH HER SHE LOOKED AT ME KEENLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND
THEN SAID QUIETLY

WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THEM

ONLY SAID I THAT YOU WOULD NOT CONFOUND THEM WITH THE OTHERS THEY
MAY BE OF THE SAME BLOOD BUT BELIEVE ME THEY ARE NOT OF THE SAME
NATURE

STILL LOOKING AT ME KEENLY MISS HAVISHAM REPEATED

WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THEM

I AM NOT SO CUNNING YOU SEE I SAID IN ANSWER CONSCIOUS THAT I
REDDENED A LITTLE AS THAT I COULD HIDE FROM YOU EVEN IF I DESIRED
THAT I DO WANT SOMETHING MISS HAVISHAM IF YOU WOULD SPARE THE MONEY
TO DO MY FRIEND HERBERT A LASTING SERVICE IN LIFE BUT WHICH FROM THE
NATURE OF THE CASE MUST BE DONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE I COULD SHOW YOU
HOW

WHY MUST IT BE DONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE SHE ASKED SETTLING HER
HANDS UPON HER STICK THAT SHE MIGHT REGARD ME THE MORE ATTENTIVELY

BECAUSE SAID I I BEGAN THE SERVICE MYSELF MORE THAN TWO YEARS
AGO WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND I DONT WANT TO BE BETRAYED WHY I FAIL
IN MY ABILITY TO FINISH IT I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT IS A PART OF THE
SECRET WHICH IS ANOTHER PERSONS AND NOT MINE

SHE GRADUALLY WITHDREW HER EYES FROM ME AND TURNED THEM ON THE FIRE
AFTER WATCHING IT FOR WHAT APPEARED IN THE SILENCE AND BY THE LIGHT OF
THE SLOWLY WASTING CANDLES TO BE A LONG TIME SHE WAS ROUSED BY THE
COLLAPSE OF SOME OF THE RED COALS AND LOOKED TOWARDS ME AGAINAT
FIRST VACANTLYTHEN WITH A GRADUALLY CONCENTRATING ATTENTION ALL
THIS TIME ESTELLA KNITTED ON WHEN MISS HAVISHAM HAD FIXED HER
ATTENTION ON ME SHE SAID SPEAKING AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO LAPSE IN
OUR DIALOGUE

WHAT ELSE

ESTELLA SAID I TURNING TO HER NOW AND TRYING TO COMMAND MY
TREMBLING VOICE YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE LOVED YOU
LONG AND DEARLY

SHE RAISED HER EYES TO MY FACE ON BEING THUS ADDRESSED AND HER
FINGERS PLIED THEIR WORK AND SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH AN UNMOVED
COUNTENANCE I SAW THAT MISS HAVISHAM GLANCED FROM ME TO HER AND FROM
HER TO ME

I SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS SOONER BUT FOR MY LONG MISTAKE IT INDUCED ME
TO HOPE THAT MISS HAVISHAM MEANT US FOR ONE ANOTHER WHILE I THOUGHT
YOU COULD NOT HELP YOURSELF AS IT WERE I REFRAINED FROM SAYING IT
BUT I MUST SAY IT NOW

PRESERVING HER UNMOVED COUNTENANCE AND WITH HER FINGERS STILL GOING
ESTELLA SHOOK HER HEAD

I KNOW SAID I IN ANSWER TO THAT ACTIONI KNOW I HAVE NO HOPE
THAT I SHALL EVER CALL YOU MINE ESTELLA I AM IGNORANT WHAT MAY BECOME
OF ME VERY SOON HOW POOR I MAY BE OR WHERE I MAY GO STILL I LOVE
YOU I HAVE LOVED YOU EVER SINCE I FIRST SAW YOU IN THIS HOUSE

LOOKING AT ME PERFECTLY UNMOVED AND WITH HER FINGERS BUSY SHE SHOOK
HER HEAD AGAIN

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUEL IN MISS HAVISHAM HORRIBLY CRUEL TO PRACTISE
ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF A POOR BOY AND TO TORTURE ME THROUGH ALL
THESE YEARS WITH A VAIN HOPE AND AN IDLE PURSUIT IF SHE HAD REFLECTED
ON THE GRAVITY OF WHAT SHE DID BUT I THINK SHE DID NOT I THINK THAT
IN THE ENDURANCE OF HER OWN TRIAL SHE FORGOT MINE ESTELLA

I SAW MISS HAVISHAM PUT HER HAND TO HER HEART AND HOLD IT THERE AS SHE
SAT LOOKING BY TURNS AT ESTELLA AND AT ME

IT SEEMS SAID ESTELLA VERY CALMLY THAT THERE ARE SENTIMENTS
FANCIESI DONT KNOW HOW TO CALL THEMWHICH I AM NOT ABLE TO
COMPREHEND WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN AS A FORM
OF WORDS BUT NOTHING MORE YOU ADDRESS NOTHING IN MY BREAST YOU TOUCH
NOTHING THERE I DONT CARE FOR WHAT YOU SAY AT ALL I HAVE TRIED TO
WARN YOU OF THIS NOW HAVE I NOT

I SAID IN A MISERABLE MANNER YES

YES BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE WARNED FOR YOU THOUGHT I DID NOT MEAN IT
NOW DID YOU NOT THINK SO

I THOUGHT AND HOPED YOU COULD NOT MEAN IT YOU SO YOUNG UNTRIED AND
BEAUTIFUL ESTELLA SURELY IT IS NOT IN NATURE

IT IS IN MY NATURE SHE RETURNED AND THEN SHE ADDED WITH A STRESS
UPON THE WORDS IT IS IN THE NATURE FORMED WITHIN ME I MAKE A GREAT
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND ALL OTHER PEOPLE WHEN I SAY SO MUCH I CAN
DO NO MORE

IS IT NOT TRUE SAID I THAT BENTLEY DRUMMLE IS IN TOWN HERE AND
PURSUING YOU

IT IS QUITE TRUE SHE REPLIED REFERRING TO HIM WITH THE INDIFFERENCE
OF UTTER CONTEMPT

THAT YOU ENCOURAGE HIM AND RIDE OUT WITH HIM AND THAT HE DINES WITH
YOU THIS VERY DAY

SHE SEEMED A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT I SHOULD KNOW IT BUT AGAIN REPLIED
QUITE TRUE

YOU CANNOT LOVE HIM ESTELLA

HER FINGERS STOPPED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS SHE RETORTED RATHER ANGRILY
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU DO YOU STILL THINK IN SPITE OF IT THAT I DO
NOT MEAN WHAT I SAY

YOU WOULD NEVER MARRY HIM ESTELLA

SHE LOOKED TOWARDS MISS HAVISHAM AND CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT WITH HER
WORK IN HER HANDS THEN SHE SAID WHY NOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH I AM
GOING TO BE MARRIED TO HIM

I DROPPED MY FACE INTO MY HANDS BUT WAS ABLE TO CONTROL MYSELF BETTER
THAN I COULD HAVE EXPECTED CONSIDERING WHAT AGONY IT GAVE ME TO HEAR
HER SAY THOSE WORDS WHEN I RAISED MY FACE AGAIN THERE WAS SUCH A
GHASTLY LOOK UPON MISS HAVISHAMS THAT IT IMPRESSED ME EVEN IN MY
PASSIONATE HURRY AND GRIEF

ESTELLA DEAREST ESTELLA DO NOT LET MISS HAVISHAM LEAD YOU INTO THIS
FATAL STEP PUT ME ASIDE FOR EVERYOU HAVE DONE SO I WELL KNOWBUT
BESTOW YOURSELF ON SOME WORTHIER PERSON THAN DRUMMLE MISS HAVISHAM
GIVES YOU TO HIM AS THE GREATEST SLIGHT AND INJURY THAT COULD BE DONE
TO THE MANY FAR BETTER MEN WHO ADMIRE YOU AND TO THE FEW WHO TRULY
LOVE YOU AMONG THOSE FEW THERE MAY BE ONE WHO LOVES YOU EVEN AS
DEARLY THOUGH HE HAS NOT LOVED YOU AS LONG AS I TAKE HIM AND I CAN
BEAR IT BETTER FOR YOUR SAKE

MY EARNESTNESS AWOKE A WONDER IN HER THAT SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOUCHED WITH COMPASSION IF SHE COULD HAVE RENDERED ME AT ALL
INTELLIGIBLE TO HER OWN MIND

I AM GOING SHE SAID AGAIN IN A GENTLER VOICE TO BE MARRIED TO
HIM THE PREPARATIONS FOR MY MARRIAGE ARE MAKING AND I SHALL BE
MARRIED SOON WHY DO YOU INJURIOUSLY INTRODUCE THE NAME OF MY MOTHER BY
ADOPTION IT IS MY OWN ACT

YOUR OWN ACT ESTELLA TO FLING YOURSELF AWAY UPON A BRUTE

ON WHOM SHOULD I FLING MYSELF AWAY SHE RETORTED WITH A SMILE
SHOULD I FLING MYSELF AWAY UPON THE MAN WHO WOULD THE SOONEST FEEL IF
PEOPLE DO FEEL SUCH THINGS THAT I TOOK NOTHING TO HIM THERE IT IS
DONE I SHALL DO WELL ENOUGH AND SO WILL MY HUSBAND AS TO LEADING ME
INTO WHAT YOU CALL THIS FATAL STEP MISS HAVISHAM WOULD HAVE HAD ME
WAIT AND NOT MARRY YET BUT I AM TIRED OF THE LIFE I HAVE LED WHICH
HAS VERY FEW CHARMS FOR ME AND I AM WILLING ENOUGH TO CHANGE IT SAY
NO MORE WE SHALL NEVER UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER

SUCH A MEAN BRUTE SUCH A STUPID BRUTE I URGED IN DESPAIR

DONT BE AFRAID OF MY BEING A BLESSING TO HIM SAID ESTELLA I SHALL
NOT BE THAT COME HERE IS MY HAND DO WE PART ON THIS YOU VISIONARY
BOYOR MAN

O ESTELLA I ANSWERED AS MY BITTER TEARS FELL FAST ON HER HAND DO

HOLD MY HEAD UP WITH THE REST HOW COULD I SEE YOU DRUMMLES WIFE

ROUGH COMMON BOY WHOSE POOR HEART YOU WOUNDED EVEN THEN YOU HAVE BEEN
IN EVERY PROSPECT I HAVE EVER SEEN SINCEON THE RIVER ON THE SAILS OF
THE SHIPS ON THE MARSHES IN THE CLOUDS IN THE LIGHT IN THE
DARKNESS IN THE WIND IN THE WOODS IN THE SEA IN THE STREETS YOU

BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE STONES OF WHICH THE STRONGEST LONDON
BUILDINGS ARE MADE ARE NOT MORE REAL OR MORE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE
DISPLACED BY YOUR HANDS THAN YOUR PRESENCE AND INFLUENCE HAVE BEEN TO
ME THERE AND EVERYWHERE AND WILL BE ESTELLA TO THE LAST HOUR OF MY
LIFE YOU CANNOT CHOOSE BUT REMAIN PART OF MY CHARACTER PART OF THE
LITTLE GOOD IN ME PART OF THE EVIL BUT IN THIS SEPARATION I
ASSOCIATE YOU ONLY WITH THE GOOD AND I WILL FAITHFULLY HOLD YOU TO
THAT ALWAYS FOR YOU MUST HAVE DONE ME FAR MORE GOOD THAN HARM LET ME
FEEL NOW WHAT SHARP DISTRESS I MAY O GOD BLESS YOU GOD FORGIVE YOU

IN WHAT ECSTASY OF UNHAPPINESS I GOT THESE BROKEN WORDS OUT OF MYSELF
I DONT KNOW THE RHAPSODY WELLED UP WITHIN ME LIKE BLOOD FROM AN
INWARD WOUND AND GUSHED OUT I HELD HER HAND TO MY LIPS SOME LINGERING
MOMENTS AND SO I LEFT HER BUT EVER AFTERWARDS I REMEMBEREDAND SOON
AFTERWARDS WITH STRONGER REASONTHAT WHILE ESTELLA LOOKED AT ME MERELY
WITH INCREDULOUS WONDER THE SPECTRAL FIGURE OF MISS HAVISHAM HER HAND
STILL COVERING HER HEART SEEMED ALL RESOLVED INTO A GHASTLY STARE OF
PITY AND REMORSE

ALL DONE ALL GONE SO MUCH WAS DONE AND GONE THAT WHEN I WENT OUT AT
THE GATE THE LIGHT OF THE DAY SEEMED OF A DARKER COLOUR THAN WHEN I
WENT IN FOR A WHILE I HID MYSELF AMONG SOME LANES AND BYPATHS AND
THEN STRUCK OFF TO WALK ALL THE WAY TO LONDON FOR I HAD BY THAT TIME
COME TO MYSELF SO FAR AS TO CONSIDER THAT I COULD NOT GO BACK TO THE
INN AND SEE DRUMMLE THERE THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO SIT UPON THE COACH
AND BE SPOKEN TO THAT I COULD DO NOTHING HALF SO GOOD FOR MYSELF AS
TIRE MYSELF OUT

IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT WHEN I CROSSED LONDON BRIDGE PURSUING THE NARROW
INTRICACIES OF THE STREETS WHICH AT THAT TIME TENDED WESTWARD NEAR THE
MIDDLESEX SHORE OF THE RIVER MY READIEST ACCESS TO THE TEMPLE WAS
CLOSE BY THE RIVERSIDE THROUGH WHITEFRIARS I WAS NOT EXPECTED TILL
TOMORROW BUT I HAD MY KEYS AND IF HERBERT WERE GONE TO BED COULD
GET TO BED MYSELF WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM

AS IT SELDOM HAPPENED THAT I CAME IN AT THAT WHITEFRIARS GATE AFTER THE
TEMPLE WAS CLOSED AND AS I WAS VERY MUDDY AND WEARY I DID NOT TAKE IT
ILL THAT THE NIGHTPORTER EXAMINED ME WITH MUCH ATTENTION AS HE HELD
THE GATE A LITTLE WAY OPEN FOR ME TO PASS IN TO HELP HIS MEMORY I
MENTIONED MY NAME

I WAS NOT QUITE SURE SIR BUT I THOUGHT SO HERES A NOTE SIR THE
MESSENGER THAT BROUGHT IT SAID WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS READ IT BY MY
LANTERN

ILLUSTRATION

MUCH SURPRISED BY THE REQUEST I TOOK THE NOTE IT WAS DIRECTED TO
PHILIP PIP ESQUIRE AND ON THE TOP OF THE SUPERSCRIPTION WERE THE
WORDS PLEASE READ THIS HERE I OPENED IT THE WATCHMAN HOLDING UP
HIS LIGHT AND READ INSIDE IN WEMMICKS WRITING

DONT GO HOME




CHAPTER XLV


TURNING FROM THE TEMPLE GATE AS SOON AS I HAD READ THE WARNING I MADE
THE BEST OF MY WAY TO FLEET STREET AND THERE GOT A LATE HACKNEY
CHARIOT AND DROVE TO THE HUMMUMS IN COVENT GARDEN IN THOSE TIMES A BED
WAS ALWAYS TO BE GOT THERE AT ANY HOUR OF THE NIGHT AND THE
CHAMBERLAIN LETTING ME IN AT HIS READY WICKET LIGHTED THE CANDLE NEXT
IN ORDER ON HIS SHELF AND SHOWED ME STRAIGHT INTO THE BEDROOM NEXT IN
ORDER ON HIS LIST IT WAS A SORT OF VAULT ON THE GROUND FLOOR AT THE
BACK WITH A DESPOTIC MONSTER OF A FOURPOST BEDSTEAD IN IT STRADDLING
OVER THE WHOLE PLACE PUTTING ONE OF HIS ARBITRARY LEGS INTO THE
FIREPLACE AND ANOTHER INTO THE DOORWAY AND SQUEEZING THE WRETCHED
LITTLE WASHINGSTAND IN QUITE A DIVINELY RIGHTEOUS MANNER

AS I HAD ASKED FOR A NIGHTLIGHT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD BROUGHT ME IN
BEFORE HE LEFT ME THE GOOD OLD CONSTITUTIONAL RUSHLIGHT OF THOSE
VIRTUOUS DAYSAN OBJECT LIKE THE GHOST OF A WALKINGCANE WHICH
INSTANTLY BROKE ITS BACK IF IT WERE TOUCHED WHICH NOTHING COULD EVER
BE LIGHTED AT AND WHICH WAS PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AT THE
BOTTOM OF A HIGH TIN TOWER PERFORATED WITH ROUND HOLES THAT MADE A
STARINGLY WIDEAWAKE PATTERN ON THE WALLS WHEN I HAD GOT INTO BED AND
LAY THERE FOOTSORE WEARY AND WRETCHED I FOUND THAT I COULD NO MORE
CLOSE MY OWN EYES THAN I COULD CLOSE THE EYES OF THIS FOOLISH ARGUS
AND THUS IN THE GLOOM AND DEATH OF THE NIGHT WE STARED AT ONE
ANOTHER

WHAT A DOLEFUL NIGHT HOW ANXIOUS HOW DISMAL HOW LONG THERE WAS AN
INHOSPITABLE SMELL IN THE ROOM OF COLD SOOT AND HOT DUST AND AS I
LOOKED UP INTO THE CORNERS OF THE TESTER OVER MY HEAD I THOUGHT WHAT A
NUMBER OF BLUEBOTTLE FLIES FROM THE BUTCHERS AND EARWIGS FROM THE
MARKET AND GRUBS FROM THE COUNTRY MUST BE HOLDING ON UP THERE LYING
BY FOR NEXT SUMMER THIS LED ME TO SPECULATE WHETHER ANY OF THEM EVER
TUMBLED DOWN AND THEN I FANCIED THAT I FELT LIGHT FALLS ON MY FACEA
DISAGREEABLE TURN OF THOUGHT SUGGESTING OTHER AND MORE OBJECTIONABLE
APPROACHES UP MY BACK WHEN I HAD LAIN AWAKE A LITTLE WHILE THOSE
EXTRAORDINARY VOICES WITH WHICH SILENCE TEEMS BEGAN TO MAKE THEMSELVES
AUDIBLE THE CLOSET WHISPERED THE FIREPLACE SIGHED THE LITTLE
WASHINGSTAND TICKED AND ONE GUITARSTRING PLAYED OCCASIONALLY IN THE
CHEST OF DRAWERS AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE EYES ON THE WALL ACQUIRED
A NEW EXPRESSION AND IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE STARING ROUNDS I SAW
WRITTEN DONT GO HOME

WHATEVER NIGHTFANCIES AND NIGHTNOISES CROWDED ON ME THEY NEVER
WARDED OFF THIS DONT GO HOME IT PLAITED ITSELF INTO WHATEVER I
THOUGHT OF AS A BODILY PAIN WOULD HAVE DONE NOT LONG BEFORE I HAD
READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS HOW A GENTLEMAN UNKNOWN HAD COME TO THE HUMMUMS
IN THE NIGHT AND HAD GONE TO BED AND HAD DESTROYED HIMSELF AND HAD
BEEN FOUND IN THE MORNING WELTERING IN BLOOD IT CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT
HE MUST HAVE OCCUPIED THIS VERY VAULT OF MINE AND I GOT OUT OF BED TO
ASSURE MYSELF THAT THERE WERE NO RED MARKS ABOUT THEN OPENED THE DOOR
TO LOOK OUT INTO THE PASSAGES AND CHEER MYSELF WITH THE COMPANIONSHIP
OF A DISTANT LIGHT NEAR WHICH I KNEW THE CHAMBERLAIN TO BE DOZING BUT
ALL THIS TIME WHY I WAS NOT TO GO HOME AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT HOME
AND WHEN I SHOULD GO HOME AND WHETHER PROVIS WAS SAFE AT HOME WERE
QUESTIONS OCCUPYING MY MIND SO BUSILY THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED
THERE COULD BE NO MORE ROOM IN IT FOR ANY OTHER THEME EVEN WHEN I
THOUGHT OF ESTELLA AND HOW WE HAD PARTED THAT DAY FOREVER AND WHEN I
RECALLED ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR PARTING AND ALL HER LOOKS AND
TONES AND THE ACTION OF HER FINGERS WHILE SHE KNITTEDEVEN THEN I WAS
PURSUING HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE THE CAUTION DONT GO HOME
WHEN AT LAST I DOZED IN SHEER EXHAUSTION OF MIND AND BODY IT BECAME A
VAST SHADOWY VERB WHICH I HAD TO CONJUGATE IMPERATIVE MOOD PRESENT
TENSE DO NOT THOU GO HOME LET HIM NOT GO HOME LET US NOT GO HOME DO
NOT YE OR YOU GO HOME LET NOT THEM GO HOME THEN POTENTIALLY I MAY
NOT AND I CANNOT GO HOME AND I MIGHT NOT COULD NOT WOULD NOT AND
SHOULD NOT GO HOME UNTIL I FELT THAT I WAS GOING DISTRACTED AND
ROLLED OVER ON THE PILLOW AND LOOKED AT THE STARING ROUNDS UPON THE
WALL AGAIN

I HAD LEFT DIRECTIONS THAT I WAS TO BE CALLED AT SEVEN FOR IT WAS
PLAIN THAT I MUST SEE WEMMICK BEFORE SEEING ANY ONE ELSE AND EQUALLY
PLAIN THAT THIS WAS A CASE IN WHICH HIS WALWORTH SENTIMENTS ONLY COULD
BE TAKEN IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM WHERE THE NIGHT HAD
BEEN SO MISERABLE AND I NEEDED NO SECOND KNOCKING AT THE DOOR TO
STARTLE ME FROM MY UNEASY BED

THE CASTLE BATTLEMENTS AROSE UPON MY VIEW AT EIGHT OCLOCK THE LITTLE
SERVANT HAPPENING TO BE ENTERING THE FORTRESS WITH TWO HOT ROLLS I
PASSED THROUGH THE POSTERN AND CROSSED THE DRAWBRIDGE IN HER COMPANY
AND SO CAME WITHOUT ANNOUNCEMENT INTO THE PRESENCE OF WEMMICK AS HE WAS
MAKING TEA FOR HIMSELF AND THE AGED AN OPEN DOOR AFFORDED A
PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF THE AGED IN BED

HALLOA MR PIP SAID WEMMICK YOU DID COME HOME THEN

YES I RETURNED BUT I DIDNT GO HOME

THATS ALL RIGHT SAID HE RUBBING HIS HANDS I LEFT A NOTE FOR YOU
AT EACH OF THE TEMPLE GATES ON THE CHANCE WHICH GATE DID YOU COME
TO

I TOLD HIM

ILL GO ROUND TO THE OTHERS IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND DESTROY THE
NOTES SAID WEMMICK ITS A GOOD RULE NEVER TO LEAVE DOCUMENTARY
EVIDENCE IF YOU CAN HELP IT BECAUSE YOU DONT KNOW WHEN IT MAY BE PUT
IN IM GOING TO TAKE A LIBERTY WITH YOU WOULD YOU MIND TOASTING
THIS SAUSAGE FOR THE AGED P

I SAID I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DO IT

THEN YOU CAN GO ABOUT YOUR WORK MARY ANNE SAID WEMMICK TO THE
LITTLE SERVANT WHICH LEAVES US TO OURSELVES DONT YOU SEE MR PIP
HE ADDED WINKING AS SHE DISAPPEARED

I THANKED HIM FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP AND CAUTION AND OUR DISCOURSE
PROCEEDED IN A LOW TONE WHILE I TOASTED THE AGEDS SAUSAGE AND HE
BUTTERED THE CRUMB OF THE AGEDS ROLL

NOW MR PIP YOU KNOW SAID WEMMICK YOU AND I UNDERSTAND ONE
ANOTHER WE ARE IN OUR PRIVATE AND PERSONAL CAPACITIES AND WE HAVE
BEEN ENGAGED IN A CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION BEFORE TODAY OFFICIAL
SENTIMENTS ARE ONE THING WE ARE EXTRA OFFICIAL

I CORDIALLY ASSENTED I WAS SO VERY NERVOUS THAT I HAD ALREADY LIGHTED
THE AGEDS SAUSAGE LIKE A TORCH AND BEEN OBLIGED TO BLOW IT OUT

I ACCIDENTALLY HEARD YESTERDAY MORNING SAID WEMMICK BEING IN A
CERTAIN PLACE WHERE I ONCE TOOK YOUEVEN BETWEEN YOU AND ME ITS AS
WELL NOT TO MENTION NAMES WHEN AVOIDABLE

MUCH BETTER NOT SAID I I UNDERSTAND YOU

I HEARD THERE BY CHANCE YESTERDAY MORNING SAID WEMMICK THAT A
CERTAIN PERSON NOT ALTOGETHER OF UNCOLONIAL PURSUITS AND NOT
UNPOSSESSED OF PORTABLE PROPERTYI DONT KNOW WHO IT MAY REALLY BEWE
WONT NAME THIS PERSON

NOT NECESSARY SAID I

HAD MADE SOME LITTLE STIR IN A CERTAIN PART OF THE WORLD WHERE A GOOD
MANY PEOPLE GO NOT ALWAYS IN GRATIFICATION OF THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS
AND NOT QUITE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT EXPENSE

IN WATCHING HIS FACE I MADE QUITE A FIREWORK OF THE AGEDS SAUSAGE
AND GREATLY DISCOMPOSED BOTH MY OWN ATTENTION AND WEMMICKS FOR WHICH
I APOLOGISED

BY DISAPPEARING FROM SUCH PLACE AND BEING NO MORE HEARD OF
THEREABOUTS FROM WHICH SAID WEMMICK CONJECTURES HAD BEEN RAISED
AND THEORIES FORMED I ALSO HEARD THAT YOU AT YOUR CHAMBERS IN GARDEN
COURT TEMPLE HAD BEEN WATCHED AND MIGHT BE WATCHED AGAIN

BY WHOM SAID I

I WOULDNT GO INTO THAT SAID WEMMICK EVASIVELY IT MIGHT CLASH
WITH OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITIES I HEARD IT AS I HAVE IN MY TIME HEARD
OTHER CURIOUS THINGS IN THE SAME PLACE I DONT TELL IT YOU ON
INFORMATION RECEIVED I HEARD IT

HE TOOK THE TOASTINGFORK AND SAUSAGE FROM ME AS HE SPOKE AND SET
FORTH THE AGEDS BREAKFAST NEATLY ON A LITTLE TRAY PREVIOUS TO PLACING
IT BEFORE HIM HE WENT INTO THE AGEDS ROOM WITH A CLEAN WHITE CLOTH
AND TIED THE SAME UNDER THE OLD GENTLEMANS CHIN AND PROPPED HIM UP
AND PUT HIS NIGHTCAP ON ONE SIDE AND GAVE HIM QUITE A RAKISH AIR THEN
HE PLACED HIS BREAKFAST BEFORE HIM WITH GREAT CARE AND SAID ALL
RIGHT AINT YOU AGED P TO WHICH THE CHEERFUL AGED REPLIED ALL
RIGHT JOHN MY BOY ALL RIGHT AS THERE SEEMED TO BE A TACIT
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AGED WAS NOT IN A PRESENTABLE STATE AND WAS
THEREFORE TO BE CONSIDERED INVISIBLE I MADE A PRETENCE OF BEING IN
COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS

THIS WATCHING OF ME AT MY CHAMBERS WHICH I HAVE ONCE HAD REASON TO
SUSPECT I SAID TO WEMMICK WHEN HE CAME BACK IS INSEPARABLE FROM
THE PERSON TO WHOM YOU HAVE ADVERTED IS IT

WEMMICK LOOKED VERY SERIOUS I COULDNT UNDERTAKE TO SAY THAT OF MY
OWN KNOWLEDGE I MEAN I COULDNT UNDERTAKE TO SAY IT WAS AT FIRST BUT
IT EITHER IS OR IT WILL BE OR ITS IN GREAT DANGER OF BEING

AS I SAW THAT HE WAS RESTRAINED BY FEALTY TO LITTLE BRITAIN FROM SAYING
AS MUCH AS HE COULD AND AS I KNEW WITH THANKFULNESS TO HIM HOW FAR OUT
OF HIS WAY HE WENT TO SAY WHAT HE DID I COULD NOT PRESS HIM BUT I
TOLD HIM AFTER A LITTLE MEDITATION OVER THE FIRE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO
ASK HIM A QUESTION SUBJECT TO HIS ANSWERING OR NOT ANSWERING AS HE
DEEMED RIGHT AND SURE THAT HIS COURSE WOULD BE RIGHT HE PAUSED IN HIS
BREAKFAST AND CROSSING HIS ARMS AND PINCHING HIS SHIRTSLEEVES HIS
NOTION OF INDOOR COMFORT WAS TO SIT WITHOUT ANY COAT HE NODDED TO ME
ONCE TO PUT MY QUESTION

YOU HAVE HEARD OF A MAN OF BAD CHARACTER WHOSE TRUE NAME IS
COMPEYSON

HE ANSWERED WITH ONE OTHER NOD

IS HE LIVING

ONE OTHER NOD

IS HE IN LONDON

HE GAVE ME ONE OTHER NOD COMPRESSED THE POSTOFFICE EXCEEDINGLY GAVE
ME ONE LAST NOD AND WENT ON WITH HIS BREAKFAST

NOW SAID WEMMICK QUESTIONING BEING OVER WHICH HE EMPHASISED AND
REPEATED FOR MY GUIDANCE I COME TO WHAT I DID AFTER HEARING WHAT I
HEARD I WENT TO GARDEN COURT TO FIND YOU NOT FINDING YOU I WENT TO
CLARRIKERS TO FIND MR HERBERT

AND HIM YOU FOUND SAID I WITH GREAT ANXIETY

AND HIM I FOUND WITHOUT MENTIONING ANY NAMES OR GOING INTO ANY
DETAILS I GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF HE WAS AWARE OF ANYBODYTOM
JACK OR RICHARDBEING ABOUT THE CHAMBERS OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE
NEIGHBOURHOOD HE HAD BETTER GET TOM JACK OR RICHARD OUT OF THE WAY
WHILE YOU WERE OUT OF THE WAY

HE WOULD BE GREATLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO

HE WAS PUZZLED WHAT TO DO NOT THE LESS BECAUSE I GAVE HIM MY
OPINION THAT IT WAS NOT SAFE TO TRY TO GET TOM JACK OR RICHARD TOO
FAR OUT OF THE WAY AT PRESENT MR PIP ILL TELL YOU SOMETHING UNDER
EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE A GREAT CITY WHEN YOU
ARE ONCE IN IT DONT BREAK COVER TOO SOON LIE CLOSE WAIT TILL THINGS
SLACKEN BEFORE YOU TRY THE OPEN EVEN FOR FOREIGN AIR

I THANKED HIM FOR HIS VALUABLE ADVICE AND ASKED HIM WHAT HERBERT HAD
DONE

MR HERBERT SAID WEMMICK AFTER BEING ALL OF A HEAP FOR HALF AN
HOUR STRUCK OUT A PLAN HE MENTIONED TO ME AS A SECRET THAT HE IS
COURTING A YOUNG LADY WHO HAS AS NO DOUBT YOU ARE AWARE A BEDRIDDEN
PA WHICH PA HAVING BEEN IN THE PURSER LINE OF LIFE LIES ABED IN A
BOWWINDOW WHERE HE CAN SEE THE SHIPS SAIL UP AND DOWN THE RIVER YOU
ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE YOUNG LADY MOST PROBABLY

NOT PERSONALLY SAID I

THE TRUTH WAS THAT SHE HAD OBJECTED TO ME AS AN EXPENSIVE COMPANION
WHO DID HERBERT NO GOOD AND THAT WHEN HERBERT HAD FIRST PROPOSED TO
PRESENT ME TO HER SHE HAD RECEIVED THE PROPOSAL WITH SUCH VERY
MODERATE WARMTH THAT HERBERT HAD FELT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO CONFIDE THE
STATE OF THE CASE TO ME WITH A VIEW TO THE LAPSE OF A LITTLE TIME
BEFORE I MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE WHEN I HAD BEGUN TO ADVANCE HERBERTS
PROSPECTS BY STEALTH I HAD BEEN ABLE TO BEAR THIS WITH CHEERFUL
PHILOSOPHY HE AND HIS AFFIANCED FOR THEIR PART HAD NATURALLY NOT
BEEN VERY ANXIOUS TO INTRODUCE A THIRD PERSON INTO THEIR INTERVIEWS
AND THUS ALTHOUGH I WAS ASSURED THAT I HAD RISEN IN CLARAS ESTEEM
AND ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG LADY AND I HAD LONG REGULARLY INTERCHANGED
MESSAGES AND REMEMBRANCES BY HERBERT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER HOWEVER I
DID NOT TROUBLE WEMMICK WITH THESE PARTICULARS

THE HOUSE WITH THE BOWWINDOW SAID WEMMICK BEING BY THE
RIVERSIDE DOWN THE POOL THERE BETWEEN LIMEHOUSE AND GREENWICH AND
BEING KEPT IT SEEMS BY A VERY RESPECTABLE WIDOW WHO HAS A FURNISHED
UPPER FLOOR TO LET MR HERBERT PUT IT TO ME WHAT DID I THINK OF THAT
AS A TEMPORARY TENEMENT FOR TOM JACK OR RICHARD NOW I THOUGHT VERY
WELL OF IT FOR THREE REASONS ILL GIVE YOU THAT IS TO SAY FIRSTLY
ITS ALTOGETHER OUT OF ALL YOUR BEATS AND IS WELL AWAY FROM THE USUAL
HEAP OF STREETS GREAT AND SMALL SECONDLY WITHOUT GOING NEAR IT
YOURSELF YOU COULD ALWAYS HEAR OF THE SAFETY OF TOM JACK OR RICHARD
THROUGH MR HERBERT THIRDLY AFTER A WHILE AND WHEN IT MIGHT BE
PRUDENT IF YOU SHOULD WANT TO SLIP TOM JACK OR RICHARD ON BOARD A
FOREIGN PACKETBOAT THERE HE ISREADY

MUCH COMFORTED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I THANKED WEMMICK AGAIN AND
AGAIN AND BEGGED HIM TO PROCEED

WELL SIR MR HERBERT THREW HIMSELF INTO THE BUSINESS WITH A WILL
AND BY NINE OCLOCK LAST NIGHT HE HOUSED TOM JACK OR
RICHARDWHICHEVER IT MAY BEYOU AND I DONT WANT TO KNOWQUITE
SUCCESSFULLY AT THE OLD LODGINGS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS
SUMMONED TO DOVER AND IN FACT HE WAS TAKEN DOWN THE DOVER ROAD AND
CORNERED OUT OF IT NOW ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE OF ALL THIS IS THAT
IT WAS DONE WITHOUT YOU AND WHEN IF ANY ONE WAS CONCERNING HIMSELF
ABOUT YOUR MOVEMENTS YOU MUST BE KNOWN TO BE EVER SO MANY MILES OFF
AND QUITE OTHERWISE ENGAGED THIS DIVERTS SUSPICION AND CONFUSES IT
AND FOR THE SAME REASON I RECOMMENDED THAT EVEN IF YOU CAME BACK LAST
NIGHT YOU SHOULD NOT GO HOME IT BRINGS IN MORE CONFUSION AND YOU
WANT CONFUSION

WEMMICK HAVING FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST HERE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND
BEGAN TO GET HIS COAT ON

AND NOW MR PIP SAID HE WITH HIS HANDS STILL IN THE SLEEVES I
HAVE PROBABLY DONE THE MOST I CAN DO BUT IF I CAN EVER DO MOREFROM A
WALWORTH POINT OF VIEW AND IN A STRICTLY PRIVATE AND PERSONAL
CAPACITYI SHALL BE GLAD TO DO IT HERES THE ADDRESS THERE CAN BE NO
HARM IN YOUR GOING HERE TONIGHT AND SEEING FOR YOURSELF THAT ALL IS
WELL WITH TOM JACK OR RICHARD BEFORE YOU GO HOMEWHICH IS ANOTHER
REASON FOR YOUR NOT GOING HOME LAST NIGHT BUT AFTER YOU HAVE GONE
HOME DONT GO BACK HERE YOU ARE VERY WELCOME I AM SURE MR PIP
HIS HANDS WERE NOW OUT OF HIS SLEEVES AND I WAS SHAKING THEM AND LET
ME FINALLY IMPRESS ONE IMPORTANT POINT UPON YOU HE LAID HIS HANDS
UPON MY SHOULDERS AND ADDED IN A SOLEMN WHISPER AVAIL YOURSELF OF
THIS EVENING TO LAY HOLD OF HIS PORTABLE PROPERTY YOU DONT KNOW WHAT
MAY HAPPEN TO HIM DONT LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THE PORTABLE PROPERTY

QUITE DESPAIRING OF MAKING MY MIND CLEAR TO WEMMICK ON THIS POINT I
FORBORE TO TRY

TIMES UP SAID WEMMICK AND I MUST BE OFF IF YOU HAD NOTHING MORE
PRESSING TO DO THAN TO KEEP HERE TILL DARK THATS WHAT I SHOULD
ADVISE YOU LOOK VERY MUCH WORRIED AND IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD TO HAVE A
PERFECTLY QUIET DAY WITH THE AGEDHELL BE UP PRESENTLYAND A LITTLE
BIT OFYOU REMEMBER THE PIG

OF COURSE SAID I

WELL AND A LITTLE BIT OF HIM THAT SAUSAGE YOU TOASTED WAS HIS AND
HE WAS IN ALL RESPECTS A FIRSTRATER DO TRY HIM IF IT IS ONLY FOR OLD
ACQUAINTANCE SAKE GOODBYE AGED PARENT IN A CHEERY SHOUT

ALL RIGHT JOHN ALL RIGHT MY BOY PIPED THE OLD MAN FROM WITHIN

I SOON FELL ASLEEP BEFORE WEMMICKS FIRE AND THE AGED AND I ENJOYED
ONE ANOTHERS SOCIETY BY FALLING ASLEEP BEFORE IT MORE OR LESS ALL DAY
WE HAD LOIN OF PORK FOR DINNER AND GREENS GROWN ON THE ESTATE AND I
NODDED AT THE AGED WITH A GOOD INTENTION WHENEVER I FAILED TO DO IT
DROWSILY WHEN IT WAS QUITE DARK I LEFT THE AGED PREPARING THE FIRE
FOR TOAST AND I INFERRED FROM THE NUMBER OF TEACUPS AS WELL AS FROM
HIS GLANCES AT THE TWO LITTLE DOORS IN THE WALL THAT MISS SKIFFINS WAS
EXPECTED




CHAPTER XLVI


EIGHT OCLOCK HAD STRUCK BEFORE I GOT INTO THE AIR THAT WAS SCENTED
NOT DISAGREEABLY BY THE CHIPS AND SHAVINGS OF THE LONGSHORE
BOATBUILDERS AND MAST OAR AND BLOCK MAKERS ALL THAT WATERSIDE
REGION OF THE UPPER AND LOWER POOL BELOW BRIDGE WAS UNKNOWN GROUND TO
ME AND WHEN I STRUCK DOWN BY THE RIVER I FOUND THAT THE SPOT I WANTED
WAS NOT WHERE I HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AND WAS ANYTHING BUT EASY TO
FIND IT WAS CALLED MILL POND BANK CHINKSS BASIN AND I HAD NO OTHER
GUIDE TO CHINKSS BASIN THAN THE OLD GREEN COPPER ROPEWALK

IT MATTERS NOT WHAT STRANDED SHIPS REPAIRING IN DRY DOCKS I LOST MYSELF
AMONG WHAT OLD HULLS OF SHIPS IN COURSE OF BEING KNOCKED TO PIECES
WHAT OOZE AND SLIME AND OTHER DREGS OF TIDE WHAT YARDS OF
SHIPBUILDERS AND SHIPBREAKERS WHAT RUSTY ANCHORS BLINDLY BITING INTO
THE GROUND THOUGH FOR YEARS OFF DUTY WHAT MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY OF
ACCUMULATED CASKS AND TIMBER HOW MANY ROPEWALKS THAT WERE NOT THE OLD
GREEN COPPER AFTER SEVERAL TIMES FALLING SHORT OF MY DESTINATION AND
AS OFTEN OVERSHOOTING IT I CAME UNEXPECTEDLY ROUND A CORNER UPON MILL
POND BANK IT WAS A FRESH KIND OF PLACE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED
WHERE THE WIND FROM THE RIVER HAD ROOM TO TURN ITSELF ROUND AND THERE
WERE TWO OR THREE TREES IN IT AND THERE WAS THE STUMP OF A RUINED
WINDMILL AND THERE WAS THE OLD GREEN COPPER ROPEWALKWHOSE LONG AND
NARROW VISTA I COULD TRACE IN THE MOONLIGHT ALONG A SERIES OF WOODEN
FRAMES SET IN THE GROUND THAT LOOKED LIKE SUPERANNUATED
HAYMAKINGRAKES WHICH HAD GROWN OLD AND LOST MOST OF THEIR TEETH

SELECTING FROM THE FEW QUEER HOUSES UPON MILL POND BANK A HOUSE WITH A
WOODEN FRONT AND THREE STORIES OF BOWWINDOW NOT BAYWINDOW WHICH IS
ANOTHER THING I LOOKED AT THE PLATE UPON THE DOOR AND READ THERE
MRS WHIMPLE THAT BEING THE NAME I WANTED I KNOCKED AND AN ELDERLY
WOMAN OF A PLEASANT AND THRIVING APPEARANCE RESPONDED SHE WAS
IMMEDIATELY DEPOSED HOWEVER BY HERBERT WHO SILENTLY LED ME INTO THE
PARLOUR AND SHUT THE DOOR IT WAS AN ODD SENSATION TO SEE HIS VERY
FAMILIAR FACE ESTABLISHED QUITE AT HOME IN THAT VERY UNFAMILIAR ROOM
AND REGION AND I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING AT HIM MUCH AS I LOOKED AT THE
CORNERCUPBOARD WITH THE GLASS AND CHINA THE SHELLS UPON THE
CHIMNEYPIECE AND THE COLOURED ENGRAVINGS ON THE WALL REPRESENTING
THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN COOK A SHIPLAUNCH AND HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE
THE THIRD IN A STATE COACHMANS WIG LEATHERBREECHES AND TOPBOOTS
ON THE TERRACE AT WINDSOR

ALL IS WELL HANDEL SAID HERBERT AND HE IS QUITE SATISFIED THOUGH
EAGER TO SEE YOU MY DEAR GIRL IS WITH HER FATHER AND IF YOULL WAIT
TILL SHE COMES DOWN ILL MAKE YOU KNOWN TO HER AND THEN WELL GO
UPSTAIRS THATS HER FATHER

I HAD BECOME AWARE OF AN ALARMING GROWLING OVERHEAD AND HAD PROBABLY
EXPRESSED THE FACT IN MY COUNTENANCE

I AM AFRAID HE IS A SAD OLD RASCAL SAID HERBERT SMILING BUT I
HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM DONT YOU SMELL RUM HE IS ALWAYS AT IT

AT RUM SAID I

YES RETURNED HERBERT AND YOU MAY SUPPOSE HOW MILD IT MAKES HIS
GOUT HE PERSISTS TOO IN KEEPING ALL THE PROVISIONS UPSTAIRS IN HIS
ROOM AND SERVING THEM OUT HE KEEPS THEM ON SHELVES OVER HIS HEAD AND
WILL WEIGH THEM ALL HIS ROOM MUST BE LIKE A CHANDLERS SHOP

WHILE HE THUS SPOKE THE GROWLING NOISE BECAME A PROLONGED ROAR AND
THEN DIED AWAY

WHAT ELSE CAN BE THE CONSEQUENCE SAID HERBERT IN EXPLANATION IF
HE WILL CUT THE CHEESE A MAN WITH THE GOUT IN HIS RIGHT HANDAND
EVERYWHERE ELSECANT EXPECT TO GET THROUGH A DOUBLE GLOUCESTER WITHOUT
HURTING HIMSELF

HE SEEMED TO HAVE HURT HIMSELF VERY MUCH FOR HE GAVE ANOTHER FURIOUS
ROAR

TO HAVE PROVIS FOR AN UPPER LODGER IS QUITE A GODSEND TO MRS
WHIMPLE SAID HERBERT FOR OF COURSE PEOPLE IN GENERAL WONT STAND
THAT NOISE A CURIOUS PLACE HANDEL ISNT IT

IT WAS A CURIOUS PLACE INDEED BUT REMARKABLY WELL KEPT AND CLEAN

MRS WHIMPLE SAID HERBERT WHEN I TOLD HIM SO IS THE BEST OF
HOUSEWIVES AND I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT MY CLARA WOULD DO WITHOUT HER
MOTHERLY HELP FOR CLARA HAS NO MOTHER OF HER OWN HANDEL AND NO
RELATION IN THE WORLD BUT OLD GRUFFANDGRIM

SURELY THATS NOT HIS NAME HERBERT

NO NO SAID HERBERT THATS MY NAME FOR HIM HIS NAME IS MR
BARLEY BUT WHAT A BLESSING IT IS FOR THE SON OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER
TO LOVE A GIRL WHO HAS NO RELATIONS AND WHO CAN NEVER BOTHER HERSELF
OR ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT HER FAMILY

HERBERT HAD TOLD ME ON FORMER OCCASIONS AND NOW REMINDED ME THAT HE
FIRST KNEW MISS CLARA BARLEY WHEN SHE WAS COMPLETING HER EDUCATION AT
AN ESTABLISHMENT AT HAMMERSMITH AND THAT ON HER BEING RECALLED HOME TO
NURSE HER FATHER HE AND SHE HAD CONFIDED THEIR AFFECTION TO THE
MOTHERLY MRS WHIMPLE BY WHOM IT HAD BEEN FOSTERED AND REGULATED WITH
EQUAL KINDNESS AND DISCRETION EVER SINCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT
NOTHING OF A TENDER NATURE COULD POSSIBLY BE CONFIDED TO OLD BARLEY BY
REASON OF HIS BEING TOTALLY UNEQUAL TO THE CONSIDERATION OF ANY SUBJECT
MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN GOUT RUM AND PURSERS STORES

AS WE WERE THUS CONVERSING IN A LOW TONE WHILE OLD BARLEYS SUSTAINED
GROWL VIBRATED IN THE BEAM THAT CROSSED THE CEILING THE ROOM DOOR
OPENED AND A VERY PRETTY SLIGHT DARKEYED GIRL OF TWENTY OR SO CAME
IN WITH A BASKET IN HER HAND WHOM HERBERT TENDERLY RELIEVED OF THE
BASKET AND PRESENTED BLUSHING AS CLARA SHE REALLY WAS A MOST
CHARMING GIRL AND MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR A CAPTIVE FAIRY WHOM THAT
TRUCULENT OGRE OLD BARLEY HAD PRESSED INTO HIS SERVICE

LOOK HERE SAID HERBERT SHOWING ME THE BASKET WITH A COMPASSIONATE
AND TENDER SMILE AFTER WE HAD TALKED A LITTLE HERES POOR CLARAS
SUPPER SERVED OUT EVERY NIGHT HERES HER ALLOWANCE OF BREAD AND
HERES HER SLICE OF CHEESE AND HERES HER RUMWHICH I DRINK THIS IS
MR BARLEYS BREAKFAST FOR TOMORROW SERVED OUT TO BE COOKED TWO
MUTTONCHOPS THREE POTATOES SOME SPLIT PEAS A LITTLE FLOUR TWO
OUNCES OF BUTTER A PINCH OF SALT AND ALL THIS BLACK PEPPER ITS
STEWED UP TOGETHER AND TAKEN HOT AND ITS A NICE THING FOR THE GOUT
I SHOULD THINK

THERE WAS SOMETHING SO NATURAL AND WINNING IN CLARAS RESIGNED WAY OF
LOOKING AT THESE STORES IN DETAIL AS HERBERT POINTED THEM OUT AND
SOMETHING SO CONFIDING LOVING AND INNOCENT IN HER MODEST MANNER OF
YIELDING HERSELF TO HERBERTS EMBRACING ARM AND SOMETHING SO GENTLE IN
HER SO MUCH NEEDING PROTECTION ON MILL POND BANK BY CHINKSS BASIN
AND THE OLD GREEN COPPER ROPEWALK WITH OLD BARLEY GROWLING IN THE
BEAMTHAT I WOULD NOT HAVE UNDONE THE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN HER AND
HERBERT FOR ALL THE MONEY IN THE POCKETBOOK I HAD NEVER OPENED

I WAS LOOKING AT HER WITH PLEASURE AND ADMIRATION WHEN SUDDENLY THE
GROWL SWELLED INTO A ROAR AGAIN AND A FRIGHTFUL BUMPING NOISE WAS
HEARD ABOVE AS IF A GIANT WITH A WOODEN LEG WERE TRYING TO BORE IT
THROUGH THE CEILING TO COME AT US UPON THIS CLARA SAID TO HERBERT
PAPA WANTS ME DARLING AND RAN AWAY

THERE IS AN UNCONSCIONABLE OLD SHARK FOR YOU SAID HERBERT WHAT DO
YOU SUPPOSE HE WANTS NOW HANDEL

I DONT KNOW SAID I SOMETHING TO DRINK

THATS IT CRIED HERBERT AS IF I HAD MADE A GUESS OF EXTRAORDINARY
MERIT HE KEEPS HIS GROG READY MIXED IN A LITTLE TUB ON THE TABLE
WAIT A MOMENT AND YOULL HEAR CLARA LIFT HIM UP TO TAKE SOME THERE HE
GOES ANOTHER ROAR WITH A PROLONGED SHAKE AT THE END NOW SAID
HERBERT AS IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY SILENCE HES DRINKING NOW SAID
HERBERT AS THE GROWL RESOUNDED IN THE BEAM ONCE MORE HES DOWN AGAIN
ON HIS BACK

CLARA RETURNED SOON AFTERWARDS AND HERBERT ACCOMPANIED ME UPSTAIRS TO
SEE OUR CHARGE AS WE PASSED MR BARLEYS DOOR HE WAS HEARD HOARSELY
MUTTERING WITHIN IN A STRAIN THAT ROSE AND FELL LIKE WIND THE
FOLLOWING REFRAIN IN WHICH I SUBSTITUTE GOOD WISHES FOR SOMETHING
QUITE THE REVERSE

AHOY BLESS YOUR EYES HERES OLD BILL BARLEY HERES OLD BILL BARLEY
BLESS YOUR EYES HERES OLD BILL BARLEY ON THE FLAT OF HIS BACK BY THE
LORD LYING ON THE FLAT OF HIS BACK LIKE A DRIFTING OLD DEAD FLOUNDER
HERES YOUR OLD BILL BARLEY BLESS YOUR EYES AHOY BLESS YOU

IN THIS STRAIN OF CONSOLATION HERBERT INFORMED ME THE INVISIBLE BARLEY
WOULD COMMUNE WITH HIMSELF BY THE DAY AND NIGHT TOGETHER OFTEN WHILE
IT WAS LIGHT HAVING AT THE SAME TIME ONE EYE AT A TELESCOPE WHICH
WAS FITTED ON HIS BED FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF SWEEPING THE RIVER

IN HIS TWO CABIN ROOMS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE WHICH WERE FRESH AND
AIRY AND IN WHICH MR BARLEY WAS LESS AUDIBLE THAN BELOW I FOUND
PROVIS COMFORTABLY SETTLED HE EXPRESSED NO ALARM AND SEEMED TO FEEL
NONE THAT WAS WORTH MENTIONING BUT IT STRUCK ME THAT HE WAS
SOFTENEDINDEFINABLY FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SAID HOW AND COULD NEVER
AFTERWARDS RECALL HOW WHEN I TRIED BUT CERTAINLY

THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE DAYS REST HAD GIVEN ME FOR REFLECTION HAD
RESULTED IN MY FULLY DETERMINING TO SAY NOTHING TO HIM RESPECTING
COMPEYSON FOR ANYTHING I KNEW HIS ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THE MAN MIGHT
OTHERWISE LEAD TO HIS SEEKING HIM OUT AND RUSHING ON HIS OWN
DESTRUCTION THEREFORE WHEN HERBERT AND I SAT DOWN WITH HIM BY HIS
FIRE I ASKED HIM FIRST OF ALL WHETHER HE RELIED ON WEMMICKS JUDGMENT
AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION

AY AY DEAR BOY HE ANSWERED WITH A GRAVE NOD JAGGERS KNOWS

THEN I HAVE TALKED WITH WEMMICK SAID I AND HAVE COME TO TELL YOU
WHAT CAUTION HE GAVE ME AND WHAT ADVICE

THIS I DID ACCURATELY WITH THE RESERVATION JUST MENTIONED AND I TOLD
HIM HOW WEMMICK HAD HEARD IN NEWGATE PRISON WHETHER FROM OFFICERS OR
PRISONERS I COULD NOT SAY THAT HE WAS UNDER SOME SUSPICION AND THAT
MY CHAMBERS HAD BEEN WATCHED HOW WEMMICK HAD RECOMMENDED HIS KEEPING
CLOSE FOR A TIME AND MY KEEPING AWAY FROM HIM AND WHAT WEMMICK HAD
SAID ABOUT GETTING HIM ABROAD I ADDED THAT OF COURSE WHEN THE TIME
CAME I SHOULD GO WITH HIM OR SHOULD FOLLOW CLOSE UPON HIM AS MIGHT
BE SAFEST IN WEMMICKS JUDGMENT WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW THAT I DID NOT
TOUCH UPON NEITHER INDEED WAS I AT ALL CLEAR OR COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT
IN MY OWN MIND NOW THAT I SAW HIM IN THAT SOFTER CONDITION AND IN
DECLARED PERIL FOR MY SAKE AS TO ALTERING MY WAY OF LIVING BY
ENLARGING MY EXPENSES I PUT IT TO HIM WHETHER IN OUR PRESENT UNSETTLED
AND DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD NOT BE SIMPLY RIDICULOUS IF IT
WERE NO WORSE

HE COULD NOT DENY THIS AND INDEED WAS VERY REASONABLE THROUGHOUT HIS
COMING BACK WAS A VENTURE HE SAID AND HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN IT TO BE A
VENTURE HE WOULD DO NOTHING TO MAKE IT A DESPERATE VENTURE AND HE HAD
VERY LITTLE FEAR OF HIS SAFETY WITH SUCH GOOD HELP

HERBERT WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THE FIRE AND PONDERING HERE SAID THAT
SOMETHING HAD COME INTO HIS THOUGHTS ARISING OUT OF WEMMICKS
SUGGESTION WHICH IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO PURSUE WE ARE BOTH GOOD
WATERMEN HANDEL AND COULD TAKE HIM DOWN THE RIVER OURSELVES WHEN THE
RIGHT TIME COMES NO BOAT WOULD THEN BE HIRED FOR THE PURPOSE AND NO
BOATMEN THAT WOULD SAVE AT LEAST A CHANCE OF SUSPICION AND ANY CHANCE
IS WORTH SAVING NEVER MIND THE SEASON DONT YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE A
GOOD THING IF YOU BEGAN AT ONCE TO KEEP A BOAT AT THE TEMPLE STAIRS
AND WERE IN THE HABIT OF ROWING UP AND DOWN THE RIVER YOU FALL INTO
THAT HABIT AND THEN WHO NOTICES OR MINDS DO IT TWENTY OR FIFTY TIMES
AND THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL IN YOUR DOING IT THE TWENTYFIRST OR
FIFTYFIRST

I LIKED THIS SCHEME AND PROVIS WAS QUITE ELATED BY IT WE AGREED THAT
IT SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION AND THAT PROVIS SHOULD NEVER
RECOGNISE US IF WE CAME BELOW BRIDGE AND ROWED PAST MILL POND BANK
BUT WE FURTHER AGREED THAT HE SHOULD PULL DOWN THE BLIND IN THAT PART
OF HIS WINDOW WHICH GAVE UPON THE EAST WHENEVER HE SAW US AND ALL WAS
RIGHT

OUR CONFERENCE BEING NOW ENDED AND EVERYTHING ARRANGED I ROSE TO GO
REMARKING TO HERBERT THAT HE AND I HAD BETTER NOT GO HOME TOGETHER AND
THAT I WOULD TAKE HALF AN HOURS START OF HIM I DONT LIKE TO LEAVE
YOU HERE I SAID TO PROVIS THOUGH I CANNOT DOUBT YOUR BEING SAFER
HERE THAN NEAR ME GOODBYE

DEAR BOY HE ANSWERED CLASPING MY HANDS I DONT KNOW WHEN WE MAY
MEET AGAIN AND I DONT LIKE GOODBYE SAY GOODNIGHT

GOODNIGHT HERBERT WILL GO REGULARLY BETWEEN US AND WHEN THE TIME
COMES YOU MAY BE CERTAIN I SHALL BE READY GOODNIGHT GOODNIGHT

WE THOUGHT IT BEST THAT HE SHOULD STAY IN HIS OWN ROOMS AND WE LEFT
HIM ON THE LANDING OUTSIDE HIS DOOR HOLDING A LIGHT OVER THE
STAIRRAIL TO LIGHT US DOWNSTAIRS LOOKING BACK AT HIM I THOUGHT OF
THE FIRST NIGHT OF HIS RETURN WHEN OUR POSITIONS WERE REVERSED AND
WHEN I LITTLE SUPPOSED MY HEART COULD EVER BE AS HEAVY AND ANXIOUS AT
PARTING FROM HIM AS IT WAS NOW

OLD BARLEY WAS GROWLING AND SWEARING WHEN WE REPASSED HIS DOOR WITH NO
APPEARANCE OF HAVING CEASED OR OF MEANING TO CEASE WHEN WE GOT TO THE
FOOT OF THE STAIRS I ASKED HERBERT WHETHER HE HAD PRESERVED THE NAME
OF PROVIS HE REPLIED CERTAINLY NOT AND THAT THE LODGER WAS MR
CAMPBELL HE ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THE UTMOST KNOWN OF MR CAMPBELL THERE
WAS THAT HE HERBERT HAD MR CAMPBELL CONSIGNED TO HIM AND FELT A
STRONG PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS BEING WELL CARED FOR AND LIVING A
SECLUDED LIFE SO WHEN WE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR WHERE MRS WHIMPLE AND
CLARA WERE SEATED AT WORK I SAID NOTHING OF MY OWN INTEREST IN MR
CAMPBELL BUT KEPT IT TO MYSELF

WHEN I HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THE PRETTY GENTLE DARKEYED GIRL AND OF
THE MOTHERLY WOMAN WHO HAD NOT OUTLIVED HER HONEST SYMPATHY WITH A
LITTLE AFFAIR OF TRUE LOVE I FELT AS IF THE OLD GREEN COPPER ROPEWALK
HAD GROWN QUITE A DIFFERENT PLACE OLD BARLEY MIGHT BE AS OLD AS THE
HILLS AND MIGHT SWEAR LIKE A WHOLE FIELD OF TROOPERS BUT THERE WERE
REDEEMING YOUTH AND TRUST AND HOPE ENOUGH IN CHINKSS BASIN TO FILL IT
TO OVERFLOWING AND THEN I THOUGHT OF ESTELLA AND OF OUR PARTING AND
WENT HOME VERY SADLY

ALL THINGS WERE AS QUIET IN THE TEMPLE AS EVER I HAD SEEN THEM THE
WINDOWS OF THE ROOMS ON THAT SIDE LATELY OCCUPIED BY PROVIS WERE DARK
AND STILL AND THERE WAS NO LOUNGER IN GARDEN COURT I WALKED PAST THE
FOUNTAIN TWICE OR THRICE BEFORE I DESCENDED THE STEPS THAT WERE BETWEEN
ME AND MY ROOMS BUT I WAS QUITE ALONE HERBERT COMING TO MY BEDSIDE
WHEN HE CAME INFOR I WENT STRAIGHT TO BED DISPIRITED AND
FATIGUEDMADE THE SAME REPORT OPENING ONE OF THE WINDOWS AFTER THAT
HE LOOKED OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT AND TOLD ME THAT THE PAVEMENT WAS AS
SOLEMNLY EMPTY AS THE PAVEMENT OF ANY CATHEDRAL AT THAT SAME HOUR

NEXT DAY I SET MYSELF TO GET THE BOAT IT WAS SOON DONE AND THE BOAT
WAS BROUGHT ROUND TO THE TEMPLE STAIRS AND LAY WHERE I COULD REACH HER
WITHIN A MINUTE OR TWO THEN I BEGAN TO GO OUT AS FOR TRAINING AND
PRACTICE SOMETIMES ALONE SOMETIMES WITH HERBERT I WAS OFTEN OUT IN
COLD RAIN AND SLEET BUT NOBODY TOOK MUCH NOTE OF ME AFTER I HAD BEEN
OUT A FEW TIMES AT FIRST I KEPT ABOVE BLACKFRIARS BRIDGE BUT AS THE
HOURS OF THE TIDE CHANGED I TOOK TOWARDS LONDON BRIDGE IT WAS OLD
LONDON BRIDGE IN THOSE DAYS AND AT CERTAIN STATES OF THE TIDE THERE
WAS A RACE AND FALL OF WATER THERE WHICH GAVE IT A BAD REPUTATION BUT
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH HOW TO SHOOT THE BRIDGE AFTER SEEING IT DONE AND
SO BEGAN TO ROW ABOUT AMONG THE SHIPPING IN THE POOL AND DOWN TO
ERITH THE FIRST TIME I PASSED MILL POND BANK HERBERT AND I WERE
PULLING A PAIR OF OARS AND BOTH IN GOING AND RETURNING WE SAW THE
BLIND TOWARDS THE EAST COME DOWN HERBERT WAS RARELY THERE LESS
FREQUENTLY THAN THREE TIMES IN A WEEK AND HE NEVER BROUGHT ME A SINGLE
WORD OF INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS AT ALL ALARMING STILL I KNEW THAT THERE
WAS CAUSE FOR ALARM AND I COULD NOT GET RID OF THE NOTION OF BEING
WATCHED ONCE RECEIVED IT IS A HAUNTING IDEA HOW MANY UNDESIGNING
PERSONS I SUSPECTED OF WATCHING ME IT WOULD BE HARD TO CALCULATE

IN SHORT I WAS ALWAYS FULL OF FEARS FOR THE RASH MAN WHO WAS IN
HIDING HERBERT HAD SOMETIMES SAID TO ME THAT HE FOUND IT PLEASANT TO
STAND AT ONE OF OUR WINDOWS AFTER DARK WHEN THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN
AND TO THINK THAT IT WAS FLOWING WITH EVERYTHING IT BORE TOWARDS
CLARA BUT I THOUGHT WITH DREAD THAT IT WAS FLOWING TOWARDS MAGWITCH
AND THAT ANY BLACK MARK ON ITS SURFACE MIGHT BE HIS PURSUERS GOING
SWIFTLY SILENTLY AND SURELY TO TAKE HIM




CHAPTER XLVII


SOME WEEKS PASSED WITHOUT BRINGING ANY CHANGE WE WAITED FOR WEMMICK
AND HE MADE NO SIGN IF I HAD NEVER KNOWN HIM OUT OF LITTLE BRITAIN
AND HAD NEVER ENJOYED THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ON A FAMILIAR FOOTING AT
THE CASTLE I MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED HIM NOT SO FOR A MOMENT KNOWING HIM
AS I DID

MY WORLDLY AFFAIRS BEGAN TO WEAR A GLOOMY APPEARANCE AND I WAS PRESSED
FOR MONEY BY MORE THAN ONE CREDITOR EVEN I MYSELF BEGAN TO KNOW THE
WANT OF MONEY I MEAN OF READY MONEY IN MY OWN POCKET AND TO RELIEVE
IT BY CONVERTING SOME EASILY SPARED ARTICLES OF JEWELERY INTO CASH BUT
I HAD QUITE DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE A HEARTLESS FRAUD TO TAKE MORE
MONEY FROM MY PATRON IN THE EXISTING STATE OF MY UNCERTAIN THOUGHTS AND
PLANS THEREFORE I HAD SENT HIM THE UNOPENED POCKETBOOK BY HERBERT
TO HOLD IN HIS OWN KEEPING AND I FELT A KIND OF SATISFACTIONWHETHER
IT WAS A FALSE KIND OR A TRUE I HARDLY KNOWIN NOT HAVING PROFITED BY
HIS GENEROSITY SINCE HIS REVELATION OF HIMSELF

AS THE TIME WORE ON AN IMPRESSION SETTLED HEAVILY UPON ME THAT ESTELLA
WAS MARRIED FEARFUL OF HAVING IT CONFIRMED THOUGH IT WAS ALL BUT A
CONVICTION I AVOIDED THE NEWSPAPERS AND BEGGED HERBERT TO WHOM I HAD
CONFIDED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR LAST INTERVIEW NEVER TO SPEAK OF HER
TO ME WHY I HOARDED UP THIS LAST WRETCHED LITTLE RAG OF THE ROBE OF
HOPE THAT WAS RENT AND GIVEN TO THE WINDS HOW DO I KNOW WHY DID YOU
WHO READ THIS COMMIT THAT NOT DISSIMILAR INCONSISTENCY OF YOUR OWN
LAST YEAR LAST MONTH LAST WEEK

IT WAS AN UNHAPPY LIFE THAT I LIVED AND ITS ONE DOMINANT ANXIETY
TOWERING OVER ALL ITS OTHER ANXIETIES LIKE A HIGH MOUNTAIN ABOVE A
RANGE OF MOUNTAINS NEVER DISAPPEARED FROM MY VIEW STILL NO NEW CAUSE
FOR FEAR AROSE LET ME START FROM MY BED AS I WOULD WITH THE TERROR
FRESH UPON ME THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED LET ME SIT LISTENING AS I WOULD
WITH DREAD FOR HERBERTS RETURNING STEP AT NIGHT LEST IT SHOULD BE
FLEETER THAN ORDINARY AND WINGED WITH EVIL NEWSFOR ALL THAT AND
MUCH MORE TO LIKE PURPOSE THE ROUND OF THINGS WENT ON CONDEMNED TO
INACTION AND A STATE OF CONSTANT RESTLESSNESS AND SUSPENSE I ROWED
ABOUT IN MY BOAT AND WAITED WAITED WAITED AS I BEST COULD

THERE WERE STATES OF THE TIDE WHEN HAVING BEEN DOWN THE RIVER I COULD
NOT GET BACK THROUGH THE EDDYCHAFED ARCHES AND STARLINGS OF OLD LONDON
BRIDGE THEN I LEFT MY BOAT AT A WHARF NEAR THE CUSTOM HOUSE TO BE
BROUGHT UP AFTERWARDS TO THE TEMPLE STAIRS I WAS NOT AVERSE TO DOING
THIS AS IT SERVED TO MAKE ME AND MY BOAT A COMMONER INCIDENT AMONG THE
WATERSIDE PEOPLE THERE FROM THIS SLIGHT OCCASION SPRANG TWO MEETINGS
THAT I HAVE NOW TO TELL OF

ONE AFTERNOON LATE IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY I CAME ASHORE AT THE
WHARF AT DUSK I HAD PULLED DOWN AS FAR AS GREENWICH WITH THE EBB TIDE
AND HAD TURNED WITH THE TIDE IT HAD BEEN A FINE BRIGHT DAY BUT HAD
BECOME FOGGY AS THE SUN DROPPED AND I HAD HAD TO FEEL MY WAY BACK
AMONG THE SHIPPING PRETTY CAREFULLY BOTH IN GOING AND RETURNING I
HAD SEEN THE SIGNAL IN HIS WINDOW ALL WELL

AS IT WAS A RAW EVENING AND I WAS COLD I THOUGHT I WOULD COMFORT
MYSELF WITH DINNER AT ONCE AND AS I HAD HOURS OF DEJECTION AND
SOLITUDE BEFORE ME IF I WENT HOME TO THE TEMPLE I THOUGHT I WOULD
AFTERWARDS GO TO THE PLAY THE THEATRE WHERE MR WOPSLE HAD ACHIEVED
HIS QUESTIONABLE TRIUMPH WAS IN THAT WATERSIDE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT IS
NOWHERE NOW AND TO THAT THEATRE I RESOLVED TO GO I WAS AWARE THAT
MR WOPSLE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN REVIVING THE DRAMA BUT ON THE
CONTRARY HAD RATHER PARTAKEN OF ITS DECLINE HE HAD BEEN OMINOUSLY
HEARD OF THROUGH THE PLAYBILLS AS A FAITHFUL BLACK IN CONNECTION
WITH A LITTLE GIRL OF NOBLE BIRTH AND A MONKEY AND HERBERT HAD SEEN
HIM AS A PREDATORY TARTAR OF COMIC PROPENSITIES WITH A FACE LIKE A RED
BRICK AND AN OUTRAGEOUS HAT ALL OVER BELLS

I DINED AT WHAT HERBERT AND I USED TO CALL A GEOGRAPHICAL CHOPHOUSE
WHERE THERE WERE MAPS OF THE WORLD IN PORTERPOT RIMS ON EVERY
HALFYARD OF THE TABLECLOTHS AND CHARTS OF GRAVY ON EVERY ONE OF THE
KNIVESTO THIS DAY THERE IS SCARCELY A SINGLE CHOPHOUSE WITHIN THE
LORD MAYORS DOMINIONS WHICH IS NOT GEOGRAPHICALAND WORE OUT THE TIME
IN DOZING OVER CRUMBS STARING AT GAS AND BAKING IN A HOT BLAST OF
DINNERS BY AND BY I ROUSED MYSELF AND WENT TO THE PLAY

THERE I FOUND A VIRTUOUS BOATSWAIN IN HIS MAJESTYS SERVICEA MOST
EXCELLENT MAN THOUGH I COULD HAVE WISHED HIS TROUSERS NOT QUITE SO
TIGHT IN SOME PLACES AND NOT QUITE SO LOOSE IN OTHERSWHO KNOCKED ALL
THE LITTLE MENS HATS OVER THEIR EYES THOUGH HE WAS VERY GENEROUS AND
BRAVE AND WHO WOULDNT HEAR OF ANYBODYS PAYING TAXES THOUGH HE WAS
VERY PATRIOTIC HE HAD A BAG OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET LIKE A PUDDING IN
THE CLOTH AND ON THAT PROPERTY MARRIED A YOUNG PERSON IN
BEDFURNITURE WITH GREAT REJOICINGS THE WHOLE POPULATION OF
PORTSMOUTH NINE IN NUMBER AT THE LAST CENSUS TURNING OUT ON THE BEACH
TO RUB THEIR OWN HANDS AND SHAKE EVERYBODY ELSES AND SING FILL
FILL A CERTAIN DARKCOMPLEXIONED SWAB HOWEVER WHO WOULDNT FILL OR
DO ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS PROPOSED TO HIM AND WHOSE HEART WAS OPENLY
STATED BY THE BOATSWAIN TO BE AS BLACK AS HIS FIGUREHEAD PROPOSED
TO TWO OTHER SWABS TO GET ALL MANKIND INTO DIFFICULTIES WHICH WAS SO
EFFECTUALLY DONE THE SWAB FAMILY HAVING CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL
INFLUENCE THAT IT TOOK HALF THE EVENING TO SET THINGS RIGHT AND THEN
IT WAS ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH AN HONEST LITTLE GROCER WITH A WHITE
HAT BLACK GAITERS AND RED NOSE GETTING INTO A CLOCK WITH A
GRIDIRON AND LISTENING AND COMING OUT AND KNOCKING EVERYBODY DOWN
FROM BEHIND WITH THE GRIDIRON WHOM HE COULDNT CONFUTE WITH WHAT HE HAD
OVERHEARD THIS LED TO MR WOPSLES WHO HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF
BEFORE COMING IN WITH A STAR AND GARTER ON AS A PLENIPOTENTIARY OF
GREAT POWER DIRECT FROM THE ADMIRALTY TO SAY THAT THE SWABS WERE ALL
TO GO TO PRISON ON THE SPOT AND THAT HE HAD BROUGHT THE BOATSWAIN DOWN
THE UNION JACK AS A SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS PUBLIC SERVICES THE
BOATSWAIN UNMANNED FOR THE FIRST TIME RESPECTFULLY DRIED HIS EYES ON
THE JACK AND THEN CHEERING UP AND ADDRESSING MR WOPSLE AS YOUR
HONOUR SOLICITED PERMISSION TO TAKE HIM BY THE FIN MR WOPSLE
CONCEDING HIS FIN WITH A GRACIOUS DIGNITY WAS IMMEDIATELY SHOVED INTO
A DUSTY CORNER WHILE EVERYBODY DANCED A HORNPIPE AND FROM THAT
CORNER SURVEYING THE PUBLIC WITH A DISCONTENTED EYE BECAME AWARE OF
ME

THE SECOND PIECE WAS THE LAST NEW GRAND COMIC CHRISTMAS PANTOMIME IN
THE FIRST SCENE OF WHICH IT PAINED ME TO SUSPECT THAT I DETECTED MR
WOPSLE WITH RED WORSTED LEGS UNDER A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED PHOSPHORIC
COUNTENANCE AND A SHOCK OF RED CURTAINFRINGE FOR HIS HAIR ENGAGED IN
THE MANUFACTURE OF THUNDERBOLTS IN A MINE AND DISPLAYING GREAT
COWARDICE WHEN HIS GIGANTIC MASTER CAME HOME VERY HOARSE TO DINNER
BUT HE PRESENTLY PRESENTED HIMSELF UNDER WORTHIER CIRCUMSTANCES FOR
THE GENIUS OF YOUTHFUL LOVE BEING IN WANT OF ASSISTANCEON ACCOUNT OF
THE PARENTAL BRUTALITY OF AN IGNORANT FARMER WHO OPPOSED THE CHOICE OF
HIS DAUGHTERS HEART BY PURPOSELY FALLING UPON THE OBJECT IN A
FLOURSACK OUT OF THE FIRSTFLOOR WINDOWSUMMONED A SENTENTIOUS
ENCHANTER AND HE COMING UP FROM THE ANTIPODES RATHER UNSTEADILY
AFTER AN APPARENTLY VIOLENT JOURNEY PROVED TO BE MR WOPSLE IN A
HIGHCROWNED HAT WITH A NECROMANTIC WORK IN ONE VOLUME UNDER HIS ARM
THE BUSINESS OF THIS ENCHANTER ON EARTH BEING PRINCIPALLY TO BE TALKED
AT SUNG AT BUTTED AT DANCED AT AND FLASHED AT WITH FIRES OF VARIOUS
COLOURS HE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ON HIS HANDS AND I OBSERVED WITH
GREAT SURPRISE THAT HE DEVOTED IT TO STARING IN MY DIRECTION AS IF HE
WERE LOST IN AMAZEMENT

THERE WAS SOMETHING SO REMARKABLE IN THE INCREASING GLARE OF MR
WOPSLES EYE AND HE SEEMED TO BE TURNING SO MANY THINGS OVER IN HIS
MIND AND TO GROW SO CONFUSED THAT I COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT I SAT
THINKING OF IT LONG AFTER HE HAD ASCENDED TO THE CLOUDS IN A LARGE
WATCHCASE AND STILL I COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT I WAS STILL THINKING OF
IT WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE THEATRE AN HOUR AFTERWARDS AND FOUND HIM
WAITING FOR ME NEAR THE DOOR

HOW DO YOU DO SAID I SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM AS WE TURNED DOWN THE
STREET TOGETHER I SAW THAT YOU SAW ME

SAW YOU MR PIP HE RETURNED YES OF COURSE I SAW YOU BUT WHO
ELSE WAS THERE

WHO ELSE

IT IS THE STRANGEST THING SAID MR WOPSLE DRIFTING INTO HIS LOST
LOOK AGAIN AND YET I COULD SWEAR TO HIM

BECOMING ALARMED I ENTREATED MR WOPSLE TO EXPLAIN HIS MEANING

WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE NOTICED HIM AT FIRST BUT FOR YOUR BEING THERE
SAID MR WOPSLE GOING ON IN THE SAME LOST WAY I CANT BE POSITIVE
YET I THINK I SHOULD

INVOLUNTARILY I LOOKED ROUND ME AS I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK ROUND ME
WHEN I WENT HOME FOR THESE MYSTERIOUS WORDS GAVE ME A CHILL

OH HE CANT BE IN SIGHT SAID MR WOPSLE HE WENT OUT BEFORE I WENT
OFF I SAW HIM GO

HAVING THE REASON THAT I HAD FOR BEING SUSPICIOUS I EVEN SUSPECTED
THIS POOR ACTOR I MISTRUSTED A DESIGN TO ENTRAP ME INTO SOME
ADMISSION THEREFORE I GLANCED AT HIM AS WE WALKED ON TOGETHER BUT
SAID NOTHING

I HAD A RIDICULOUS FANCY THAT HE MUST BE WITH YOU MR PIP TILL I SAW
THAT YOU WERE QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HIM SITTING BEHIND YOU THERE LIKE A
GHOST

MY FORMER CHILL CREPT OVER ME AGAIN BUT I WAS RESOLVED NOT TO SPEAK
YET FOR IT WAS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH HIS WORDS THAT HE MIGHT BE SET ON
TO INDUCE ME TO CONNECT THESE REFERENCES WITH PROVIS OF COURSE I WAS
PERFECTLY SURE AND SAFE THAT PROVIS HAD NOT BEEN THERE

I DARE SAY YOU WONDER AT ME MR PIP INDEED I SEE YOU DO BUT IT IS
SO VERY STRANGE YOULL HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU I
COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT MYSELF IF YOU TOLD ME

INDEED SAID I

NO INDEED MR PIP YOU REMEMBER IN OLD TIMES A CERTAIN CHRISTMAS
DAY WHEN YOU WERE QUITE A CHILD AND I DINED AT GARGERYS AND SOME
SOLDIERS CAME TO THE DOOR TO GET A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS MENDED

I REMEMBER IT VERY WELL

AND YOU REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A CHASE AFTER TWO CONVICTS AND THAT
WE JOINED IN IT AND THAT GARGERY TOOK YOU ON HIS BACK AND THAT I TOOK
THE LEAD AND YOU KEPT UP WITH ME AS WELL AS YOU COULD

I REMEMBER IT ALL VERY WELL BETTER THAN HE THOUGHTEXCEPT THE LAST
CLAUSE

AND YOU REMEMBER THAT WE CAME UP WITH THE TWO IN A DITCH AND THAT
THERE WAS A SCUFFLE BETWEEN THEM AND THAT ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN
SEVERELY HANDLED AND MUCH MAULED ABOUT THE FACE BY THE OTHER

I SEE IT ALL BEFORE ME

AND THAT THE SOLDIERS LIGHTED TORCHES AND PUT THE TWO IN THE CENTRE
AND THAT WE WENT ON TO SEE THE LAST OF THEM OVER THE BLACK MARSHES
WITH THE TORCHLIGHT SHINING ON THEIR FACESI AM PARTICULAR ABOUT
THATWITH THE TORCHLIGHT SHINING ON THEIR FACES WHEN THERE WAS AN
OUTER RING OF DARK NIGHT ALL ABOUT US

YES SAID I I REMEMBER ALL THAT

THEN MR PIP ONE OF THOSE TWO PRISONERS SAT BEHIND YOU TONIGHT I
SAW HIM OVER YOUR SHOULDER

STEADY I THOUGHT I ASKED HIM THEN WHICH OF THE TWO DO YOU SUPPOSE
YOU SAW

THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN MAULED HE ANSWERED READILY AND ILL SWEAR I
SAW HIM THE MORE I THINK OF HIM THE MORE CERTAIN I AM OF HIM

THIS IS VERY CURIOUS SAID I WITH THE BEST ASSUMPTION I COULD PUT ON
OF ITS BEING NOTHING MORE TO ME VERY CURIOUS INDEED

I CANNOT EXAGGERATE THE ENHANCED DISQUIET INTO WHICH THIS CONVERSATION
THREW ME OR THE SPECIAL AND PECULIAR TERROR I FELT AT COMPEYSONS
HAVING BEEN BEHIND ME LIKE A GHOST FOR IF HE HAD EVER BEEN OUT OF MY
THOUGHTS FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER SINCE THE HIDING HAD BEGUN IT WAS
IN THOSE VERY MOMENTS WHEN HE WAS CLOSEST TO ME AND TO THINK THAT I
SHOULD BE SO UNCONSCIOUS AND OFF MY GUARD AFTER ALL MY CARE WAS AS IF I
HAD SHUT AN AVENUE OF A HUNDRED DOORS TO KEEP HIM OUT AND THEN HAD
FOUND HIM AT MY ELBOW I COULD NOT DOUBT EITHER THAT HE WAS THERE
BECAUSE I WAS THERE AND THAT HOWEVER SLIGHT AN APPEARANCE OF DANGER
THERE MIGHT BE ABOUT US DANGER WAS ALWAYS NEAR AND ACTIVE

I PUT SUCH QUESTIONS TO MR WOPSLE AS WHEN DID THE MAN COME IN HE
COULD NOT TELL ME THAT HE SAW ME AND OVER MY SHOULDER HE SAW THE MAN
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD SEEN HIM FOR SOME TIME THAT HE BEGAN TO
IDENTIFY HIM BUT HE HAD FROM THE FIRST VAGUELY ASSOCIATED HIM WITH ME
AND KNOWN HIM AS SOMEHOW BELONGING TO ME IN THE OLD VILLAGE TIME HOW
WAS HE DRESSED PROSPEROUSLY BUT NOT NOTICEABLY OTHERWISE HE THOUGHT
IN BLACK WAS HIS FACE AT ALL DISFIGURED NO HE BELIEVED NOT I
BELIEVED NOT TOO FOR ALTHOUGH IN MY BROODING STATE I HAD TAKEN NO
ESPECIAL NOTICE OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME I THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT A
FACE AT ALL DISFIGURED WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION

WHEN MR WOPSLE HAD IMPARTED TO ME ALL THAT HE COULD RECALL OR I
EXTRACT AND WHEN I HAD TREATED HIM TO A LITTLE APPROPRIATE
REFRESHMENT AFTER THE FATIGUES OF THE EVENING WE PARTED IT WAS
BETWEEN TWELVE AND ONE OCLOCK WHEN I REACHED THE TEMPLE AND THE GATES
WERE SHUT NO ONE WAS NEAR ME WHEN I WENT IN AND WENT HOME

HERBERT HAD COME IN AND WE HELD A VERY SERIOUS COUNCIL BY THE FIRE
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE SAVING TO COMMUNICATE TO WEMMICK WHAT
I HAD THAT NIGHT FOUND OUT AND TO REMIND HIM THAT WE WAITED FOR HIS
HINT AS I THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT COMPROMISE HIM IF I WENT TOO OFTEN TO
THE CASTLE I MADE THIS COMMUNICATION BY LETTER I WROTE IT BEFORE I
WENT TO BED AND WENT OUT AND POSTED IT AND AGAIN NO ONE WAS NEAR ME
HERBERT AND I AGREED THAT WE COULD DO NOTHING ELSE BUT BE VERY
CAUTIOUS AND WE WERE VERY CAUTIOUS INDEEDMORE CAUTIOUS THAN BEFORE
IF THAT WERE POSSIBLEAND I FOR MY PART NEVER WENT NEAR CHINKSS
BASIN EXCEPT WHEN I ROWED BY AND THEN I ONLY LOOKED AT MILL POND BANK
AS I LOOKED AT ANYTHING ELSE




CHAPTER XLVIII


THE SECOND OF THE TWO MEETINGS REFERRED TO IN THE LAST CHAPTER OCCURRED
ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE FIRST I HAD AGAIN LEFT MY BOAT AT THE WHARF
BELOW BRIDGE THE TIME WAS AN HOUR EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON AND
UNDECIDED WHERE TO DINE I HAD STROLLED UP INTO CHEAPSIDE AND WAS
STROLLING ALONG IT SURELY THE MOST UNSETTLED PERSON IN ALL THE BUSY
CONCOURSE WHEN A LARGE HAND WAS LAID UPON MY SHOULDER BY SOME ONE
OVERTAKING ME IT WAS MR JAGGERSS HAND AND HE PASSED IT THROUGH MY
ARM

AS WE ARE GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION PIP WE MAY WALK TOGETHER
WHERE ARE YOU BOUND FOR

FOR THE TEMPLE I THINK SAID I

DONT YOU KNOW SAID MR JAGGERS

WELL I RETURNED GLAD FOR ONCE TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM IN
CROSSEXAMINATION I DO NOT KNOW FOR I HAVE NOT MADE UP MY MIND

YOU ARE GOING TO DINE SAID MR JAGGERS YOU DONT MIND ADMITTING
THAT I SUPPOSE

NO I RETURNED I DONT MIND ADMITTING THAT

AND ARE NOT ENGAGED

I DONT MIND ADMITTING ALSO THAT I AM NOT ENGAGED

THEN SAID MR JAGGERS COME AND DINE WITH ME

I WAS GOING TO EXCUSE MYSELF WHEN HE ADDED WEMMICKS COMING SO I
CHANGED MY EXCUSE INTO AN ACCEPTANCETHE FEW WORDS I HAD UTTERED
SERVING FOR THE BEGINNING OF EITHERAND WE WENT ALONG CHEAPSIDE AND
SLANTED OFF TO LITTLE BRITAIN WHILE THE LIGHTS WERE SPRINGING UP
BRILLIANTLY IN THE SHOP WINDOWS AND THE STREET LAMPLIGHTERS SCARCELY
FINDING GROUND ENOUGH TO PLANT THEIR LADDERS ON IN THE MIDST OF THE
AFTERNOONS BUSTLE WERE SKIPPING UP AND DOWN AND RUNNING IN AND OUT
OPENING MORE RED EYES IN THE GATHERING FOG THAN MY RUSHLIGHT TOWER AT
THE HUMMUMS HAD OPENED WHITE EYES IN THE GHOSTLY WALL

AT THE OFFICE IN LITTLE BRITAIN THERE WAS THE USUAL LETTERWRITING
HANDWASHING CANDLESNUFFING AND SAFELOCKING THAT CLOSED THE
BUSINESS OF THE DAY AS I STOOD IDLE BY MR JAGGERSS FIRE ITS RISING
AND FALLING FLAME MADE THE TWO CASTS ON THE SHELF LOOK AS IF THEY WERE
PLAYING A DIABOLICAL GAME AT BOPEEP WITH ME WHILE THE PAIR OF COARSE
FAT OFFICE CANDLES THAT DIMLY LIGHTED MR JAGGERS AS HE WROTE IN A
CORNER WERE DECORATED WITH DIRTY WINDINGSHEETS AS IF IN REMEMBRANCE
OF A HOST OF HANGED CLIENTS

WE WENT TO GERRARD STREET ALL THREE TOGETHER IN A HACKNEYCOACH AND
AS SOON AS WE GOT THERE DINNER WAS SERVED ALTHOUGH I SHOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT OF MAKING IN THAT PLACE THE MOST DISTANT REFERENCE BY SO MUCH
AS A LOOK TO WEMMICKS WALWORTH SENTIMENTS YET I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO
OBJECTION TO CATCHING HIS EYE NOW AND THEN IN A FRIENDLY WAY BUT IT
WAS NOT TO BE DONE HE TURNED HIS EYES ON MR JAGGERS WHENEVER HE
RAISED THEM FROM THE TABLE AND WAS AS DRY AND DISTANT TO ME AS IF
THERE WERE TWIN WEMMICKS AND THIS WAS THE WRONG ONE

DID YOU SEND THAT NOTE OF MISS HAVISHAMS TO MR PIP WEMMICK MR
JAGGERS ASKED SOON AFTER WE BEGAN DINNER

NO SIR RETURNED WEMMICK IT WAS GOING BY POST WHEN YOU BROUGHT
MR PIP INTO THE OFFICE HERE IT IS HE HANDED IT TO HIS PRINCIPAL
INSTEAD OF TO ME

ITS A NOTE OF TWO LINES PIP SAID MR JAGGERS HANDING IT ON SENT
UP TO ME BY MISS HAVISHAM ON ACCOUNT OF HER NOT BEING SURE OF YOUR
ADDRESS SHE TELLS ME THAT SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU ON A LITTLE MATTER OF
BUSINESS YOU MENTIONED TO HER YOULL GO DOWN

YES SAID I CASTING MY EYES OVER THE NOTE WHICH WAS EXACTLY IN
THOSE TERMS

WHEN DO YOU THINK OF GOING DOWN

I HAVE AN IMPENDING ENGAGEMENT SAID I GLANCING AT WEMMICK WHO WAS
PUTTING FISH INTO THE POSTOFFICE THAT RENDERS ME RATHER UNCERTAIN OF
MY TIME AT ONCE I THINK

IF MR PIP HAS THE INTENTION OF GOING AT ONCE SAID WEMMICK TO MR
JAGGERS HE NEEDNT WRITE AN ANSWER YOU KNOW

RECEIVING THIS AS AN INTIMATION THAT IT WAS BEST NOT TO DELAY I
SETTLED THAT I WOULD GO TOMORROW AND SAID SO WEMMICK DRANK A GLASS
OF WINE AND LOOKED WITH A GRIMLY SATISFIED AIR AT MR JAGGERS BUT NOT
AT ME

SO PIP OUR FRIEND THE SPIDER SAID MR JAGGERS HAS PLAYED HIS
CARDS HE HAS WON THE POOL

IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO ASSENT

HAH HE IS A PROMISING FELLOWIN HIS WAYBUT HE MAY NOT HAVE IT ALL
HIS OWN WAY THE STRONGER WILL WIN IN THE END BUT THE STRONGER HAS TO
BE FOUND OUT FIRST IF HE SHOULD TURN TO AND BEAT HER

SURELY I INTERRUPTED WITH A BURNING FACE AND HEART YOU DO NOT
SERIOUSLY THINK THAT HE IS SCOUNDREL ENOUGH FOR THAT MR JAGGERS

I DIDNT SAY SO PIP I AM PUTTING A CASE IF HE SHOULD TURN TO AND
BEAT HER HE MAY POSSIBLY GET THE STRENGTH ON HIS SIDE IF IT SHOULD BE
A QUESTION OF INTELLECT HE CERTAINLY WILL NOT IT WOULD BE CHANCE WORK
TO GIVE AN OPINION HOW A FELLOW OF THAT SORT WILL TURN OUT IN SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE ITS A TOSSUP BETWEEN TWO RESULTS

MAY I ASK WHAT THEY ARE

A FELLOW LIKE OUR FRIEND THE SPIDER ANSWERED MR JAGGERS EITHER
BEATS OR CRINGES HE MAY CRINGE AND GROWL OR CRINGE AND NOT GROWL BUT
HE EITHER BEATS OR CRINGES ASK WEMMICK HIS OPINION

EITHER BEATS OR CRINGES SAID WEMMICK NOT AT ALL ADDRESSING HIMSELF
TO ME

SO HERES TO MRS BENTLEY DRUMMLE SAID MR JAGGERS TAKING A
DECANTER OF CHOICER WINE FROM HIS DUMBWAITER AND FILLING FOR EACH OF
US AND FOR HIMSELF AND MAY THE QUESTION OF SUPREMACY BE SETTLED TO
THE LADYS SATISFACTION TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE LADY AND THE
GENTLEMAN IT NEVER WILL BE NOW MOLLY MOLLY MOLLY MOLLY HOW SLOW
YOU ARE TODAY

SHE WAS AT HIS ELBOW WHEN HE ADDRESSED HER PUTTING A DISH UPON THE
TABLE AS SHE WITHDREW HER HANDS FROM IT SHE FELL BACK A STEP OR TWO
NERVOUSLY MUTTERING SOME EXCUSE AND A CERTAIN ACTION OF HER FINGERS
AS SHE SPOKE ARRESTED MY ATTENTION

WHATS THE MATTER SAID MR JAGGERS

NOTHING ONLY THE SUBJECT WE WERE SPEAKING OF SAID I WAS RATHER
PAINFUL TO ME

THE ACTION OF HER FINGERS WAS LIKE THE ACTION OF KNITTING SHE STOOD
LOOKING AT HER MASTER NOT UNDERSTANDING WHETHER SHE WAS FREE TO GO OR
WHETHER HE HAD MORE TO SAY TO HER AND WOULD CALL HER BACK IF SHE DID
GO HER LOOK WAS VERY INTENT SURELY I HAD SEEN EXACTLY SUCH EYES AND
SUCH HANDS ON A MEMORABLE OCCASION VERY LATELY

HE DISMISSED HER AND SHE GLIDED OUT OF THE ROOM BUT SHE REMAINED
BEFORE ME AS PLAINLY AS IF SHE WERE STILL THERE I LOOKED AT THOSE
HANDS I LOOKED AT THOSE EYES I LOOKED AT THAT FLOWING HAIR AND I
COMPARED THEM WITH OTHER HANDS OTHER EYES OTHER HAIR THAT I KNEW OF
AND WITH WHAT THOSE MIGHT BE AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF A BRUTAL HUSBAND AND
A STORMY LIFE I LOOKED AGAIN AT THOSE HANDS AND EYES OF THE
HOUSEKEEPER AND THOUGHT OF THE INEXPLICABLE FEELING THAT HAD COME OVER
ME WHEN I LAST WALKEDNOT ALONEIN THE RUINED GARDEN AND THROUGH THE
DESERTED BREWERY I THOUGHT HOW THE SAME FEELING HAD COME BACK WHEN I
SAW A FACE LOOKING AT ME AND A HAND WAVING TO ME FROM A STAGECOACH
WINDOW AND HOW IT HAD COME BACK AGAIN AND HAD FLASHED ABOUT ME LIKE
LIGHTNING WHEN I HAD PASSED IN A CARRIAGENOT ALONETHROUGH A SUDDEN
GLARE OF LIGHT IN A DARK STREET I THOUGHT HOW ONE LINK OF ASSOCIATION
HAD HELPED THAT IDENTIFICATION IN THE THEATRE AND HOW SUCH A LINK
WANTING BEFORE HAD BEEN RIVETED FOR ME NOW WHEN I HAD PASSED BY A
CHANCE SWIFT FROM ESTELLAS NAME TO THE FINGERS WITH THEIR KNITTING
ACTION AND THE ATTENTIVE EYES AND I FELT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THIS
WOMAN WAS ESTELLAS MOTHER

MR JAGGERS HAD SEEN ME WITH ESTELLA AND WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE MISSED
THE SENTIMENTS I HAD BEEN AT NO PAINS TO CONCEAL HE NODDED WHEN I SAID
THE SUBJECT WAS PAINFUL TO ME CLAPPED ME ON THE BACK PUT ROUND THE
WINE AGAIN AND WENT ON WITH HIS DINNER

ONLY TWICE MORE DID THE HOUSEKEEPER REAPPEAR AND THEN HER STAY IN THE
ROOM WAS VERY SHORT AND MR JAGGERS WAS SHARP WITH HER BUT HER HANDS
WERE ESTELLAS HANDS AND HER EYES WERE ESTELLAS EYES AND IF SHE HAD
REAPPEARED A HUNDRED TIMES I COULD HAVE BEEN NEITHER MORE SURE NOR LESS
SURE THAT MY CONVICTION WAS THE TRUTH

IT WAS A DULL EVENING FOR WEMMICK DREW HIS WINE WHEN IT CAME ROUND
QUITE AS A MATTER OF BUSINESSJUST AS HE MIGHT HAVE DRAWN HIS SALARY
WHEN THAT CAME ROUNDAND WITH HIS EYES ON HIS CHIEF SAT IN A STATE OF
PERPETUAL READINESS FOR CROSSEXAMINATION AS TO THE QUANTITY OF WINE
HIS POSTOFFICE WAS AS INDIFFERENT AND READY AS ANY OTHER POSTOFFICE
FOR ITS QUANTITY OF LETTERS FROM MY POINT OF VIEW HE WAS THE WRONG
TWIN ALL THE TIME AND ONLY EXTERNALLY LIKE THE WEMMICK OF WALWORTH

WE TOOK OUR LEAVE EARLY AND LEFT TOGETHER EVEN WHEN WE WERE GROPING
AMONG MR JAGGERSS STOCK OF BOOTS FOR OUR HATS I FELT THAT THE RIGHT
TWIN WAS ON HIS WAY BACK AND WE HAD NOT GONE HALF A DOZEN YARDS DOWN
GERRARD STREET IN THE WALWORTH DIRECTION BEFORE I FOUND THAT I WAS
WALKING ARM IN ARM WITH THE RIGHT TWIN AND THAT THE WRONG TWIN HAD
EVAPORATED INTO THE EVENING AIR

WELL SAID WEMMICK THATS OVER HES A WONDERFUL MAN WITHOUT HIS
LIVING LIKENESS BUT I FEEL THAT I HAVE TO SCREW MYSELF UP WHEN I DINE
WITH HIMAND I DINE MORE COMFORTABLY UNSCREWED

I FELT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND TOLD HIM SO

WOULDNT SAY IT TO ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF HE ANSWERED I KNOW THAT
WHAT IS SAID BETWEEN YOU AND ME GOES NO FURTHER

I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER SEEN MISS HAVISHAMS ADOPTED DAUGHTER MRS
BENTLEY DRUMMLE HE SAID NO TO AVOID BEING TOO ABRUPT I THEN SPOKE OF
THE AGED AND OF MISS SKIFFINS HE LOOKED RATHER SLY WHEN I MENTIONED
MISS SKIFFINS AND STOPPED IN THE STREET TO BLOW HIS NOSE WITH A ROLL
OF THE HEAD AND A FLOURISH NOT QUITE FREE FROM LATENT BOASTFULNESS

WEMMICK SAID I DO YOU REMEMBER TELLING ME BEFORE I FIRST WENT TO
MR JAGGERSS PRIVATE HOUSE TO NOTICE THAT HOUSEKEEPER

DID I HE REPLIED AH I DARE SAY I DID DEUCE TAKE ME HE ADDED
SUDDENLY I KNOW I DID I FIND I AM NOT QUITE UNSCREWED YET

A WILD BEAST TAMED YOU CALLED HER

AND WHAT DO YOU CALL HER

THE SAME HOW DID MR JAGGERS TAME HER WEMMICK

THATS HIS SECRET SHE HAS BEEN WITH HIM MANY A LONG YEAR

I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME HER STORY I FEEL A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN
BEING ACQUAINTED WITH IT YOU KNOW THAT WHAT IS SAID BETWEEN YOU AND ME
GOES NO FURTHER

WELL WEMMICK REPLIED I DONT KNOW HER STORYTHAT IS I DONT KNOW
ALL OF IT BUT WHAT I DO KNOW ILL TELL YOU WE ARE IN OUR PRIVATE AND
PERSONAL CAPACITIES OF COURSE

OF COURSE

A SCORE OR SO OF YEARS AGO THAT WOMAN WAS TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY FOR
MURDER AND WAS ACQUITTED SHE WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN AND I
BELIEVE HAD SOME GYPSY BLOOD IN HER ANYHOW IT WAS HOT ENOUGH WHEN IT
WAS UP AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE

BUT SHE WAS ACQUITTED

MR JAGGERS WAS FOR HER PURSUED WEMMICK WITH A LOOK FULL OF
MEANING AND WORKED THE CASE IN A WAY QUITE ASTONISHING IT WAS A
DESPERATE CASE AND IT WAS COMPARATIVELY EARLY DAYS WITH HIM THEN AND
HE WORKED IT TO GENERAL ADMIRATION IN FACT IT MAY ALMOST BE SAID TO
HAVE MADE HIM HE WORKED IT HIMSELF AT THE POLICEOFFICE DAY AFTER DAY
FOR MANY DAYS CONTENDING AGAINST EVEN A COMMITTAL AND AT THE TRIAL
WHERE HE COULDNT WORK IT HIMSELF SAT UNDER COUNSEL ANDEVERY ONE
KNEWPUT IN ALL THE SALT AND PEPPER THE MURDERED PERSON WAS A WOMANA
WOMAN A GOOD TEN YEARS OLDER VERY MUCH LARGER AND VERY MUCH STRONGER
IT WAS A CASE OF JEALOUSY THEY BOTH LED TRAMPING LIVES AND THIS WOMAN
IN GERRARD STREET HERE HAD BEEN MARRIED VERY YOUNG OVER THE BROOMSTICK
AS WE SAY TO A TRAMPING MAN AND WAS A PERFECT FURY IN POINT OF
JEALOUSY THE MURDERED WOMANMORE A MATCH FOR THE MAN CERTAINLY IN
POINT OF YEARSWAS FOUND DEAD IN A BARN NEAR HOUNSLOW HEATH THERE HAD
BEEN A VIOLENT STRUGGLE PERHAPS A FIGHT SHE WAS BRUISED AND SCRATCHED
AND TORN AND HAD BEEN HELD BY THE THROAT AT LAST AND CHOKED NOW
THERE WAS NO REASONABLE EVIDENCE TO IMPLICATE ANY PERSON BUT THIS
WOMAN AND ON THE IMPROBABILITIES OF HER HAVING BEEN ABLE TO DO IT MR
JAGGERS PRINCIPALLY RESTED HIS CASE YOU MAY BE SURE SAID WEMMICK
TOUCHING ME ON THE SLEEVE THAT HE NEVER DWELT UPON THE STRENGTH OF
HER HANDS THEN THOUGH HE SOMETIMES DOES NOW

I HAD TOLD WEMMICK OF HIS SHOWING US HER WRISTS THAT DAY OF THE DINNER
PARTY

WELL SIR WEMMICK WENT ON IT HAPPENEDHAPPENED DONT YOU
SEETHAT THIS WOMAN WAS SO VERY ARTFULLY DRESSED FROM THE TIME OF HER
APPREHENSION THAT SHE LOOKED MUCH SLIGHTER THAN SHE REALLY WAS IN
PARTICULAR HER SLEEVES ARE ALWAYS REMEMBERED TO HAVE BEEN SO SKILFULLY
CONTRIVED THAT HER ARMS HAD QUITE A DELICATE LOOK SHE HAD ONLY A
BRUISE OR TWO ABOUT HERNOTHING FOR A TRAMPBUT THE BACKS OF HER
HANDS WERE LACERATED AND THE QUESTION WAS WAS IT WITH FINGERNAILS
NOW MR JAGGERS SHOWED THAT SHE HAD STRUGGLED THROUGH A GREAT LOT OF
BRAMBLES WHICH WERE NOT AS HIGH AS HER FACE BUT WHICH SHE COULD NOT
HAVE GOT THROUGH AND KEPT HER HANDS OUT OF AND BITS OF THOSE BRAMBLES
WERE ACTUALLY FOUND IN HER SKIN AND PUT IN EVIDENCE AS WELL AS THE
FACT THAT THE BRAMBLES IN QUESTION WERE FOUND ON EXAMINATION TO HAVE
BEEN BROKEN THROUGH AND TO HAVE LITTLE SHREDS OF HER DRESS AND LITTLE
SPOTS OF BLOOD UPON THEM HERE AND THERE BUT THE BOLDEST POINT HE MADE
WAS THIS IT WAS ATTEMPTED TO BE SET UP IN PROOF OF HER JEALOUSY THAT
SHE WAS UNDER STRONG SUSPICION OF HAVING AT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE
MURDER FRANTICALLY DESTROYED HER CHILD BY THIS MANSOME THREE YEARS
OLDTO REVENGE HERSELF UPON HIM MR JAGGERS WORKED THAT IN THIS WAY
WE SAY THESE ARE NOT MARKS OF FINGERNAILS BUT MARKS OF BRAMBLES AND
WE SHOW YOU THE BRAMBLES YOU SAY THEY ARE MARKS OF FINGERNAILS AND
YOU SET UP THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SHE DESTROYED HER CHILD YOU MUST ACCEPT
ALL CONSEQUENCES OF THAT HYPOTHESIS FOR ANYTHING WE KNOW SHE MAY HAVE
DESTROYED HER CHILD AND THE CHILD IN CLINGING TO HER MAY HAVE
SCRATCHED HER HANDS WHAT THEN YOU ARE NOT TRYING HER FOR THE MURDER
OF HER CHILD WHY DONT YOU AS TO THIS CASE IF YOU WILL HAVE
SCRATCHES WE SAY THAT FOR ANYTHING WE KNOW YOU MAY HAVE ACCOUNTED
FOR THEM ASSUMING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT YOU HAVE NOT INVENTED
THEM TO SUM UP SIR SAID WEMMICK MR JAGGERS WAS ALTOGETHER TOO
MANY FOR THE JURY AND THEY GAVE IN

HAS SHE BEEN IN HIS SERVICE EVER SINCE

YES BUT NOT ONLY THAT SAID WEMMICK SHE WENT INTO HIS SERVICE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER HER ACQUITTAL TAMED AS SHE IS NOW SHE HAS SINCE
BEEN TAUGHT ONE THING AND ANOTHER IN THE WAY OF HER DUTIES BUT SHE WAS
TAMED FROM THE BEGINNING

DO YOU REMEMBER THE SEX OF THE CHILD

SAID TO HAVE BEEN A GIRL

YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO ME TONIGHT

NOTHING I GOT YOUR LETTER AND DESTROYED IT NOTHING

WE EXCHANGED A CORDIAL GOODNIGHT AND I WENT HOME WITH NEW MATTER FOR
MY THOUGHTS THOUGH WITH NO RELIEF FROM THE OLD




CHAPTER XLIX


PUTTING MISS HAVISHAMS NOTE IN MY POCKET THAT IT MIGHT SERVE AS MY
CREDENTIALS FOR SO SOON REAPPEARING AT SATIS HOUSE IN CASE HER
WAYWARDNESS SHOULD LEAD HER TO EXPRESS ANY SURPRISE AT SEEING ME I
WENT DOWN AGAIN BY THE COACH NEXT DAY BUT I ALIGHTED AT THE HALFWAY
HOUSE AND BREAKFASTED THERE AND WALKED THE REST OF THE DISTANCE FOR
I SOUGHT TO GET INTO THE TOWN QUIETLY BY THE UNFREQUENTED WAYS AND TO
LEAVE IT IN THE SAME MANNER

THE BEST LIGHT OF THE DAY WAS GONE WHEN I PASSED ALONG THE QUIET
ECHOING COURTS BEHIND THE HIGH STREET THE NOOKS OF RUIN WHERE THE OLD
MONKS HAD ONCE HAD THEIR REFECTORIES AND GARDENS AND WHERE THE STRONG
WALLS WERE NOW PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE OF HUMBLE SHEDS AND STABLES
WERE ALMOST AS SILENT AS THE OLD MONKS IN THEIR GRAVES THE CATHEDRAL
CHIMES HAD AT ONCE A SADDER AND A MORE REMOTE SOUND TO ME AS I HURRIED
ON AVOIDING OBSERVATION THAN THEY HAD EVER HAD BEFORE SO THE SWELL
OF THE OLD ORGAN WAS BORNE TO MY EARS LIKE FUNERAL MUSIC AND THE
ROOKS AS THEY HOVERED ABOUT THE GREY TOWER AND SWUNG IN THE BARE HIGH
TREES OF THE PRIORY GARDEN SEEMED TO CALL TO ME THAT THE PLACE WAS
CHANGED AND THAT ESTELLA WAS GONE OUT OF IT FOR EVER

AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHOM I HAD SEEN BEFORE AS ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO
LIVED IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY HOUSE ACROSS THE BACK COURTYARD OPENED THE
GATE THE LIGHTED CANDLE STOOD IN THE DARK PASSAGE WITHIN AS OF OLD
AND I TOOK IT UP AND ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE ALONE MISS HAVISHAM WAS
NOT IN HER OWN ROOM BUT WAS IN THE LARGER ROOM ACROSS THE LANDING
LOOKING IN AT THE DOOR AFTER KNOCKING IN VAIN I SAW HER SITTING ON
THE HEARTH IN A RAGGED CHAIR CLOSE BEFORE AND LOST IN THE
CONTEMPLATION OF THE ASHY FIRE

DOING AS I HAD OFTEN DONE I WENT IN AND STOOD TOUCHING THE OLD
CHIMNEYPIECE WHERE SHE COULD SEE ME WHEN SHE RAISED HER EYES THERE
WAS AN AIR OF UTTER LONELINESS UPON HER THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED ME TO
PITY THOUGH SHE HAD WILFULLY DONE ME A DEEPER INJURY THAN I COULD
CHARGE HER WITH AS I STOOD COMPASSIONATING HER AND THINKING HOW IN
THE PROGRESS OF TIME I TOO HAD COME TO BE A PART OF THE WRECKED
FORTUNES OF THAT HOUSE HER EYES RESTED ON ME SHE STARED AND SAID IN
A LOW VOICE IS IT REAL

IT IS I PIP MR JAGGERS GAVE ME YOUR NOTE YESTERDAY AND I HAVE LOST
NO TIME

THANK YOU THANK YOU

AS I BROUGHT ANOTHER OF THE RAGGED CHAIRS TO THE HEARTH AND SAT DOWN I
REMARKED A NEW EXPRESSION ON HER FACE AS IF SHE WERE AFRAID OF ME

I WANT SHE SAID TO PURSUE THAT SUBJECT YOU MENTIONED TO ME WHEN
YOU WERE LAST HERE AND TO SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT ALL STONE BUT
PERHAPS YOU CAN NEVER BELIEVE NOW THAT THERE IS ANYTHING HUMAN IN MY
HEART

WHEN I SAID SOME REASSURING WORDS SHE STRETCHED OUT HER TREMULOUS
RIGHT HAND AS THOUGH SHE WAS GOING TO TOUCH ME BUT SHE RECALLED IT
AGAIN BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION OR KNEW HOW TO RECEIVE IT

YOU SAID SPEAKING FOR YOUR FRIEND THAT YOU COULD TELL ME HOW TO DO
SOMETHING USEFUL AND GOOD SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE DONE IS IT
NOT

SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE DONE VERY MUCH

WHAT IS IT

I BEGAN EXPLAINING TO HER THAT SECRET HISTORY OF THE PARTNERSHIP I HAD
NOT GOT FAR INTO IT WHEN I JUDGED FROM HER LOOKS THAT SHE WAS THINKING
IN A DISCURSIVE WAY OF ME RATHER THAN OF WHAT I SAID IT SEEMED TO BE
SO FOR WHEN I STOPPED SPEAKING MANY MOMENTS PASSED BEFORE SHE SHOWED
THAT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT

DO YOU BREAK OFF SHE ASKED THEN WITH HER FORMER AIR OF BEING AFRAID
OF ME BECAUSE YOU HATE ME TOO MUCH TO BEAR TO SPEAK TO ME

NO NO I ANSWERED HOW CAN YOU THINK SO MISS HAVISHAM I STOPPED
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE NOT FOLLOWING WHAT I SAID

PERHAPS I WAS NOT SHE ANSWERED PUTTING A HAND TO HER HEAD BEGIN
AGAIN AND LET ME LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE STAY NOW TELL ME

SHE SET HER HAND UPON HER STICK IN THE RESOLUTE WAY THAT SOMETIMES WAS
HABITUAL TO HER AND LOOKED AT THE FIRE WITH A STRONG EXPRESSION OF
FORCING HERSELF TO ATTEND I WENT ON WITH MY EXPLANATION AND TOLD HER
HOW I HAD HOPED TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION OUT OF MY MEANS BUT HOW IN
THIS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT PART OF THE SUBJECT I REMINDED HER
INVOLVED MATTERS WHICH COULD FORM NO PART OF MY EXPLANATION FOR THEY
WERE THE WEIGHTY SECRETS OF ANOTHER

SO SAID SHE ASSENTING WITH HER HEAD BUT NOT LOOKING AT ME AND
HOW MUCH MONEY IS WANTING TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE

I WAS RATHER AFRAID OF STATING IT FOR IT SOUNDED A LARGE SUM NINE
HUNDRED POUNDS

IF I GIVE YOU THE MONEY FOR THIS PURPOSE WILL YOU KEEP MY SECRET AS
YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR OWN

QUITE AS FAITHFULLY

AND YOUR MIND WILL BE MORE AT REST

MUCH MORE AT REST

ARE YOU VERY UNHAPPY NOW

SHE ASKED THIS QUESTION STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME BUT IN AN
UNWONTED TONE OF SYMPATHY I COULD NOT REPLY AT THE MOMENT FOR MY
VOICE FAILED ME SHE PUT HER LEFT ARM ACROSS THE HEAD OF HER STICK AND
SOFTLY LAID HER FOREHEAD ON IT

I AM FAR FROM HAPPY MISS HAVISHAM BUT I HAVE OTHER CAUSES OF
DISQUIET THAN ANY YOU KNOW OF THEY ARE THE SECRETS I HAVE MENTIONED

AFTER A LITTLE WHILE SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND LOOKED AT THE FIRE
AGAIN

IT IS NOBLE IN YOU TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE OTHER CAUSES OF
UNHAPPINESS IS IT TRUE

TOO TRUE

CAN I ONLY SERVE YOU PIP BY SERVING YOUR FRIEND REGARDING THAT AS
DONE IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU YOURSELF

NOTHING I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THANK YOU EVEN MORE FOR THE
TONE OF THE QUESTION BUT THERE IS NOTHING

SHE PRESENTLY ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT THE BLIGHTED ROOM
FOR THE MEANS OF WRITING THERE WERE NONE THERE AND SHE TOOK FROM HER
POCKET A YELLOW SET OF IVORY TABLETS MOUNTED IN TARNISHED GOLD AND
WROTE UPON THEM WITH A PENCIL IN A CASE OF TARNISHED GOLD THAT HUNG
FROM HER NECK

YOU ARE STILL ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MR JAGGERS

QUITE I DINED WITH HIM YESTERDAY

THIS IS AN AUTHORITY TO HIM TO PAY YOU THAT MONEY TO LAY OUT AT YOUR
IRRESPONSIBLE DISCRETION FOR YOUR FRIEND I KEEP NO MONEY HERE BUT IF
YOU WOULD RATHER MR JAGGERS KNEW NOTHING OF THE MATTER I WILL SEND IT
TO YOU

THANK YOU MISS HAVISHAM I HAVE NOT THE LEAST OBJECTION TO RECEIVING
IT FROM HIM

SHE READ ME WHAT SHE HAD WRITTEN AND IT WAS DIRECT AND CLEAR AND
EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO ABSOLVE ME FROM ANY SUSPICION OF PROFITING BY THE
RECEIPT OF THE MONEY I TOOK THE TABLETS FROM HER HAND AND IT TREMBLED
AGAIN AND IT TREMBLED MORE AS SHE TOOK OFF THE CHAIN TO WHICH THE
PENCIL WAS ATTACHED AND PUT IT IN MINE ALL THIS SHE DID WITHOUT
LOOKING AT ME

MY NAME IS ON THE FIRST LEAF IF YOU CAN EVER WRITE UNDER MY NAME I
FORGIVE HER THOUGH EVER SO LONG AFTER MY BROKEN HEART IS DUST PRAY DO
IT

O MISS HAVISHAM SAID I I CAN DO IT NOW THERE HAVE BEEN SORE
MISTAKES AND MY LIFE HAS BEEN A BLIND AND THANKLESS ONE AND I WANT
FORGIVENESS AND DIRECTION FAR TOO MUCH TO BE BITTER WITH YOU

SHE TURNED HER FACE TO ME FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE SHE HAD AVERTED IT
AND TO MY AMAZEMENT I MAY EVEN ADD TO MY TERROR DROPPED ON HER KNEES
AT MY FEET WITH HER FOLDED HANDS RAISED TO ME IN THE MANNER IN WHICH
WHEN HER POOR HEART WAS YOUNG AND FRESH AND WHOLE THEY MUST OFTEN HAVE
BEEN RAISED TO HEAVEN FROM HER MOTHERS SIDE

TO SEE HER WITH HER WHITE HAIR AND HER WORN FACE KNEELING AT MY FEET
GAVE ME A SHOCK THROUGH ALL MY FRAME I ENTREATED HER TO RISE AND GOT
MY ARMS ABOUT HER TO HELP HER UP BUT SHE ONLY PRESSED THAT HAND OF
MINE WHICH WAS NEAREST TO HER GRASP AND HUNG HER HEAD OVER IT AND
WEPT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER SHED A TEAR BEFORE AND IN THE HOPE THAT
THE RELIEF MIGHT DO HER GOOD I BENT OVER HER WITHOUT SPEAKING SHE WAS
NOT KNEELING NOW BUT WAS DOWN UPON THE GROUND

O SHE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY WHAT HAVE I DONE WHAT HAVE I DONE

IF YOU MEAN MISS HAVISHAM WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO INJURE ME LET ME
ANSWER VERY LITTLE I SHOULD HAVE LOVED HER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
IS SHE MARRIED

YES

IT WAS A NEEDLESS QUESTION FOR A NEW DESOLATION IN THE DESOLATE HOUSE
HAD TOLD ME SO

WHAT HAVE I DONE WHAT HAVE I DONE SHE WRUNG HER HANDS AND CRUSHED
HER WHITE HAIR AND RETURNED TO THIS CRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT
HAVE I DONE

I KNEW NOT HOW TO ANSWER OR HOW TO COMFORT HER THAT SHE HAD DONE A
GRIEVOUS THING IN TAKING AN IMPRESSIONABLE CHILD TO MOULD INTO THE FORM
THAT HER WILD RESENTMENT SPURNED AFFECTION AND WOUNDED PRIDE FOUND
VENGEANCE IN I KNEW FULL WELL BUT THAT IN SHUTTING OUT THE LIGHT OF
DAY SHE HAD SHUT OUT INFINITELY MORE THAT IN SECLUSION SHE HAD
SECLUDED HERSELF FROM A THOUSAND NATURAL AND HEALING INFLUENCES THAT
HER MIND BROODING SOLITARY HAD GROWN DISEASED AS ALL MINDS DO AND
MUST AND WILL THAT REVERSE THE APPOINTED ORDER OF THEIR MAKER I KNEW
EQUALLY WELL AND COULD I LOOK UPON HER WITHOUT COMPASSION SEEING HER
PUNISHMENT IN THE RUIN SHE WAS IN HER PROFOUND UNFITNESS FOR THIS
EARTH ON WHICH SHE WAS PLACED IN THE VANITY OF SORROW WHICH HAD BECOME
A MASTER MANIA LIKE THE VANITY OF PENITENCE THE VANITY OF REMORSE
THE VANITY OF UNWORTHINESS AND OTHER MONSTROUS VANITIES THAT HAVE BEEN
CURSES IN THIS WORLD

UNTIL YOU SPOKE TO HER THE OTHER DAY AND UNTIL I SAW IN YOU A
LOOKINGGLASS THAT SHOWED ME WHAT I ONCE FELT MYSELF I DID NOT KNOW
WHAT I HAD DONE WHAT HAVE I DONE WHAT HAVE I DONE AND SO AGAIN
TWENTY FIFTY TIMES OVER WHAT HAD SHE DONE

MISS HAVISHAM I SAID WHEN HER CRY HAD DIED AWAY YOU MAY DISMISS
ME FROM YOUR MIND AND CONSCIENCE BUT ESTELLA IS A DIFFERENT CASE AND
IF YOU CAN EVER UNDO ANY SCRAP OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AMISS IN KEEPING A
PART OF HER RIGHT NATURE AWAY FROM HER IT WILL BE BETTER TO DO THAT
THAN TO BEMOAN THE PAST THROUGH A HUNDRED YEARS

YES YES I KNOW IT BUT PIPMY DEAR THERE WAS AN EARNEST WOMANLY
COMPASSION FOR ME IN HER NEW AFFECTION MY DEAR BELIEVE THIS WHEN
SHE FIRST CAME TO ME I MEANT TO SAVE HER FROM MISERY LIKE MY OWN AT
FIRST I MEANT NO MORE

WELL WELL SAID I I HOPE SO

BUT AS SHE GREW AND PROMISED TO BE VERY BEAUTIFUL I GRADUALLY DID
WORSE AND WITH MY PRAISES AND WITH MY JEWELS AND WITH MY TEACHINGS
AND WITH THIS FIGURE OF MYSELF ALWAYS BEFORE HER A WARNING TO BACK AND
POINT MY LESSONS I STOLE HER HEART AWAY AND PUT ICE IN ITS PLACE

BETTER I COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO HAVE LEFT HER A NATURAL HEART
EVEN TO BE BRUISED OR BROKEN

WITH THAT MISS HAVISHAM LOOKED DISTRACTEDLY AT ME FOR A WHILE AND
THEN BURST OUT AGAIN WHAT HAD SHE DONE

IF YOU KNEW ALL MY STORY SHE PLEADED YOU WOULD HAVE SOME
COMPASSION FOR ME AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ME

MISS HAVISHAM I ANSWERED AS DELICATELY AS I COULD I BELIEVE I MAY
SAY THAT I DO KNOW YOUR STORY AND HAVE KNOWN IT EVER SINCE I FIRST
LEFT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD IT HAS INSPIRED ME WITH GREAT COMMISERATION
AND I HOPE I UNDERSTAND IT AND ITS INFLUENCES DOES WHAT HAS PASSED
BETWEEN US GIVE ME ANY EXCUSE FOR ASKING YOU A QUESTION RELATIVE TO
ESTELLA NOT AS SHE IS BUT AS SHE WAS WHEN SHE FIRST CAME HERE

SHE WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND WITH HER ARMS ON THE RAGGED CHAIR AND
HER HEAD LEANING ON THEM SHE LOOKED FULL AT ME WHEN I SAID THIS AND
REPLIED GO ON

WHOSE CHILD WAS ESTELLA

SHE SHOOK HER HEAD

YOU DONT KNOW

SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AGAIN

BUT MR JAGGERS BROUGHT HER HERE OR SENT HER HERE

BROUGHT HER HERE

WILL YOU TELL ME HOW THAT CAME ABOUT

SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW WHISPER AND WITH CAUTION I HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN
THESE ROOMS A LONG TIME I DONT KNOW HOW LONG YOU KNOW WHAT TIME THE
CLOCKS KEEP HERE WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT I WANTED A LITTLE GIRL TO REAR
AND LOVE AND SAVE FROM MY FATE I HAD FIRST SEEN HIM WHEN I SENT FOR
HIM TO LAY THIS PLACE WASTE FOR ME HAVING READ OF HIM IN THE
NEWSPAPERS BEFORE I AND THE WORLD PARTED HE TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD
LOOK ABOUT HIM FOR SUCH AN ORPHAN CHILD ONE NIGHT HE BROUGHT HER HERE
ASLEEP AND I CALLED HER ESTELLA

MIGHT I ASK HER AGE THEN

TWO OR THREE SHE HERSELF KNOWS NOTHING BUT THAT SHE WAS LEFT AN
ORPHAN AND I ADOPTED HER

SO CONVINCED I WAS OF THAT WOMANS BEING HER MOTHER THAT I WANTED NO
EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH THE FACT IN MY OWN MIND BUT TO ANY MIND I
THOUGHT THE CONNECTION HERE WAS CLEAR AND STRAIGHT

WHAT MORE COULD I HOPE TO DO BY PROLONGING THE INTERVIEW I HAD
SUCCEEDED ON BEHALF OF HERBERT MISS HAVISHAM HAD TOLD ME ALL SHE KNEW
OF ESTELLA I HAD SAID AND DONE WHAT I COULD TO EASE HER MIND NO
MATTER WITH WHAT OTHER WORDS WE PARTED WE PARTED

TWILIGHT WAS CLOSING IN WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE NATURAL AIR I
CALLED TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD OPENED THE GATE WHEN I ENTERED THAT I
WOULD NOT TROUBLE HER JUST YET BUT WOULD WALK ROUND THE PLACE BEFORE
LEAVING FOR I HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE THERE AGAIN
AND I FELT THAT THE DYING LIGHT WAS SUITED TO MY LAST VIEW OF IT

BY THE WILDERNESS OF CASKS THAT I HAD WALKED ON LONG AGO AND ON WHICH
THE RAIN OF YEARS HAD FALLEN SINCE ROTTING THEM IN MANY PLACES AND
LEAVING MINIATURE SWAMPS AND POOLS OF WATER UPON THOSE THAT STOOD ON
END I MADE MY WAY TO THE RUINED GARDEN I WENT ALL ROUND IT ROUND BY
THE CORNER WHERE HERBERT AND I HAD FOUGHT OUR BATTLE ROUND BY THE
PATHS WHERE ESTELLA AND I HAD WALKED SO COLD SO LONELY SO DREARY
ALL

TAKING THE BREWERY ON MY WAY BACK I RAISED THE RUSTY LATCH OF A LITTLE
DOOR AT THE GARDEN END OF IT AND WALKED THROUGH I WAS GOING OUT AT
THE OPPOSITE DOORNOT EASY TO OPEN NOW FOR THE DAMP WOOD HAD STARTED
AND SWELLED AND THE HINGES WERE YIELDING AND THE THRESHOLD WAS
ENCUMBERED WITH A GROWTH OF FUNGUSWHEN I TURNED MY HEAD TO LOOK BACK
A CHILDISH ASSOCIATION REVIVED WITH WONDERFUL FORCE IN THE MOMENT OF
THE SLIGHT ACTION AND I FANCIED THAT I SAW MISS HAVISHAM HANGING TO
THE BEAM SO STRONG WAS THE IMPRESSION THAT I STOOD UNDER THE BEAM
SHUDDERING FROM HEAD TO FOOT BEFORE I KNEW IT WAS A FANCYTHOUGH TO BE
SURE I WAS THERE IN AN INSTANT

THE MOURNFULNESS OF THE PLACE AND TIME AND THE GREAT TERROR OF THIS
ILLUSION THOUGH IT WAS BUT MOMENTARY CAUSED ME TO FEEL AN
INDESCRIBABLE AWE AS I CAME OUT BETWEEN THE OPEN WOODEN GATES WHERE I
HAD ONCE WRUNG MY HAIR AFTER ESTELLA HAD WRUNG MY HEART PASSING ON
INTO THE FRONT COURTYARD I HESITATED WHETHER TO CALL THE WOMAN TO LET
ME OUT AT THE LOCKED GATE OF WHICH SHE HAD THE KEY OR FIRST TO GO
UPSTAIRS AND ASSURE MYSELF THAT MISS HAVISHAM WAS AS SAFE AND WELL AS I
HAD LEFT HER I TOOK THE LATTER COURSE AND WENT UP

I LOOKED INTO THE ROOM WHERE I HAD LEFT HER AND I SAW HER SEATED IN
THE RAGGED CHAIR UPON THE HEARTH CLOSE TO THE FIRE WITH HER BACK
TOWARDS ME IN THE MOMENT WHEN I WAS WITHDRAWING MY HEAD TO GO QUIETLY
AWAY I SAW A GREAT FLAMING LIGHT SPRING UP IN THE SAME MOMENT I SAW
HER RUNNING AT ME SHRIEKING WITH A WHIRL OF FIRE BLAZING ALL ABOUT
HER AND SOARING AT LEAST AS MANY FEET ABOVE HER HEAD AS SHE WAS HIGH

I HAD A DOUBLECAPED GREATCOAT ON AND OVER MY ARM ANOTHER THICK COAT
THAT I GOT THEM OFF CLOSED WITH HER THREW HER DOWN AND GOT THEM OVER
HER THAT I DRAGGED THE GREAT CLOTH FROM THE TABLE FOR THE SAME
PURPOSE AND WITH IT DRAGGED DOWN THE HEAP OF ROTTENNESS IN THE MIDST
AND ALL THE UGLY THINGS THAT SHELTERED THERE THAT WE WERE ON THE
GROUND STRUGGLING LIKE DESPERATE ENEMIES AND THAT THE CLOSER I COVERED
HER THE MORE WILDLY SHE SHRIEKED AND TRIED TO FREE HERSELFTHAT THIS
OCCURRED I KNEW THROUGH THE RESULT BUT NOT THROUGH ANYTHING I FELT OR
THOUGHT OR KNEW I DID I KNEW NOTHING UNTIL I KNEW THAT WE WERE ON THE
FLOOR BY THE GREAT TABLE AND THAT PATCHES OF TINDER YET ALIGHT WERE
FLOATING IN THE SMOKY AIR WHICH A MOMENT AGO HAD BEEN HER FADED
BRIDAL DRESS

THEN I LOOKED ROUND AND SAW THE DISTURBED BEETLES AND SPIDERS RUNNING
AWAY OVER THE FLOOR AND THE SERVANTS COMING IN WITH BREATHLESS CRIES
AT THE DOOR I STILL HELD HER FORCIBLY DOWN WITH ALL MY STRENGTH LIKE
A PRISONER WHO MIGHT ESCAPE AND I DOUBT IF I EVEN KNEW WHO SHE WAS OR
WHY WE HAD STRUGGLED OR THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN FLAMES OR THAT THE
FLAMES WERE OUT UNTIL I SAW THE PATCHES OF TINDER THAT HAD BEEN HER
GARMENTS NO LONGER ALIGHT BUT FALLING IN A BLACK SHOWER AROUND US

SHE WAS INSENSIBLE AND I WAS AFRAID TO HAVE HER MOVED OR EVEN
TOUCHED ASSISTANCE WAS SENT FOR AND I HELD HER UNTIL IT CAME AS IF I
UNREASONABLY FANCIED I THINK I DID THAT IF I LET HER GO THE FIRE
WOULD BREAK OUT AGAIN AND CONSUME HER WHEN I GOT UP ON THE SURGEONS
COMING TO HER WITH OTHER AID I WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE THAT BOTH MY
HANDS WERE BURNT FOR I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT THROUGH THE SENSE OF
FEELING

ON EXAMINATION IT WAS PRONOUNCED THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SERIOUS HURTS
BUT THAT THEY OF THEMSELVES WERE FAR FROM HOPELESS THE DANGER LAY
MAINLY IN THE NERVOUS SHOCK BY THE SURGEONS DIRECTIONS HER BED WAS
CARRIED INTO THAT ROOM AND LAID UPON THE GREAT TABLE WHICH HAPPENED TO
BE WELL SUITED TO THE DRESSING OF HER INJURIES WHEN I SAW HER AGAIN
AN HOUR AFTERWARDS SHE LAY INDEED WHERE I HAD SEEN HER STRIKE HER
STICK AND HAD HEARD HER SAY THAT SHE WOULD LIE ONE DAY

THOUGH EVERY VESTIGE OF HER DRESS WAS BURNT AS THEY TOLD ME SHE STILL
HAD SOMETHING OF HER OLD GHASTLY BRIDAL APPEARANCE FOR THEY HAD
COVERED HER TO THE THROAT WITH WHITE COTTONWOOL AND AS SHE LAY WITH A
WHITE SHEET LOOSELY OVERLYING THAT THE PHANTOM AIR OF SOMETHING THAT
HAD BEEN AND WAS CHANGED WAS STILL UPON HER

I FOUND ON QUESTIONING THE SERVANTS THAT ESTELLA WAS IN PARIS AND I
GOT A PROMISE FROM THE SURGEON THAT HE WOULD WRITE TO HER BY THE NEXT
POST MISS HAVISHAMS FAMILY I TOOK UPON MYSELF INTENDING TO
COMMUNICATE WITH MR MATTHEW POCKET ONLY AND LEAVE HIM TO DO AS HE
LIKED ABOUT INFORMING THE REST THIS I DID NEXT DAY THROUGH HERBERT
AS SOON AS I RETURNED TO TOWN

THERE WAS A STAGE THAT EVENING WHEN SHE SPOKE COLLECTEDLY OF WHAT HAD
HAPPENED THOUGH WITH A CERTAIN TERRIBLE VIVACITY TOWARDS MIDNIGHT SHE
BEGAN TO WANDER IN HER SPEECH AND AFTER THAT IT GRADUALLY SET IN THAT
SHE SAID INNUMERABLE TIMES IN A LOW SOLEMN VOICE WHAT HAVE I DONE
AND THEN WHEN SHE FIRST CAME I MEANT TO SAVE HER FROM MISERY LIKE
MINE AND THEN TAKE THE PENCIL AND WRITE UNDER MY NAME I FORGIVE
HER SHE NEVER CHANGED THE ORDER OF THESE THREE SENTENCES BUT SHE
SOMETIMES LEFT OUT A WORD IN ONE OR OTHER OF THEM NEVER PUTTING IN
ANOTHER WORD BUT ALWAYS LEAVING A BLANK AND GOING ON TO THE NEXT WORD

AS I COULD DO NO SERVICE THERE AND AS I HAD NEARER HOME THAT
PRESSING REASON FOR ANXIETY AND FEAR WHICH EVEN HER WANDERINGS COULD
NOT DRIVE OUT OF MY MIND I DECIDED IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THAT I
WOULD RETURN BY THE EARLY MORNING COACH WALKING ON A MILE OR SO AND
BEING TAKEN UP CLEAR OF THE TOWN AT ABOUT SIX OCLOCK OF THE MORNING
THEREFORE I LEANED OVER HER AND TOUCHED HER LIPS WITH MINE JUST AS
THEY SAID NOT STOPPING FOR BEING TOUCHED TAKE THE PENCIL AND WRITE
UNDER MY NAME I FORGIVE HER




CHAPTER L


MY HANDS HAD BEEN DRESSED TWICE OR THRICE IN THE NIGHT AND AGAIN IN
THE MORNING MY LEFT ARM WAS A GOOD DEAL BURNED TO THE ELBOW AND LESS
SEVERELY AS HIGH AS THE SHOULDER IT WAS VERY PAINFUL BUT THE FLAMES
HAD SET IN THAT DIRECTION AND I FELT THANKFUL IT WAS NO WORSE MY
RIGHT HAND WAS NOT SO BADLY BURNT BUT THAT I COULD MOVE THE FINGERS IT
WAS BANDAGED OF COURSE BUT MUCH LESS INCONVENIENTLY THAN MY LEFT HAND
AND ARM THOSE I CARRIED IN A SLING AND I COULD ONLY WEAR MY COAT LIKE
A CLOAK LOOSE OVER MY SHOULDERS AND FASTENED AT THE NECK MY HAIR HAD
BEEN CAUGHT BY THE FIRE BUT NOT MY HEAD OR FACE

WHEN HERBERT HAD BEEN DOWN TO HAMMERSMITH AND SEEN HIS FATHER HE CAME
BACK TO ME AT OUR CHAMBERS AND DEVOTED THE DAY TO ATTENDING ON ME HE
WAS THE KINDEST OF NURSES AND AT STATED TIMES TOOK OFF THE BANDAGES
AND STEEPED THEM IN THE COOLING LIQUID THAT WAS KEPT READY AND PUT
THEM ON AGAIN WITH A PATIENT TENDERNESS THAT I WAS DEEPLY GRATEFUL
FOR

AT FIRST AS I LAY QUIET ON THE SOFA I FOUND IT PAINFULLY DIFFICULT I
MIGHT SAY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF THE IMPRESSION OF THE GLARE OF THE
FLAMES THEIR HURRY AND NOISE AND THE FIERCE BURNING SMELL IF I DOZED
FOR A MINUTE I WAS AWAKENED BY MISS HAVISHAMS CRIES AND BY HER
RUNNING AT ME WITH ALL THAT HEIGHT OF FIRE ABOVE HER HEAD THIS PAIN OF
THE MIND WAS MUCH HARDER TO STRIVE AGAINST THAN ANY BODILY PAIN I
SUFFERED AND HERBERT SEEING THAT DID HIS UTMOST TO HOLD MY ATTENTION
ENGAGED

NEITHER OF US SPOKE OF THE BOAT BUT WE BOTH THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAS
MADE APPARENT BY OUR AVOIDANCE OF THE SUBJECT AND BY OUR
AGREEINGWITHOUT AGREEMENTTO MAKE MY RECOVERY OF THE USE OF MY HANDS A
QUESTION OF SO MANY HOURS NOT OF SO MANY WEEKS

MY FIRST QUESTION WHEN I SAW HERBERT HAD BEEN OF COURSE WHETHER ALL
WAS WELL DOWN THE RIVER AS HE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WITH PERFECT
CONFIDENCE AND CHEERFULNESS WE DID NOT RESUME THE SUBJECT UNTIL THE
DAY WAS WEARING AWAY BUT THEN AS HERBERT CHANGED THE BANDAGES MORE
BY THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THAN BY THE OUTER LIGHT HE WENT BACK TO IT
SPONTANEOUSLY

I SAT WITH PROVIS LAST NIGHT HANDEL TWO GOOD HOURS

WHERE WAS CLARA

DEAR LITTLE THING SAID HERBERT SHE WAS UP AND DOWN WITH
GRUFFANDGRIM ALL THE EVENING HE WAS PERPETUALLY PEGGING AT THE FLOOR
THE MOMENT SHE LEFT HIS SIGHT I DOUBT IF HE CAN HOLD OUT LONG THOUGH
WHAT WITH RUM AND PEPPERAND PEPPER AND RUMI SHOULD THINK HIS
PEGGING MUST BE NEARLY OVER

AND THEN YOU WILL BE MARRIED HERBERT

HOW CAN I TAKE CARE OF THE DEAR CHILD OTHERWISELAY YOUR ARM OUT UPON
THE BACK OF THE SOFA MY DEAR BOY AND ILL SIT DOWN HERE AND GET THE
BANDAGE OFF SO GRADUALLY THAT YOU SHALL NOT KNOW WHEN IT COMES I WAS
SPEAKING OF PROVIS DO YOU KNOW HANDEL HE IMPROVES

I SAID TO YOU I THOUGHT HE WAS SOFTENED WHEN I LAST SAW HIM

SO YOU DID AND SO HE IS HE WAS VERY COMMUNICATIVE LAST NIGHT AND
TOLD ME MORE OF HIS LIFE YOU REMEMBER HIS BREAKING OFF HERE ABOUT SOME
WOMAN THAT HE HAD HAD GREAT TROUBLE WITHDID I HURT YOU

I HAD STARTED BUT NOT UNDER HIS TOUCH HIS WORDS HAD GIVEN ME A START

I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HERBERT BUT I REMEMBER IT NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT

WELL HE WENT INTO THAT PART OF HIS LIFE AND A DARK WILD PART IT IS
SHALL I TELL YOU OR WOULD IT WORRY YOU JUST NOW

TELL ME BY ALL MEANS EVERY WORD

HERBERT BENT FORWARD TO LOOK AT ME MORE NEARLY AS IF MY REPLY HAD BEEN
RATHER MORE HURRIED OR MORE EAGER THAN HE COULD QUITE ACCOUNT FOR
YOUR HEAD IS COOL HE SAID TOUCHING IT

QUITE SAID I TELL ME WHAT PROVIS SAID MY DEAR HERBERT

IT SEEMS SAID HERBERT THERES A BANDAGE OFF MOST CHARMINGLY AND
NOW COMES THE COOL ONEMAKES YOU SHRINK AT FIRST MY POOR DEAR FELLOW
DONT IT BUT IT WILL BE COMFORTABLE PRESENTLYIT SEEMS THAT THE WOMAN
WAS A YOUNG WOMAN AND A JEALOUS WOMAN AND A REVENGEFUL WOMAN
REVENGEFUL HANDEL TO THE LAST DEGREE

TO WHAT LAST DEGREE

MURDERDOES IT STRIKE TOO COLD ON THAT SENSITIVE PLACE

I DONT FEEL IT HOW DID SHE MURDER WHOM DID SHE MURDER

WHY THE DEED MAY NOT HAVE MERITED QUITE SO TERRIBLE A NAME SAID
HERBERT BUT SHE WAS TRIED FOR IT AND MR JAGGERS DEFENDED HER AND
THE REPUTATION OF THAT DEFENCE FIRST MADE HIS NAME KNOWN TO PROVIS IT
WAS ANOTHER AND A STRONGER WOMAN WHO WAS THE VICTIM AND THERE HAD BEEN
A STRUGGLEIN A BARN WHO BEGAN IT OR HOW FAIR IT WAS OR HOW UNFAIR
MAY BE DOUBTFUL BUT HOW IT ENDED IS CERTAINLY NOT DOUBTFUL FOR THE
VICTIM WAS FOUND THROTTLED

WAS THE WOMAN BROUGHT IN GUILTY

NO SHE WAS ACQUITTEDMY POOR HANDEL I HURT YOU

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE GENTLER HERBERT YES WHAT ELSE

THIS ACQUITTED YOUNG WOMAN AND PROVIS HAD A LITTLE CHILD A LITTLE
CHILD OF WHOM PROVIS WAS EXCEEDINGLY FOND ON THE EVENING OF THE VERY
NIGHT WHEN THE OBJECT OF HER JEALOUSY WAS STRANGLED AS I TELL YOU THE
YOUNG WOMAN PRESENTED HERSELF BEFORE PROVIS FOR ONE MOMENT AND SWORE
THAT SHE WOULD DESTROY THE CHILD WHICH WAS IN HER POSSESSION AND HE
SHOULD NEVER SEE IT AGAIN THEN SHE VANISHEDTHERES THE WORST ARM
COMFORTABLY IN THE SLING ONCE MORE AND NOW THERE REMAINS BUT THE RIGHT
HAND WHICH IS A FAR EASIER JOB I CAN DO IT BETTER BY THIS LIGHT THAN
BY A STRONGER FOR MY HAND IS STEADIEST WHEN I DONT SEE THE POOR
BLISTERED PATCHES TOO DISTINCTLYYOU DONT THINK YOUR BREATHING IS
AFFECTED MY DEAR BOY YOU SEEM TO BREATHE QUICKLY

PERHAPS I DO HERBERT DID THE WOMAN KEEP HER OATH

THERE COMES THE DARKEST PART OF PROVISS LIFE SHE DID

THAT IS HE SAYS SHE DID

WHY OF COURSE MY DEAR BOY RETURNED HERBERT IN A TONE OF SURPRISE
AND AGAIN BENDING FORWARD TO GET A NEARER LOOK AT ME HE SAYS IT ALL
I HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION

NO TO BE SURE

NOW WHETHER PURSUED HERBERT HE HAD USED THE CHILDS MOTHER ILL
OR WHETHER HE HAD USED THE CHILDS MOTHER WELL PROVIS DOESNT SAY BUT
SHE HAD SHARED SOME FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF THE WRETCHED LIFE HE
DESCRIBED TO US AT THIS FIRESIDE AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE FELT PITY FOR
HER AND FORBEARANCE TOWARDS HER THEREFORE FEARING HE SHOULD BE
CALLED UPON TO DEPOSE ABOUT THIS DESTROYED CHILD AND SO BE THE CAUSE
OF HER DEATH HE HID HIMSELF MUCH AS HE GRIEVED FOR THE CHILD KEPT
HIMSELF DARK AS HE SAYS OUT OF THE WAY AND OUT OF THE TRIAL AND WAS
ONLY VAGUELY TALKED OF AS A CERTAIN MAN CALLED ABEL OUT OF WHOM THE
JEALOUSY AROSE AFTER THE ACQUITTAL SHE DISAPPEARED AND THUS HE LOST
THE CHILD AND THE CHILDS MOTHER

I WANT TO ASK

A MOMENT MY DEAR BOY AND I HAVE DONE THAT EVIL GENIUS COMPEYSON
THE WORST OF SCOUNDRELS AMONG MANY SCOUNDRELS KNOWING OF HIS KEEPING
OUT OF THE WAY AT THAT TIME AND OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING SO OF COURSE
AFTERWARDS HELD THE KNOWLEDGE OVER HIS HEAD AS A MEANS OF KEEPING HIM
POORER AND WORKING HIM HARDER IT WAS CLEAR LAST NIGHT THAT THIS BARBED
THE POINT OF PROVISS ANIMOSITY

I WANT TO KNOW SAID I AND PARTICULARLY HERBERT WHETHER HE TOLD
YOU WHEN THIS HAPPENED

PARTICULARLY LET ME REMEMBER THEN WHAT HE SAID AS TO THAT HIS
EXPRESSION WAS A ROUND SCORE O YEAR AGO AND AMOST DIRECTLY AFTER I
TOOK UP WI COMPEYSON HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME UPON HIM IN THE
LITTLE CHURCHYARD

I THINK IN MY SEVENTH YEAR

AY IT HAD HAPPENED SOME THREE OR FOUR YEARS THEN HE SAID AND YOU
BROUGHT INTO HIS MIND THE LITTLE GIRL SO TRAGICALLY LOST WHO WOULD
HAVE BEEN ABOUT YOUR AGE

HERBERT SAID I AFTER A SHORT SILENCE IN A HURRIED WAY CAN YOU
SEE ME BEST BY THE LIGHT OF THE WINDOW OR THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE

BY THE FIRELIGHT ANSWERED HERBERT COMING CLOSE AGAIN

LOOK AT ME

I DO LOOK AT YOU MY DEAR BOY

TOUCH ME

I DO TOUCH YOU MY DEAR BOY

YOU ARE NOT AFRAID THAT I AM IN ANY FEVER OR THAT MY HEAD IS MUCH
DISORDERED BY THE ACCIDENT OF LAST NIGHT

NNO MY DEAR BOY SAID HERBERT AFTER TAKING TIME TO EXAMINE ME
YOU ARE RATHER EXCITED BUT YOU ARE QUITE YOURSELF

I KNOW I AM QUITE MYSELF AND THE MAN WE HAVE IN HIDING DOWN THE
RIVER IS ESTELLAS FATHER




CHAPTER LI


WHAT PURPOSE I HAD IN VIEW WHEN I WAS HOT ON TRACING OUT AND PROVING
ESTELLAS PARENTAGE I CANNOT SAY IT WILL PRESENTLY BE SEEN THAT THE
QUESTION WAS NOT BEFORE ME IN A DISTINCT SHAPE UNTIL IT WAS PUT BEFORE
ME BY A WISER HEAD THAN MY OWN

BUT WHEN HERBERT AND I HAD HELD OUR MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION I WAS
SEIZED WITH A FEVERISH CONVICTION THAT I OUGHT TO HUNT THE MATTER
DOWNTHAT I OUGHT NOT TO LET IT REST BUT THAT I OUGHT TO SEE MR
JAGGERS AND COME AT THE BARE TRUTH I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I
FELT THAT I DID THIS FOR ESTELLAS SAKE OR WHETHER I WAS GLAD TO
TRANSFER TO THE MAN IN WHOSE PRESERVATION I WAS SO MUCH CONCERNED SOME
RAYS OF THE ROMANTIC INTEREST THAT HAD SO LONG SURROUNDED ME PERHAPS
THE LATTER POSSIBILITY MAY BE THE NEARER TO THE TRUTH

ANY WAY I COULD SCARCELY BE WITHHELD FROM GOING OUT TO GERRARD STREET
THAT NIGHT HERBERTS REPRESENTATIONS THAT IF I DID I SHOULD PROBABLY
BE LAID UP AND STRICKEN USELESS WHEN OUR FUGITIVES SAFETY WOULD
DEPEND UPON ME ALONE RESTRAINED MY IMPATIENCE ON THE UNDERSTANDING
AGAIN AND AGAIN REITERATED THAT COME WHAT WOULD I WAS TO GO TO MR
JAGGERS TOMORROW I AT LENGTH SUBMITTED TO KEEP QUIET AND TO HAVE MY
HURTS LOOKED AFTER AND TO STAY AT HOME EARLY NEXT MORNING WE WENT OUT
TOGETHER AND AT THE CORNER OF GILTSPUR STREET BY SMITHFIELD I LEFT
HERBERT TO GO HIS WAY INTO THE CITY AND TOOK MY WAY TO LITTLE BRITAIN

THERE WERE PERIODICAL OCCASIONS WHEN MR JAGGERS AND WEMMICK WENT OVER
THE OFFICE ACCOUNTS AND CHECKED OFF THE VOUCHERS AND PUT ALL THINGS
STRAIGHT ON THESE OCCASIONS WEMMICK TOOK HIS BOOKS AND PAPERS INTO
MR JAGGERSS ROOM AND ONE OF THE UPSTAIRS CLERKS CAME DOWN INTO THE
OUTER OFFICE FINDING SUCH CLERK ON WEMMICKS POST THAT MORNING I KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT I WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE MR JAGGERS AND WEMMICK
TOGETHER AS WEMMICK WOULD THEN HEAR FOR HIMSELF THAT I SAID NOTHING TO
COMPROMISE HIM

MY APPEARANCE WITH MY ARM BANDAGED AND MY COAT LOOSE OVER MY
SHOULDERS FAVOURED MY OBJECT ALTHOUGH I HAD SENT MR JAGGERS A BRIEF
ACCOUNT OF THE ACCIDENT AS SOON AS I HAD ARRIVED IN TOWN YET I HAD TO
GIVE HIM ALL THE DETAILS NOW AND THE SPECIALITY OF THE OCCASION CAUSED
OUR TALK TO BE LESS DRY AND HARD AND LESS STRICTLY REGULATED BY THE
RULES OF EVIDENCE THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE WHILE I DESCRIBED THE
DISASTER MR JAGGERS STOOD ACCORDING TO HIS WONT BEFORE THE FIRE
WEMMICK LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR STARING AT ME WITH HIS HANDS IN THE
POCKETS OF HIS TROUSERS AND HIS PEN PUT HORIZONTALLY INTO THE POST
THE TWO BRUTAL CASTS ALWAYS INSEPARABLE IN MY MIND FROM THE OFFICIAL
PROCEEDINGS SEEMED TO BE CONGESTIVELY CONSIDERING WHETHER THEY DIDNT
SMELL FIRE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT

MY NARRATIVE FINISHED AND THEIR QUESTIONS EXHAUSTED I THEN PRODUCED
MISS HAVISHAMS AUTHORITY TO RECEIVE THE NINE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR
HERBERT MR JAGGERSS EYES RETIRED A LITTLE DEEPER INTO HIS HEAD WHEN
I HANDED HIM THE TABLETS BUT HE PRESENTLY HANDED THEM OVER TO WEMMICK
WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DRAW THE CHECK FOR HIS SIGNATURE WHILE THAT WAS
IN COURSE OF BEING DONE I LOOKED ON AT WEMMICK AS HE WROTE AND MR
JAGGERS POISING AND SWAYING HIMSELF ON HIS WELLPOLISHED BOOTS LOOKED
ON AT ME I AM SORRY PIP SAID HE AS I PUT THE CHECK IN MY POCKET
WHEN HE HAD SIGNED IT THAT WE DO NOTHING FOR YOU

MISS HAVISHAM WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO ASK ME I RETURNED WHETHER SHE
COULD DO NOTHING FOR ME AND I TOLD HER NO

EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW HIS OWN BUSINESS SAID MR JAGGERS AND I SAW
WEMMICKS LIPS FORM THE WORDS PORTABLE PROPERTY

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HER NO IF I HAD BEEN YOU SAID MR JAGGERS
BUT EVERY MAN OUGHT TO KNOW HIS OWN BUSINESS BEST

EVERY MANS BUSINESS SAID WEMMICK RATHER REPROACHFULLY TOWARDS ME
IS PORTABLE PROPERTY

AS I THOUGHT THE TIME WAS NOW COME FOR PURSUING THE THEME I HAD AT
HEART I SAID TURNING ON MR JAGGERS

I DID ASK SOMETHING OF MISS HAVISHAM HOWEVER SIR I ASKED HER TO
GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION RELATIVE TO HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER AND SHE GAVE
ME ALL SHE POSSESSED

DID SHE SAID MR JAGGERS BENDING FORWARD TO LOOK AT HIS BOOTS AND
THEN STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF HAH I DONT THINK I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO
IF I HAD BEEN MISS HAVISHAM BUT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HER OWN BUSINESS
BEST

I KNOW MORE OF THE HISTORY OF MISS HAVISHAMS ADOPTED CHILD THAN MISS
HAVISHAM HERSELF DOES SIR I KNOW HER MOTHER

MR JAGGERS LOOKED AT ME INQUIRINGLY AND REPEATED MOTHER

I HAVE SEEN HER MOTHER WITHIN THESE THREE DAYS

YES SAID MR JAGGERS

AND SO HAVE YOU SIR AND YOU HAVE SEEN HER STILL MORE RECENTLY

YES SAID MR JAGGERS

PERHAPS I KNOW MORE OF ESTELLAS HISTORY THAN EVEN YOU DO SAID I I
KNOW HER FATHER TOO

A CERTAIN STOP THAT MR JAGGERS CAME TO IN HIS MANNERHE WAS TOO
SELFPOSSESSED TO CHANGE HIS MANNER BUT HE COULD NOT HELP ITS BEING
BROUGHT TO AN INDEFINABLY ATTENTIVE STOPASSURED ME THAT HE DID NOT
KNOW WHO HER FATHER WAS THIS I HAD STRONGLY SUSPECTED FROM PROVISS
ACCOUNT AS HERBERT HAD REPEATED IT OF HIS HAVING KEPT HIMSELF DARK
WHICH I PIECED ON TO THE FACT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS NOT MR JAGGERSS
CLIENT UNTIL SOME FOUR YEARS LATER AND WHEN HE COULD HAVE NO REASON
FOR CLAIMING HIS IDENTITY BUT I COULD NOT BE SURE OF THIS
UNCONSCIOUSNESS ON MR JAGGERSS PART BEFORE THOUGH I WAS QUITE SURE
OF IT NOW

SO YOU KNOW THE YOUNG LADYS FATHER PIP SAID MR JAGGERS

YES I REPLIED AND HIS NAME IS PROVISFROM NEW SOUTH WALES

EVEN MR JAGGERS STARTED WHEN I SAID THOSE WORDS IT WAS THE SLIGHTEST
START THAT COULD ESCAPE A MAN THE MOST CAREFULLY REPRESSED AND THE
SOONER CHECKED BUT HE DID START THOUGH HE MADE IT A PART OF THE
ACTION OF TAKING OUT HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF HOW WEMMICK RECEIVED THE
ANNOUNCEMENT I AM UNABLE TO SAY FOR I WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT HIM JUST
THEN LEST MR JAGGERSS SHARPNESS SHOULD DETECT THAT THERE HAD BEEN
SOME COMMUNICATION UNKNOWN TO HIM BETWEEN US

AND ON WHAT EVIDENCE PIP ASKED MR JAGGERS VERY COOLLY AS HE
PAUSED WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF HALF WAY TO HIS NOSE DOES PROVIS MAKE
THIS CLAIM

HE DOES NOT MAKE IT SAID I AND HAS NEVER MADE IT AND HAS NO
KNOWLEDGE OR BELIEF THAT HIS DAUGHTER IS IN EXISTENCE

FOR ONCE THE POWERFUL POCKETHANDKERCHIEF FAILED MY REPLY WAS SO
UNEXPECTED THAT MR JAGGERS PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF BACK INTO HIS POCKET
WITHOUT COMPLETING THE USUAL PERFORMANCE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND LOOKED
WITH STERN ATTENTION AT ME THOUGH WITH AN IMMOVABLE FACE

THEN I TOLD HIM ALL I KNEW AND HOW I KNEW IT WITH THE ONE RESERVATION
THAT I LEFT HIM TO INFER THAT I KNEW FROM MISS HAVISHAM WHAT I IN FACT
KNEW FROM WEMMICK I WAS VERY CAREFUL INDEED AS TO THAT NOR DID I LOOK
TOWARDS WEMMICK UNTIL I HAD FINISHED ALL I HAD TO TELL AND HAD BEEN
FOR SOME TIME SILENTLY MEETING MR JAGGERSS LOOK WHEN I DID AT LAST
TURN MY EYES IN WEMMICKS DIRECTION I FOUND THAT HE HAD UNPOSTED HIS
PEN AND WAS INTENT UPON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM

HAH SAID MR JAGGERS AT LAST AS HE MOVED TOWARDS THE PAPERS ON THE
TABLE WHAT ITEM WAS IT YOU WERE AT WEMMICK WHEN MR PIP CAME IN

BUT I COULD NOT SUBMIT TO BE THROWN OFF IN THAT WAY AND I MADE A
PASSIONATE ALMOST AN INDIGNANT APPEAL TO HIM TO BE MORE FRANK AND
MANLY WITH ME I REMINDED HIM OF THE FALSE HOPES INTO WHICH I HAD
LAPSED THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY HAD LASTED AND THE DISCOVERY I HAD
MADE AND I HINTED AT THE DANGER THAT WEIGHED UPON MY SPIRITS I
REPRESENTED MYSELF AS BEING SURELY WORTHY OF SOME LITTLE CONFIDENCE
FROM HIM IN RETURN FOR THE CONFIDENCE I HAD JUST NOW IMPARTED I SAID
THAT I DID NOT BLAME HIM OR SUSPECT HIM OR MISTRUST HIM BUT I WANTED
ASSURANCE OF THE TRUTH FROM HIM AND IF HE ASKED ME WHY I WANTED IT
AND WHY I THOUGHT I HAD ANY RIGHT TO IT I WOULD TELL HIM LITTLE AS HE
CARED FOR SUCH POOR DREAMS THAT I HAD LOVED ESTELLA DEARLY AND LONG
AND THAT ALTHOUGH I HAD LOST HER AND MUST LIVE A BEREAVED LIFE
WHATEVER CONCERNED HER WAS STILL NEARER AND DEARER TO ME THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD AND SEEING THAT MR JAGGERS STOOD QUITE STILL AND
SILENT AND APPARENTLY QUITE OBDURATE UNDER THIS APPEAL I TURNED TO
WEMMICK AND SAID WEMMICK I KNOW YOU TO BE A MAN WITH A GENTLE
HEART I HAVE SEEN YOUR PLEASANT HOME AND YOUR OLD FATHER AND ALL THE
INNOCENT CHEERFUL PLAYFUL WAYS WITH WHICH YOU REFRESH YOUR BUSINESS
LIFE AND I ENTREAT YOU TO SAY A WORD FOR ME TO MR JAGGERS AND TO
REPRESENT TO HIM THAT ALL CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED HE OUGHT TO BE
MORE OPEN WITH ME

I HAVE NEVER SEEN TWO MEN LOOK MORE ODDLY AT ONE ANOTHER THAN MR
JAGGERS AND WEMMICK DID AFTER THIS APOSTROPHE AT FIRST A MISGIVING
CROSSED ME THAT WEMMICK WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED FROM HIS
EMPLOYMENT BUT IT MELTED AS I SAW MR JAGGERS RELAX INTO SOMETHING
LIKE A SMILE AND WEMMICK BECOME BOLDER

WHATS ALL THIS SAID MR JAGGERS YOU WITH AN OLD FATHER AND YOU
WITH PLEASANT AND PLAYFUL WAYS

WELL RETURNED WEMMICK IF I DONT BRING EM HERE WHAT DOES IT
MATTER

PIP SAID MR JAGGERS LAYING HIS HAND UPON MY ARM AND SMILING
OPENLY THIS MAN MUST BE THE MOST CUNNING IMPOSTOR IN ALL LONDON

NOT A BIT OF IT RETURNED WEMMICK GROWING BOLDER AND BOLDER I
THINK YOURE ANOTHER

AGAIN THEY EXCHANGED THEIR FORMER ODD LOOKS EACH APPARENTLY STILL
DISTRUSTFUL THAT THE OTHER WAS TAKING HIM IN

YOU WITH A PLEASANT HOME SAID MR JAGGERS

SINCE IT DONT INTERFERE WITH BUSINESS RETURNED WEMMICK LET IT BE
SO NOW I LOOK AT YOU SIR I SHOULDNT WONDER IF YOU MIGHT BE
PLANNING AND CONTRIVING TO HAVE A PLEASANT HOME OF YOUR OWN ONE OF
THESE DAYS WHEN YOURE TIRED OF ALL THIS WORK

MR JAGGERS NODDED HIS HEAD RETROSPECTIVELY TWO OR THREE TIMES AND
ACTUALLY DREW A SIGH PIP SAID HE WE WONT TALK ABOUT POOR
DREAMS YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT SUCH THINGS THAN I HAVING MUCH FRESHER
EXPERIENCE OF THAT KIND BUT NOW ABOUT THIS OTHER MATTER ILL PUT A
CASE TO YOU MIND I ADMIT NOTHING

HE WAITED FOR ME TO DECLARE THAT I QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE EXPRESSLY
SAID THAT HE ADMITTED NOTHING

NOW PIP SAID MR JAGGERS PUT THIS CASE PUT THE CASE THAT A
WOMAN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED HELD HER CHILD
CONCEALED AND WAS OBLIGED TO COMMUNICATE THE FACT TO HER LEGAL
ADVISER ON HIS REPRESENTING TO HER THAT HE MUST KNOW WITH AN EYE TO
THE LATITUDE OF HIS DEFENCE HOW THE FACT STOOD ABOUT THAT CHILD PUT
THE CASE THAT AT THE SAME TIME HE HELD A TRUST TO FIND A CHILD FOR AN
ECCENTRIC RICH LADY TO ADOPT AND BRING UP

I FOLLOW YOU SIR

PUT THE CASE THAT HE LIVED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF EVIL AND THAT ALL HE
SAW OF CHILDREN WAS THEIR BEING GENERATED IN GREAT NUMBERS FOR CERTAIN
DESTRUCTION PUT THE CASE THAT HE OFTEN SAW CHILDREN SOLEMNLY TRIED AT
A CRIMINAL BAR WHERE THEY WERE HELD UP TO BE SEEN PUT THE CASE THAT
HE HABITUALLY KNEW OF THEIR BEING IMPRISONED WHIPPED TRANSPORTED
NEGLECTED CAST OUT QUALIFIED IN ALL WAYS FOR THE HANGMAN AND GROWING
UP TO BE HANGED PUT THE CASE THAT PRETTY NIGH ALL THE CHILDREN HE SAW
IN HIS DAILY BUSINESS LIFE HE HAD REASON TO LOOK UPON AS SO MUCH SPAWN
TO DEVELOP INTO THE FISH THAT WERE TO COME TO HIS NETTO BE
PROSECUTED DEFENDED FORSWORN MADE ORPHANS BEDEVILLED SOMEHOW

I FOLLOW YOU SIR

PUT THE CASE PIP THAT HERE WAS ONE PRETTY LITTLE CHILD OUT OF THE
HEAP WHO COULD BE SAVED WHOM THE FATHER BELIEVED DEAD AND DARED MAKE
NO STIR ABOUT AS TO WHOM OVER THE MOTHER THE LEGAL ADVISER HAD THIS
POWER I KNOW WHAT YOU DID AND HOW YOU DID IT YOU CAME SO AND SO
YOU DID SUCH AND SUCH THINGS TO DIVERT SUSPICION I HAVE TRACKED YOU
THROUGH IT ALL AND I TELL IT YOU ALL PART WITH THE CHILD UNLESS IT
SHOULD BE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE IT TO CLEAR YOU AND THEN IT SHALL BE
PRODUCED GIVE THE CHILD INTO MY HANDS AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO BRING
YOU OFF IF YOU ARE SAVED YOUR CHILD IS SAVED TOO IF YOU ARE LOST
YOUR CHILD IS STILL SAVED PUT THE CASE THAT THIS WAS DONE AND THAT
THE WOMAN WAS CLEARED

I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY

BUT THAT I MAKE NO ADMISSIONS

THAT YOU MAKE NO ADMISSIONS AND WEMMICK REPEATED NO ADMISSIONS

PUT THE CASE PIP THAT PASSION AND THE TERROR OF DEATH HAD A LITTLE
SHAKEN THE WOMANS INTELLECTS AND THAT WHEN SHE WAS SET AT LIBERTY
SHE WAS SCARED OUT OF THE WAYS OF THE WORLD AND WENT TO HIM TO BE
SHELTERED PUT THE CASE THAT HE TOOK HER IN AND THAT HE KEPT DOWN THE
OLD WILD VIOLENT NATURE WHENEVER HE SAW AN INKLING OF ITS BREAKING
OUT BY ASSERTING HIS POWER OVER HER IN THE OLD WAY DO YOU COMPREHEND
THE IMAGINARY CASE

QUITE

PUT THE CASE THAT THE CHILD GREW UP AND WAS MARRIED FOR MONEY THAT
THE MOTHER WAS STILL LIVING THAT THE FATHER WAS STILL LIVING THAT THE
MOTHER AND FATHER UNKNOWN TO ONE ANOTHER WERE DWELLING WITHIN SO MANY
MILES FURLONGS YARDS IF YOU LIKE OF ONE ANOTHER THAT THE SECRET WAS
STILL A SECRET EXCEPT THAT YOU HAD GOT WIND OF IT PUT THAT LAST CASE
TO YOURSELF VERY CAREFULLY

I DO

I ASK WEMMICK TO PUT IT TO HIMSELF VERY CAREFULLY

AND WEMMICK SAID I DO

FOR WHOSE SAKE WOULD YOU REVEAL THE SECRET FOR THE FATHERS I THINK
HE WOULD NOT BE MUCH THE BETTER FOR THE MOTHER FOR THE MOTHERS I
THINK IF SHE HAD DONE SUCH A DEED SHE WOULD BE SAFER WHERE SHE WAS FOR
THE DAUGHTERS I THINK IT WOULD HARDLY SERVE HER TO ESTABLISH HER
PARENTAGE FOR THE INFORMATION OF HER HUSBAND AND TO DRAG HER BACK TO
DISGRACE AFTER AN ESCAPE OF TWENTY YEARS PRETTY SECURE TO LAST FOR
LIFE BUT ADD THE CASE THAT YOU HAD LOVED HER PIP AND HAD MADE HER
THE SUBJECT OF THOSE POOR DREAMS WHICH HAVE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
BEEN IN THE HEADS OF MORE MEN THAN YOU THINK LIKELY THEN I TELL YOU
THAT YOU HAD BETTERAND WOULD MUCH SOONER WHEN YOU HAD THOUGHT WELL OF
ITCHOP OFF THAT BANDAGED LEFT HAND OF YOURS WITH YOUR BANDAGED RIGHT
HAND AND THEN PASS THE CHOPPER ON TO WEMMICK THERE TO CUT THAT OFF
TOO

I LOOKED AT WEMMICK WHOSE FACE WAS VERY GRAVE HE GRAVELY TOUCHED HIS
LIPS WITH HIS FOREFINGER I DID THE SAME MR JAGGERS DID THE SAME
NOW WEMMICK SAID THE LATTER THEN RESUMING HIS USUAL MANNER WHAT
ITEM WAS IT YOU WERE AT WHEN MR PIP CAME IN

STANDING BY FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEY WERE AT WORK I OBSERVED THAT THE
ODD LOOKS THEY HAD CAST AT ONE ANOTHER WERE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES
WITH THIS DIFFERENCE NOW THAT EACH OF THEM SEEMED SUSPICIOUS NOT TO
SAY CONSCIOUS OF HAVING SHOWN HIMSELF IN A WEAK AND UNPROFESSIONAL
LIGHT TO THE OTHER FOR THIS REASON I SUPPOSE THEY WERE NOW
INFLEXIBLE WITH ONE ANOTHER MR JAGGERS BEING HIGHLY DICTATORIAL AND
WEMMICK OBSTINATELY JUSTIFYING HIMSELF WHENEVER THERE WAS THE SMALLEST
POINT IN ABEYANCE FOR A MOMENT I HAD NEVER SEEN THEM ON SUCH ILL
TERMS FOR GENERALLY THEY GOT ON VERY WELL INDEED TOGETHER

BUT THEY WERE BOTH HAPPILY RELIEVED BY THE OPPORTUNE APPEARANCE OF
MIKE THE CLIENT WITH THE FUR CAP AND THE HABIT OF WIPING HIS NOSE ON
HIS SLEEVE WHOM I HAD SEEN ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF MY APPEARANCE
WITHIN THOSE WALLS THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO EITHER IN HIS OWN PERSON OR
IN THAT OF SOME MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS IN TROUBLE
WHICH IN THAT PLACE MEANT NEWGATE CALLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT HIS ELDEST
DAUGHTER WAS TAKEN UP ON SUSPICION OF SHOPLIFTING AS HE IMPARTED THIS
MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE TO WEMMICK MR JAGGERS STANDING MAGISTERIALLY
BEFORE THE FIRE AND TAKING NO SHARE IN THE PROCEEDINGS MIKES EYE
HAPPENED TO TWINKLE WITH A TEAR

WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT DEMANDED WEMMICK WITH THE UTMOST INDIGNATION
WHAT DO YOU COME SNIVELLING HERE FOR

I DIDNT GO TO DO IT MR WEMMICK

YOU DID SAID WEMMICK HOW DARE YOU YOURE NOT IN A FIT STATE TO
COME HERE IF YOU CANT COME HERE WITHOUT SPLUTTERING LIKE A BAD PEN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT

A MAN CANT HELP HIS FEELINGS MR WEMMICK PLEADED MIKE

HIS WHAT DEMANDED WEMMICK QUITE SAVAGELY SAY THAT AGAIN

NOW LOOK HERE MY MAN SAID MR JAGGERS ADVANCING A STEP AND
POINTING TO THE DOOR GET OUT OF THIS OFFICE ILL HAVE NO FEELINGS
HERE GET OUT

IT SERVES YOU RIGHT SAID WEMMICK GET OUT

SO THE UNFORTUNATE MIKE VERY HUMBLY WITHDREW AND MR JAGGERS AND
WEMMICK APPEARED TO HAVE REESTABLISHED THEIR GOOD UNDERSTANDING AND
WENT TO WORK AGAIN WITH AN AIR OF REFRESHMENT UPON THEM AS IF THEY HAD
JUST HAD LUNCH




CHAPTER LII


FROM LITTLE BRITAIN I WENT WITH MY CHECK IN MY POCKET TO MISS
SKIFFINSS BROTHER THE ACCOUNTANT AND MISS SKIFFINSS BROTHER THE
ACCOUNTANT GOING STRAIGHT TO CLARRIKERS AND BRINGING CLARRIKER TO ME
I HAD THE GREAT SATISFACTION OF CONCLUDING THAT ARRANGEMENT IT WAS THE
ONLY GOOD THING I HAD DONE AND THE ONLY COMPLETED THING I HAD DONE
SINCE I WAS FIRST APPRISED OF MY GREAT EXPECTATIONS

CLARRIKER INFORMING ME ON THAT OCCASION THAT THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOUSE
WERE STEADILY PROGRESSING THAT HE WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A
SMALL BRANCHHOUSE IN THE EAST WHICH WAS MUCH WANTED FOR THE EXTENSION
OF THE BUSINESS AND THAT HERBERT IN HIS NEW PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY WOULD
GO OUT AND TAKE CHARGE OF IT I FOUND THAT I MUST HAVE PREPARED FOR A
SEPARATION FROM MY FRIEND EVEN THOUGH MY OWN AFFAIRS HAD BEEN MORE
SETTLED AND NOW INDEED I FELT AS IF MY LAST ANCHOR WERE LOOSENING
ITS HOLD AND I SHOULD SOON BE DRIVING WITH THE WINDS AND WAVES

BUT THERE WAS RECOMPENSE IN THE JOY WITH WHICH HERBERT WOULD COME HOME
OF A NIGHT AND TELL ME OF THESE CHANGES LITTLE IMAGINING THAT HE TOLD
ME NO NEWS AND WOULD SKETCH AIRY PICTURES OF HIMSELF CONDUCTING CLARA
BARLEY TO THE LAND OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS AND OF ME GOING OUT TO JOIN
THEM WITH A CARAVAN OF CAMELS I BELIEVE AND OF OUR ALL GOING UP THE
NILE AND SEEING WONDERS WITHOUT BEING SANGUINE AS TO MY OWN PART IN
THOSE BRIGHT PLANS I FELT THAT HERBERTS WAY WAS CLEARING FAST AND
THAT OLD BILL BARLEY HAD BUT TO STICK TO HIS PEPPER AND RUM AND HIS
DAUGHTER WOULD SOON BE HAPPILY PROVIDED FOR

WE HAD NOW GOT INTO THE MONTH OF MARCH MY LEFT ARM THOUGH IT
PRESENTED NO BAD SYMPTOMS TOOK IN THE NATURAL COURSE SO LONG TO HEAL
THAT I WAS STILL UNABLE TO GET A COAT ON MY RIGHT ARM WAS TOLERABLY
RESTORED DISFIGURED BUT FAIRLY SERVICEABLE

ON A MONDAY MORNING WHEN HERBERT AND I WERE AT BREAKFAST I RECEIVED
THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM WEMMICK BY THE POST

WALWORTH BURN THIS AS SOON AS READ EARLY IN THE WEEK OR SAY
WEDNESDAY YOU MIGHT DO WHAT YOU KNOW OF IF YOU FELT DISPOSED TO TRY
IT NOW BURN

WHEN I HAD SHOWN THIS TO HERBERT AND HAD PUT IT IN THE FIREBUT NOT
BEFORE WE HAD BOTH GOT IT BY HEARTWE CONSIDERED WHAT TO DO FOR OF
COURSE MY BEING DISABLED COULD NOW BE NO LONGER KEPT OUT OF VIEW

I HAVE THOUGHT IT OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN SAID HERBERT AND I THINK I
KNOW A BETTER COURSE THAN TAKING A THAMES WATERMAN TAKE STARTOP A
GOOD FELLOW A SKILLED HAND FOND OF US AND ENTHUSIASTIC AND
HONOURABLE

I HAD THOUGHT OF HIM MORE THAN ONCE

BUT HOW MUCH WOULD YOU TELL HIM HERBERT

IT IS NECESSARY TO TELL HIM VERY LITTLE LET HIM SUPPOSE IT A MERE
FREAK BUT A SECRET ONE UNTIL THE MORNING COMES THEN LET HIM KNOW
THAT THERE IS URGENT REASON FOR YOUR GETTING PROVIS ABOARD AND AWAY
YOU GO WITH HIM

NO DOUBT

WHERE

IT HAD SEEMED TO ME IN THE MANY ANXIOUS CONSIDERATIONS I HAD GIVEN THE
POINT ALMOST INDIFFERENT WHAT PORT WE MADE FORHAMBURG ROTTERDAM
ANTWERPTHE PLACE SIGNIFIED LITTLE SO THAT HE WAS OUT OF ENGLAND ANY
FOREIGN STEAMER THAT FELL IN OUR WAY AND WOULD TAKE US UP WOULD DO I
HAD ALWAYS PROPOSED TO MYSELF TO GET HIM WELL DOWN THE RIVER IN THE
BOAT CERTAINLY WELL BEYOND GRAVESEND WHICH WAS A CRITICAL PLACE FOR
SEARCH OR INQUIRY IF SUSPICION WERE AFOOT AS FOREIGN STEAMERS WOULD
LEAVE LONDON AT ABOUT THE TIME OF HIGHWATER OUR PLAN WOULD BE TO GET
DOWN THE RIVER BY A PREVIOUS EBBTIDE AND LIE BY IN SOME QUIET SPOT
UNTIL WE COULD PULL OFF TO ONE THE TIME WHEN ONE WOULD BE DUE WHERE WE
LAY WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE COULD BE CALCULATED PRETTY NEARLY IF WE
MADE INQUIRIES BEFOREHAND

HERBERT ASSENTED TO ALL THIS AND WE WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER
BREAKFAST TO PURSUE OUR INVESTIGATIONS WE FOUND THAT A STEAMER FOR
HAMBURG WAS LIKELY TO SUIT OUR PURPOSE BEST AND WE DIRECTED OUR
THOUGHTS CHIEFLY TO THAT VESSEL BUT WE NOTED DOWN WHAT OTHER FOREIGN
STEAMERS WOULD LEAVE LONDON WITH THE SAME TIDE AND WE SATISFIED
OURSELVES THAT WE KNEW THE BUILD AND COLOUR OF EACH WE THEN SEPARATED
FOR A FEW HOURS I TO GET AT ONCE SUCH PASSPORTS AS WERE NECESSARY
HERBERT TO SEE STARTOP AT HIS LODGINGS WE BOTH DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO
WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE AND WHEN WE MET AGAIN AT ONE OCLOCK REPORTED IT
DONE I FOR MY PART WAS PREPARED WITH PASSPORTS HERBERT HAD SEEN
STARTOP AND HE WAS MORE THAN READY TO JOIN

THOSE TWO SHOULD PULL A PAIR OF OARS WE SETTLED AND I WOULD STEER
OUR CHARGE WOULD BE SITTER AND KEEP QUIET AS SPEED WAS NOT OUR
OBJECT WE SHOULD MAKE WAY ENOUGH WE ARRANGED THAT HERBERT SHOULD NOT
COME HOME TO DINNER BEFORE GOING TO MILL POND BANK THAT EVENING THAT
HE SHOULD NOT GO THERE AT ALL TOMORROW EVENING TUESDAY THAT HE
SHOULD PREPARE PROVIS TO COME DOWN TO SOME STAIRS HARD BY THE HOUSE ON
WEDNESDAY WHEN HE SAW US APPROACH AND NOT SOONER THAT ALL THE
ARRANGEMENTS WITH HIM SHOULD BE CONCLUDED THAT MONDAY NIGHT AND THAT
HE SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED WITH NO MORE IN ANY WAY UNTIL WE TOOK HIM ON
BOARD

THESE PRECAUTIONS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY BOTH OF US I WENT HOME

ON OPENING THE OUTER DOOR OF OUR CHAMBERS WITH MY KEY I FOUND A LETTER
IN THE BOX DIRECTED TO ME A VERY DIRTY LETTER THOUGH NOT
ILLWRITTEN IT HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY HAND OF COURSE SINCE I LEFT
HOME AND ITS CONTENTS WERE THESE

IF YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO COME TO THE OLD MARSHES TONIGHT OR TOMORROW
NIGHT AT NINE AND TO COME TO THE LITTLE SLUICEHOUSE BY THE LIMEKILN
YOU HAD BETTER COME IF YOU WANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR UNCLE
PROVIS YOU HAD MUCH BETTER COME AND TELL NO ONE AND LOSE NO TIME
YOU MUST COME ALONE BRING THIS WITH YOU

I HAD HAD LOAD ENOUGH UPON MY MIND BEFORE THE RECEIPT OF THIS STRANGE
LETTER WHAT TO DO NOW I COULD NOT TELL AND THE WORST WAS THAT I
MUST DECIDE QUICKLY OR I SHOULD MISS THE AFTERNOON COACH WHICH WOULD
TAKE ME DOWN IN TIME FOR TONIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT I COULD NOT THINK OF
GOING FOR IT WOULD BE TOO CLOSE UPON THE TIME OF THE FLIGHT AND
AGAIN FOR ANYTHING I KNEW THE PROFFERED INFORMATION MIGHT HAVE SOME
IMPORTANT BEARING ON THE FLIGHT ITSELF

IF I HAD HAD AMPLE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION I BELIEVE I SHOULD STILL
HAVE GONE HAVING HARDLY ANY TIME FOR CONSIDERATIONMY WATCH SHOWING
ME THAT THE COACH STARTED WITHIN HALF AN HOURI RESOLVED TO GO I
SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE GONE BUT FOR THE REFERENCE TO MY UNCLE
PROVIS THAT COMING ON WEMMICKS LETTER AND THE MORNINGS BUSY
PREPARATION TURNED THE SCALE

IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO BECOME CLEARLY POSSESSED OF THE CONTENTS OF
ALMOST ANY LETTER IN A VIOLENT HURRY THAT I HAD TO READ THIS
MYSTERIOUS EPISTLE AGAIN TWICE BEFORE ITS INJUNCTION TO ME TO BE
SECRET GOT MECHANICALLY INTO MY MIND YIELDING TO IT IN THE SAME
MECHANICAL KIND OF WAY I LEFT A NOTE IN PENCIL FOR HERBERT TELLING
HIM THAT AS I SHOULD BE SO SOON GOING AWAY I KNEW NOT FOR HOW LONG I
HAD DECIDED TO HURRY DOWN AND BACK TO ASCERTAIN FOR MYSELF HOW MISS
HAVISHAM WAS FARING I HAD THEN BARELY TIME TO GET MY GREATCOAT LOCK
UP THE CHAMBERS AND MAKE FOR THE COACHOFFICE BY THE SHORT BYWAYS IF
I HAD TAKEN A HACKNEYCHARIOT AND GONE BY THE STREETS I SHOULD HAVE
MISSED MY AIM GOING AS I DID I CAUGHT THE COACH JUST AS IT CAME OUT
OF THE YARD I WAS THE ONLY INSIDE PASSENGER JOLTING AWAY KNEEDEEP IN
STRAW WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF

FOR I REALLY HAD NOT BEEN MYSELF SINCE THE RECEIPT OF THE LETTER IT
HAD SO BEWILDERED ME ENSUING ON THE HURRY OF THE MORNING THE MORNING
HURRY AND FLUTTER HAD BEEN GREAT FOR LONG AND ANXIOUSLY AS I HAD
WAITED FOR WEMMICK HIS HINT HAD COME LIKE A SURPRISE AT LAST AND NOW
I BEGAN TO WONDER AT MYSELF FOR BEING IN THE COACH AND TO DOUBT
WHETHER I HAD SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BEING THERE AND TO CONSIDER
WHETHER I SHOULD GET OUT PRESENTLY AND GO BACK AND TO ARGUE AGAINST
EVER HEEDING AN ANONYMOUS COMMUNICATION AND IN SHORT TO PASS THROUGH
ALL THOSE PHASES OF CONTRADICTION AND INDECISION TO WHICH I SUPPOSE
VERY FEW HURRIED PEOPLE ARE STRANGERS STILL THE REFERENCE TO PROVIS
BY NAME MASTERED EVERYTHING I REASONED AS I HAD REASONED ALREADY
WITHOUT KNOWING ITIF THAT BE REASONINGIN CASE ANY HARM SHOULD
BEFALL HIM THROUGH MY NOT GOING HOW COULD I EVER FORGIVE MYSELF

IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE GOT DOWN AND THE JOURNEY SEEMED LONG AND DREARY
TO ME WHO COULD SEE LITTLE OF IT INSIDE AND WHO COULD NOT GO OUTSIDE
IN MY DISABLED STATE AVOIDING THE BLUE BOAR I PUT UP AT AN INN OF
MINOR REPUTATION DOWN THE TOWN AND ORDERED SOME DINNER WHILE IT WAS
PREPARING I WENT TO SATIS HOUSE AND INQUIRED FOR MISS HAVISHAM SHE
WAS STILL VERY ILL THOUGH CONSIDERED SOMETHING BETTER

MY INN HAD ONCE BEEN A PART OF AN ANCIENT ECCLESIASTICAL HOUSE AND I
DINED IN A LITTLE OCTAGONAL COMMONROOM LIKE A FONT AS I WAS NOT ABLE
TO CUT MY DINNER THE OLD LANDLORD WITH A SHINING BALD HEAD DID IT FOR
ME THIS BRINGING US INTO CONVERSATION HE WAS SO GOOD AS TO ENTERTAIN
ME WITH MY OWN STORYOF COURSE WITH THE POPULAR FEATURE THAT
PUMBLECHOOK WAS MY EARLIEST BENEFACTOR AND THE FOUNDER OF MY FORTUNES

DO YOU KNOW THE YOUNG MAN SAID I

KNOW HIM REPEATED THE LANDLORD EVER SINCE HE WASNO HEIGHT AT
ALL

DOES HE EVER COME BACK TO THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD

AY HE COMES BACK SAID THE LANDLORD TO HIS GREAT FRIENDS NOW AND
AGAIN AND GIVES THE COLD SHOULDER TO THE MAN THAT MADE HIM

WHAT MAN IS THAT

HIM THAT I SPEAK OF SAID THE LANDLORD MR PUMBLECHOOK

IS HE UNGRATEFUL TO NO ONE ELSE

NO DOUBT HE WOULD BE IF HE COULD RETURNED THE LANDLORD BUT HE
CANT AND WHY BECAUSE PUMBLECHOOK DONE EVERYTHING FOR HIM

DOES PUMBLECHOOK SAY SO

SAY SO REPLIED THE LANDLORD HE HANT NO CALL TO SAY SO

BUT DOES HE SAY SO

IT WOULD TURN A MANS BLOOD TO WHITE WINE WINEGAR TO HEAR HIM TELL OF
IT SIR SAID THE LANDLORD

I THOUGHT YET JOE DEAR JOE YOU NEVER TELL OF IT LONGSUFFERING
AND LOVING JOE YOU NEVER COMPLAIN NOR YOU SWEETTEMPERED BIDDY

YOUR APPETITES BEEN TOUCHED LIKE BY YOUR ACCIDENT SAID THE
LANDLORD GLANCING AT THE BANDAGED ARM UNDER MY COAT TRY A TENDERER
BIT

NO THANK YOU I REPLIED TURNING FROM THE TABLE TO BROOD OVER THE
FIRE I CAN EAT NO MORE PLEASE TAKE IT AWAY

I HAD NEVER BEEN STRUCK AT SO KEENLY FOR MY THANKLESSNESS TO JOE AS
THROUGH THE BRAZEN IMPOSTOR PUMBLECHOOK THE FALSER HE THE TRUER JOE
THE MEANER HE THE NOBLER JOE

MY HEART WAS DEEPLY AND MOST DESERVEDLY HUMBLED AS I MUSED OVER THE
FIRE FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THE STRIKING OF THE CLOCK AROUSED ME BUT NOT
FROM MY DEJECTION OR REMORSE AND I GOT UP AND HAD MY COAT FASTENED
ROUND MY NECK AND WENT OUT I HAD PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT IN MY POCKETS FOR
THE LETTER THAT I MIGHT REFER TO IT AGAIN BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
AND WAS UNEASY TO THINK THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN DROPPED IN THE STRAW OF
THE COACH I KNEW VERY WELL HOWEVER THAT THE APPOINTED PLACE WAS THE
LITTLE SLUICEHOUSE BY THE LIMEKILN ON THE MARSHES AND THE HOUR NINE
TOWARDS THE MARSHES I NOW WENT STRAIGHT HAVING NO TIME TO SPARE

ILLUSTRATION




CHAPTER LIII


IT WAS A DARK NIGHT THOUGH THE FULL MOON ROSE AS I LEFT THE ENCLOSED
LANDS AND PASSED OUT UPON THE MARSHES BEYOND THEIR DARK LINE THERE
WAS A RIBBON OF CLEAR SKY HARDLY BROAD ENOUGH TO HOLD THE RED LARGE
MOON IN A FEW MINUTES SHE HAD ASCENDED OUT OF THAT CLEAR FIELD IN
AMONG THE PILED MOUNTAINS OF CLOUD

THERE WAS A MELANCHOLY WIND AND THE MARSHES WERE VERY DISMAL A
STRANGER WOULD HAVE FOUND THEM INSUPPORTABLE AND EVEN TO ME THEY WERE
SO OPPRESSIVE THAT I HESITATED HALF INCLINED TO GO BACK BUT I KNEW
THEM WELL AND COULD HAVE FOUND MY WAY ON A FAR DARKER NIGHT AND HAD
NO EXCUSE FOR RETURNING BEING THERE SO HAVING COME THERE AGAINST MY
INCLINATION I WENT ON AGAINST IT

THE DIRECTION THAT I TOOK WAS NOT THAT IN WHICH MY OLD HOME LAY NOR
THAT IN WHICH WE HAD PURSUED THE CONVICTS MY BACK WAS TURNED TOWARDS
THE DISTANT HULKS AS I WALKED ON AND THOUGH I COULD SEE THE OLD
LIGHTS AWAY ON THE SPITS OF SAND I SAW THEM OVER MY SHOULDER I KNEW
THE LIMEKILN AS WELL AS I KNEW THE OLD BATTERY BUT THEY WERE MILES
APART SO THAT IF A LIGHT HAD BEEN BURNING AT EACH POINT THAT NIGHT
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG STRIP OF THE BLANK HORIZON BETWEEN THE TWO
BRIGHT SPECKS

AT FIRST I HAD TO SHUT SOME GATES AFTER ME AND NOW AND THEN TO STAND
STILL WHILE THE CATTLE THAT WERE LYING IN THE BANKEDUP PATHWAY AROSE
AND BLUNDERED DOWN AMONG THE GRASS AND REEDS BUT AFTER A LITTLE WHILE
I SEEMED TO HAVE THE WHOLE FLATS TO MYSELF

IT WAS ANOTHER HALFHOUR BEFORE I DREW NEAR TO THE KILN THE LIME WAS
BURNING WITH A SLUGGISH STIFLING SMELL BUT THE FIRES WERE MADE UP AND
LEFT AND NO WORKMEN WERE VISIBLE HARD BY WAS A SMALL STONEQUARRY IT
LAY DIRECTLY IN MY WAY AND HAD BEEN WORKED THAT DAY AS I SAW BY THE
TOOLS AND BARROWS THAT WERE LYING ABOUT

COMING UP AGAIN TO THE MARSH LEVEL OUT OF THIS EXCAVATIONFOR THE RUDE
PATH LAY THROUGH ITI SAW A LIGHT IN THE OLD SLUICEHOUSE I QUICKENED
MY PACE AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WITH MY HAND WAITING FOR SOME REPLY
I LOOKED ABOUT ME NOTICING HOW THE SLUICE WAS ABANDONED AND BROKEN
AND HOW THE HOUSEOF WOOD WITH A TILED ROOFWOULD NOT BE PROOF AGAINST
THE WEATHER MUCH LONGER IF IT WERE SO EVEN NOW AND HOW THE MUD AND
OOZE WERE COATED WITH LIME AND HOW THE CHOKING VAPOUR OF THE KILN
CREPT IN A GHOSTLY WAY TOWARDS ME STILL THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND I
KNOCKED AGAIN NO ANSWER STILL AND I TRIED THE LATCH

IT ROSE UNDER MY HAND AND THE DOOR YIELDED LOOKING IN I SAW A
LIGHTED CANDLE ON A TABLE A BENCH AND A MATTRESS ON A TRUCKLE
BEDSTEAD AS THERE WAS A LOFT ABOVE I CALLED IS THERE ANY ONE HERE
BUT NO VOICE ANSWERED THEN I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND FINDING THAT IT
WAS PAST NINE CALLED AGAIN IS THERE ANY ONE HERE THERE BEING STILL
NO ANSWER I WENT OUT AT THE DOOR IRRESOLUTE WHAT TO DO

IT WAS BEGINNING TO RAIN FAST SEEING NOTHING SAVE WHAT I HAD SEEN
ALREADY I TURNED BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND STOOD JUST WITHIN THE
SHELTER OF THE DOORWAY LOOKING OUT INTO THE NIGHT WHILE I WAS
CONSIDERING THAT SOME ONE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE LATELY AND MUST SOON BE
COMING BACK OR THE CANDLE WOULD NOT BE BURNING IT CAME INTO MY HEAD
TO LOOK IF THE WICK WERE LONG I TURNED ROUND TO DO SO AND HAD TAKEN
UP THE CANDLE IN MY HAND WHEN IT WAS EXTINGUISHED BY SOME VIOLENT
SHOCK AND THE NEXT THING I COMPREHENDED WAS THAT I HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN
A STRONG RUNNING NOOSE THROWN OVER MY HEAD FROM BEHIND

NOW SAID A SUPPRESSED VOICE WITH AN OATH IVE GOT YOU

WHAT IS THIS I CRIED STRUGGLING WHO IS IT HELP HELP HELP

NOT ONLY WERE MY ARMS PULLED CLOSE TO MY SIDES BUT THE PRESSURE ON MY
BAD ARM CAUSED ME EXQUISITE PAIN SOMETIMES A STRONG MANS HAND
SOMETIMES A STRONG MANS BREAST WAS SET AGAINST MY MOUTH TO DEADEN MY
CRIES AND WITH A HOT BREATH ALWAYS CLOSE TO ME I STRUGGLED
INEFFECTUALLY IN THE DARK WHILE I WAS FASTENED TIGHT TO THE WALL AND
NOW SAID THE SUPPRESSED VOICE WITH ANOTHER OATH CALL OUT AGAIN AND
ILL MAKE SHORT WORK OF YOU

FAINT AND SICK WITH THE PAIN OF MY INJURED ARM BEWILDERED BY THE
SURPRISE AND YET CONSCIOUS HOW EASILY THIS THREAT COULD BE PUT IN
EXECUTION I DESISTED AND TRIED TO EASE MY ARM WERE IT EVER SO LITTLE
BUT IT WAS BOUND TOO TIGHT FOR THAT I FELT AS IF HAVING BEEN BURNT
BEFORE IT WERE NOW BEING BOILED

THE SUDDEN EXCLUSION OF THE NIGHT AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF BLACK
DARKNESS IN ITS PLACE WARNED ME THAT THE MAN HAD CLOSED A SHUTTER
AFTER GROPING ABOUT FOR A LITTLE HE FOUND THE FLINT AND STEEL HE
WANTED AND BEGAN TO STRIKE A LIGHT I STRAINED MY SIGHT UPON THE
SPARKS THAT FELL AMONG THE TINDER AND UPON WHICH HE BREATHED AND
BREATHED MATCH IN HAND BUT I COULD ONLY SEE HIS LIPS AND THE BLUE
POINT OF THE MATCH EVEN THOSE BUT FITFULLY THE TINDER WAS DAMPNO
WONDER THEREAND ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SPARKS DIED OUT

THE MAN WAS IN NO HURRY AND STRUCK AGAIN WITH THE FLINT AND STEEL AS
THE SPARKS FELL THICK AND BRIGHT ABOUT HIM I COULD SEE HIS HANDS AND
TOUCHES OF HIS FACE AND COULD MAKE OUT THAT HE WAS SEATED AND BENDING
OVER THE TABLE BUT NOTHING MORE PRESENTLY I SAW HIS BLUE LIPS AGAIN
BREATHING ON THE TINDER AND THEN A FLARE OF LIGHT FLASHED UP AND
SHOWED ME ORLICK

WHOM I HAD LOOKED FOR I DONT KNOW I HAD NOT LOOKED FOR HIM SEEING
HIM I FELT THAT I WAS IN A DANGEROUS STRAIT INDEED AND I KEPT MY EYES
UPON HIM

HE LIGHTED THE CANDLE FROM THE FLARING MATCH WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
AND DROPPED THE MATCH AND TROD IT OUT THEN HE PUT THE CANDLE AWAY
FROM HIM ON THE TABLE SO THAT HE COULD SEE ME AND SAT WITH HIS ARMS
FOLDED ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED AT ME I MADE OUT THAT I WAS FASTENED TO
A STOUT PERPENDICULAR LADDER A FEW INCHES FROM THE WALLA FIXTURE
THERETHE MEANS OF ASCENT TO THE LOFT ABOVE

NOW SAID HE WHEN WE HAD SURVEYED ONE ANOTHER FOR SOME TIME IVE
GOT YOU

UNBIND ME LET ME GO

AH HE RETURNED ILL LET YOU GO ILL LET YOU GO TO THE MOON
ILL LET YOU GO TO THE STARS ALL IN GOOD TIME

WHY HAVE YOU LURED ME HERE

DONT YOU KNOW SAID HE WITH A DEADLY LOOK

WHY HAVE YOU SET UPON ME IN THE DARK

BECAUSE I MEAN TO DO IT ALL MYSELF ONE KEEPS A SECRET BETTER THAN
TWO O YOU ENEMY YOU ENEMY

HIS ENJOYMENT OF THE SPECTACLE I FURNISHED AS HE SAT WITH HIS ARMS
FOLDED ON THE TABLE SHAKING HIS HEAD AT ME AND HUGGING HIMSELF HAD A
MALIGNITY IN IT THAT MADE ME TREMBLE AS I WATCHED HIM IN SILENCE HE
PUT HIS HAND INTO THE CORNER AT HIS SIDE AND TOOK UP A GUN WITH A
BRASSBOUND STOCK

DO YOU KNOW THIS SAID HE MAKING AS IF HE WOULD TAKE AIM AT ME DO
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU SAW IT AFORE SPEAK WOLF

YES I ANSWERED

ILLUSTRATION

YOU COST ME THAT PLACE YOU DID SPEAK

WHAT ELSE COULD I DO

YOU DID THAT AND THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH WITHOUT MORE HOW DARED YOU TO
COME BETWIXT ME AND A YOUNG WOMAN I LIKED

WHEN DID I

WHEN DIDNT YOU IT WAS YOU AS ALWAYS GIVE OLD ORLICK A BAD NAME TO
HER

YOU GAVE IT TO YOURSELF YOU GAINED IT FOR YOURSELF I COULD HAVE DONE
YOU NO HARM IF YOU HAD DONE YOURSELF NONE

YOURE A LIAR AND YOULL TAKE ANY PAINS AND SPEND ANY MONEY TO
DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS COUNTRY WILL YOU SAID HE REPEATING MY WORDS TO
BIDDY IN THE LAST INTERVIEW I HAD WITH HER NOW ILL TELL YOU A PIECE
OF INFORMATION IT WAS NEVER SO WELL WORTH YOUR WHILE TO GET ME OUT OF
THIS COUNTRY AS IT IS TONIGHT AH IF IT WAS ALL YOUR MONEY TWENTY
TIMES TOLD TO THE LAST BRASS FARDEN AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAVY HAND AT
ME WITH HIS MOUTH SNARLING LIKE A TIGERS I FELT THAT IT WAS TRUE

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO ME

IM AGOING SAID HE BRINGING HIS FIST DOWN UPON THE TABLE WITH A
HEAVY BLOW AND RISING AS THE BLOW FELL TO GIVE IT GREATER FORCEIM
AGOING TO HAVE YOUR LIFE

HE LEANED FORWARD STARING AT ME SLOWLY UNCLENCHED HIS HAND AND DREW IT
ACROSS HIS MOUTH AS IF HIS MOUTH WATERED FOR ME AND SAT DOWN AGAIN

YOU WAS ALWAYS IN OLD ORLICKS WAY SINCE EVER YOU WAS A CHILD YOU
GOES OUT OF HIS WAY THIS PRESENT NIGHT HELL HAVE NO MORE ON YOU
YOURE DEAD

I FELT THAT I HAD COME TO THE BRINK OF MY GRAVE FOR A MOMENT I LOOKED
WILDLY ROUND MY TRAP FOR ANY CHANCE OF ESCAPE BUT THERE WAS NONE

MORE THAN THAT SAID HE FOLDING HIS ARMS ON THE TABLE AGAIN I
WONT HAVE A RAG OF YOU I WONT HAVE A BONE OF YOU LEFT ON EARTH
ILL PUT YOUR BODY IN THE KILNID CARRY TWO SUCH TO IT ON MY
SHOULDERSAND LET PEOPLE SUPPOSE WHAT THEY MAY OF YOU THEY SHALL
NEVER KNOW NOTHING

MY MIND WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY FOLLOWED OUT ALL THE CONSEQUENCES
OF SUCH A DEATH ESTELLAS FATHER WOULD BELIEVE I HAD DESERTED HIM
WOULD BE TAKEN WOULD DIE ACCUSING ME EVEN HERBERT WOULD DOUBT ME
WHEN HE COMPARED THE LETTER I HAD LEFT FOR HIM WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD
CALLED AT MISS HAVISHAMS GATE FOR ONLY A MOMENT JOE AND BIDDY WOULD
NEVER KNOW HOW SORRY I HAD BEEN THAT NIGHT NONE WOULD EVER KNOW WHAT I
HAD SUFFERED HOW TRUE I HAD MEANT TO BE WHAT AN AGONY I HAD PASSED
THROUGH THE DEATH CLOSE BEFORE ME WAS TERRIBLE BUT FAR MORE TERRIBLE
THAN DEATH WAS THE DREAD OF BEING MISREMEMBERED AFTER DEATH AND SO
QUICK WERE MY THOUGHTS THAT I SAW MYSELF DESPISED BY UNBORN
GENERATIONSESTELLAS CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDRENWHILE THE WRETCHS
WORDS WERE YET ON HIS LIPS

NOW WOLF SAID HE AFORE I KILL YOU LIKE ANY OTHER BEASTWHICH IS
WOT I MEAN TO DO AND WOT I HAVE TIED YOU UP FORILL HAVE A GOOD LOOK
AT YOU AND A GOOD GOAD AT YOU O YOU ENEMY

IT HAD PASSED THROUGH MY THOUGHTS TO CRY OUT FOR HELP AGAIN THOUGH FEW
COULD KNOW BETTER THAN I THE SOLITARY NATURE OF THE SPOT AND THE
HOPELESSNESS OF AID BUT AS HE SAT GLOATING OVER ME I WAS SUPPORTED BY
A SCORNFUL DETESTATION OF HIM THAT SEALED MY LIPS ABOVE ALL THINGS I
RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT ENTREAT HIM AND THAT I WOULD DIE MAKING SOME
LAST POOR RESISTANCE TO HIM SOFTENED AS MY THOUGHTS OF ALL THE REST OF
MEN WERE IN THAT DIRE EXTREMITY HUMBLY BESEECHING PARDON AS I DID OF
HEAVEN MELTED AT HEART AS I WAS BY THE THOUGHT THAT I HAD TAKEN NO
FAREWELL AND NEVER NOW COULD TAKE FAREWELL OF THOSE WHO WERE DEAR TO
ME OR COULD EXPLAIN MYSELF TO THEM OR ASK FOR THEIR COMPASSION ON MY
MISERABLE ERRORSSTILL IF I COULD HAVE KILLED HIM EVEN IN DYING I
WOULD HAVE DONE IT

HE HAD BEEN DRINKING AND HIS EYES WERE RED AND BLOODSHOT AROUND HIS
NECK WAS SLUNG A TIN BOTTLE AS I HAD OFTEN SEEN HIS MEAT AND DRINK
SLUNG ABOUT HIM IN OTHER DAYS HE BROUGHT THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS AND
TOOK A FIERY DRINK FROM IT AND I SMELT THE STRONG SPIRITS THAT I SAW
FLASH INTO HIS FACE

WOLF SAID HE FOLDING HIS ARMS AGAIN OLD ORLICKS AGOING TO TELL
YOU SOMETHINK IT WAS YOU AS DID FOR YOUR SHREW SISTER

AGAIN MY MIND WITH ITS FORMER INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY HAD EXHAUSTED
THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF THE ATTACK UPON MY SISTER HER ILLNESS AND HER
DEATH BEFORE HIS SLOW AND HESITATING SPEECH HAD FORMED THESE WORDS

IT WAS YOU VILLAIN SAID I

I TELL YOU IT WAS YOUR DOINGI TELL YOU IT WAS DONE THROUGH YOU HE
RETORTED CATCHING UP THE GUN AND MAKING A BLOW WITH THE STOCK AT THE
VACANT AIR BETWEEN US I COME UPON HER FROM BEHIND AS I COME UPON YOU
TONIGHT I GIV IT HER I LEFT HER FOR DEAD AND IF THERE HAD BEEN A
LIMEKILN AS NIGH HER AS THERE IS NOW NIGH YOU SHE SHOULDNT HAVE COME
TO LIFE AGAIN BUT IT WARNT OLD ORLICK AS DID IT IT WAS YOU YOU WAS
FAVOURED AND HE WAS BULLIED AND BEAT OLD ORLICK BULLIED AND BEAT EH
NOW YOU PAYS FOR IT YOU DONE IT NOW YOU PAYS FOR IT

HE DRANK AGAIN AND BECAME MORE FEROCIOUS I SAW BY HIS TILTING OF THE
BOTTLE THAT THERE WAS NO GREAT QUANTITY LEFT IN IT I DISTINCTLY
UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS WORKING HIMSELF UP WITH ITS CONTENTS TO MAKE AN
END OF ME I KNEW THAT EVERY DROP IT HELD WAS A DROP OF MY LIFE I KNEW
THAT WHEN I WAS CHANGED INTO A PART OF THE VAPOUR THAT HAD CREPT
TOWARDS ME BUT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE LIKE MY OWN WARNING GHOST HE
WOULD DO AS HE HAD DONE IN MY SISTERS CASEMAKE ALL HASTE TO THE
TOWN AND BE SEEN SLOUCHING ABOUT THERE DRINKING AT THE ALEHOUSES MY
RAPID MIND PURSUED HIM TO THE TOWN MADE A PICTURE OF THE STREET WITH
HIM IN IT AND CONTRASTED ITS LIGHTS AND LIFE WITH THE LONELY MARSH AND
THE WHITE VAPOUR CREEPING OVER IT INTO WHICH I SHOULD HAVE DISSOLVED

IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT I COULD HAVE SUMMED UP YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS
WHILE HE SAID A DOZEN WORDS BUT THAT WHAT HE DID SAY PRESENTED
PICTURES TO ME AND NOT MERE WORDS IN THE EXCITED AND EXALTED STATE OF
MY BRAIN I COULD NOT THINK OF A PLACE WITHOUT SEEING IT OR OF PERSONS
WITHOUT SEEING THEM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE VIVIDNESS OF
THESE IMAGES AND YET I WAS SO INTENT ALL THE TIME UPON HIM
HIMSELFWHO WOULD NOT BE INTENT ON THE TIGER CROUCHING TO SPRINGTHAT
I KNEW OF THE SLIGHTEST ACTION OF HIS FINGERS

WHEN HE HAD DRUNK THIS SECOND TIME HE ROSE FROM THE BENCH ON WHICH HE
SAT AND PUSHED THE TABLE ASIDE THEN HE TOOK UP THE CANDLE AND
SHADING IT WITH HIS MURDEROUS HAND SO AS TO THROW ITS LIGHT ON ME
STOOD BEFORE ME LOOKING AT ME AND ENJOYING THE SIGHT

WOLF ILL TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE IT WAS OLD ORLICK AS YOU TUMBLED
OVER ON YOUR STAIRS THAT NIGHT

I SAW THE STAIRCASE WITH ITS EXTINGUISHED LAMPS I SAW THE SHADOWS OF
THE HEAVY STAIRRAILS THROWN BY THE WATCHMANS LANTERN ON THE WALL I
SAW THE ROOMS THAT I WAS NEVER TO SEE AGAIN HERE A DOOR HALF OPEN
THERE A DOOR CLOSED ALL THE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE AROUND

AND WHY WAS OLD ORLICK THERE ILL TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE WOLF YOU

IN HIS SAVAGE TAUNTING HE FLARED THE CANDLE SO CLOSE AT ME THAT I
TURNED MY FACE ASIDE TO SAVE IT FROM THE FLAME

AH HE CRIED LAUGHING AFTER DOING IT AGAIN THE BURNT CHILD DREADS
THE FIRE OLD ORLICK KNOWED YOU WAS BURNT OLD ORLICK KNOWED YOU WAS
SMUGGLING YOUR UNCLE PROVIS AWAY OLD ORLICKS A MATCH FOR YOU AND

UNBEKNOWN AND PUT THEM IN DANGER PRAPS ITS THEM THAT WRITES FIFTY
HANDS AND THATS NOT LIKE SNEAKING YOU AS WRITES BUT ONE WARE
COMPEYSON MAGWITCH AND THE GALLOWS

HE FLARED THE CANDLE AT ME AGAIN SMOKING MY FACE AND HAIR AND FOR AN
INSTANT BLINDING ME AND TURNED HIS POWERFUL BACK AS HE REPLACED THE
LIGHT ON THE TABLE I HAD THOUGHT A PRAYER AND HAD BEEN WITH JOE AND
BIDDY AND HERBERT BEFORE HE TURNED TOWARDS ME AGAIN

THERE WAS A CLEAR SPACE OF A FEW FEET BETWEEN THE TABLE AND THE
OPPOSITE WALL WITHIN THIS SPACE HE NOW SLOUCHED BACKWARDS AND
FORWARDS HIS GREAT STRENGTH SEEMED TO SIT STRONGER UPON HIM THAN EVER
BEFORE AS HE DID THIS WITH HIS HANDS HANGING LOOSE AND HEAVY AT HIS
SIDES AND WITH HIS EYES SCOWLING AT ME I HAD NO GRAIN OF HOPE LEFT
WILD AS MY INWARD HURRY WAS AND WONDERFUL THE FORCE OF THE PICTURES
THAT RUSHED BY ME INSTEAD OF THOUGHTS I COULD YET CLEARLY UNDERSTAND
THAT UNLESS HE HAD RESOLVED THAT I WAS WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS OF SURELY
PERISHING OUT OF ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD ME WHAT
HE HAD TOLD

OF A SUDDEN HE STOPPED TOOK THE CORK OUT OF HIS BOTTLE AND TOSSED IT
AWAY LIGHT AS IT WAS I HEARD IT FALL LIKE A PLUMMET HE SWALLOWED
SLOWLY TILTING UP THE BOTTLE BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND NOW HE LOOKED
AT ME NO MORE THE LAST FEW DROPS OF LIQUOR HE POURED INTO THE PALM OF
HIS HAND AND LICKED UP THEN WITH A SUDDEN HURRY OF VIOLENCE AND
SWEARING HORRIBLY HE THREW THE BOTTLE FROM HIM AND STOOPED AND I SAW
IN HIS HAND A STONEHAMMER WITH A LONG HEAVY HANDLE

THE RESOLUTION I HAD MADE DID NOT DESERT ME FOR WITHOUT UTTERING ONE
VAIN WORD OF APPEAL TO HIM I SHOUTED OUT WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND
STRUGGLED WITH ALL MY MIGHT IT WAS ONLY MY HEAD AND MY LEGS THAT I
COULD MOVE BUT TO THAT EXTENT I STRUGGLED WITH ALL THE FORCE UNTIL
THEN UNKNOWN THAT WAS WITHIN ME IN THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD
RESPONSIVE SHOUTS SAW FIGURES AND A GLEAM OF LIGHT DASH IN AT THE
DOOR HEARD VOICES AND TUMULT AND SAW ORLICK EMERGE FROM A STRUGGLE OF
MEN AS IF IT WERE TUMBLING WATER CLEAR THE TABLE AT A LEAP AND FLY
OUT INTO THE NIGHT

AFTER A BLANK I FOUND THAT I WAS LYING UNBOUND ON THE FLOOR IN THE
SAME PLACE WITH MY HEAD ON SOME ONES KNEE MY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE
LADDER AGAINST THE WALL WHEN I CAME TO MYSELFHAD OPENED ON IT BEFORE
MY MIND SAW ITAND THUS AS I RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS I KNEW THAT I
WAS IN THE PLACE WHERE I HAD LOST IT

TOO INDIFFERENT AT FIRST EVEN TO LOOK ROUND AND ASCERTAIN WHO
SUPPORTED ME I WAS LYING LOOKING AT THE LADDER WHEN THERE CAME
BETWEEN ME AND IT A FACE THE FACE OF TRABBS BOY

I THINK HES ALL RIGHT SAID TRABBS BOY IN A SOBER VOICE BUT
AINT HE JUST PALE THOUGH

AT THESE WORDS THE FACE OF HIM WHO SUPPORTED ME LOOKED OVER INTO MINE
AND I SAW MY SUPPORTER TO BE

HERBERT GREAT HEAVEN

SOFTLY SAID HERBERT GENTLY HANDEL DONT BE TOO EAGER

AND OUR OLD COMRADE STARTOP I CRIED AS HE TOO BENT OVER ME

REMEMBER WHAT HE IS GOING TO ASSIST US IN SAID HERBERT AND BE
CALM

THE ALLUSION MADE ME SPRING UP THOUGH I DROPPED AGAIN FROM THE PAIN IN
MY ARM THE TIME HAS NOT GONE BY HERBERT HAS IT WHAT NIGHT IS
TONIGHT HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE FOR I HAD A STRANGE AND STRONG
MISGIVING THAT I HAD BEEN LYING THERE A LONG TIMEA DAY AND A
NIGHTTWO DAYS AND NIGHTSMORE

THE TIME HAS NOT GONE BY IT IS STILL MONDAY NIGHT

THANK GOD

AND YOU HAVE ALL TOMORROW TUESDAY TO REST IN SAID HERBERT BUT
YOU CANT HELP GROANING MY DEAR HANDEL WHAT HURT HAVE YOU GOT CAN
YOU STAND

YES YES SAID I I CAN WALK I HAVE NO HURT BUT IN THIS THROBBING
ARM

THEY LAID IT BARE AND DID WHAT THEY COULD IT WAS VIOLENTLY SWOLLEN
AND INFLAMED AND I COULD SCARCELY ENDURE TO HAVE IT TOUCHED BUT THEY
TORE UP THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS TO MAKE FRESH BANDAGES AND CAREFULLY
REPLACED IT IN THE SLING UNTIL WE COULD GET TO THE TOWN AND OBTAIN
SOME COOLING LOTION TO PUT UPON IT IN A LITTLE WHILE WE HAD SHUT THE
DOOR OF THE DARK AND EMPTY SLUICEHOUSE AND WERE PASSING THROUGH THE
QUARRY ON OUR WAY BACK TRABBS BOYTRABBS OVERGROWN YOUNG MAN
NOWWENT BEFORE US WITH A LANTERN WHICH WAS THE LIGHT I HAD SEEN COME
IN AT THE DOOR BUT THE MOON WAS A GOOD TWO HOURS HIGHER THAN WHEN I
HAD LAST SEEN THE SKY AND THE NIGHT THOUGH RAINY WAS MUCH LIGHTER
THE WHITE VAPOUR OF THE KILN WAS PASSING FROM US AS WE WENT BY AND AS
I HAD THOUGHT A PRAYER BEFORE I THOUGHT A THANKSGIVING NOW

ENTREATING HERBERT TO TELL ME HOW HE HAD COME TO MY RESCUEWHICH AT
FIRST HE HAD FLATLY REFUSED TO DO BUT HAD INSISTED ON MY REMAINING
QUIETI LEARNT THAT I HAD IN MY HURRY DROPPED THE LETTER OPEN IN OUR
CHAMBERS WHERE HE COMING HOME TO BRING WITH HIM STARTOP WHOM HE HAD
MET IN THE STREET ON HIS WAY TO ME FOUND IT VERY SOON AFTER I WAS
GONE ITS TONE MADE HIM UNEASY AND THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE
INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN IT AND THE HASTY LETTER I HAD LEFT FOR HIM HIS
UNEASINESS INCREASING INSTEAD OF SUBSIDING AFTER A QUARTER OF AN
HOURS CONSIDERATION HE SET OFF FOR THE COACHOFFICE WITH STARTOP WHO
VOLUNTEERED HIS COMPANY TO MAKE INQUIRY WHEN THE NEXT COACH WENT DOWN
FINDING THAT THE AFTERNOON COACH WAS GONE AND FINDING THAT HIS
UNEASINESS GREW INTO POSITIVE ALARM AS OBSTACLES CAME IN HIS WAY HE
RESOLVED TO FOLLOW IN A POSTCHAISE SO HE AND STARTOP ARRIVED AT THE
BLUE BOAR FULLY EXPECTING THERE TO FIND ME OR TIDINGS OF ME BUT
FINDING NEITHER WENT ON TO MISS HAVISHAMS WHERE THEY LOST ME
HEREUPON THEY WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL DOUBTLESS AT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN
I WAS HEARING THE POPULAR LOCAL VERSION OF MY OWN STORY TO REFRESH
THEMSELVES AND TO GET SOME ONE TO GUIDE THEM OUT UPON THE MARSHES
AMONG THE LOUNGERS UNDER THE BOARS ARCHWAY HAPPENED TO BE TRABBS
BOYTRUE TO HIS ANCIENT HABIT OF HAPPENING TO BE EVERYWHERE WHERE HE
HAD NO BUSINESSAND TRABBS BOY HAD SEEN ME PASSING FROM MISS
HAVISHAMS IN THE DIRECTION OF MY DININGPLACE THUS TRABBS BOY BECAME
THEIR GUIDE AND WITH HIM THEY WENT OUT TO THE SLUICEHOUSE THOUGH BY
THE TOWN WAY TO THE MARSHES WHICH I HAD AVOIDED NOW AS THEY WENT
ALONG HERBERT REFLECTED THAT I MIGHT AFTER ALL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT
THERE ON SOME GENUINE AND SERVICEABLE ERRAND TENDING TO PROVISS
SAFETY AND BETHINKING HIMSELF THAT IN THAT CASE INTERRUPTION MUST BE
MISCHIEVOUS LEFT HIS GUIDE AND STARTOP ON THE EDGE OF THE QUARRY AND
WENT ON BY HIMSELF AND STOLE ROUND THE HOUSE TWO OR THREE TIMES
ENDEAVOURING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ALL WAS RIGHT WITHIN AS HE COULD
HEAR NOTHING BUT INDISTINCT SOUNDS OF ONE DEEP ROUGH VOICE THIS WAS
WHILE MY MIND WAS SO BUSY HE EVEN AT LAST BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER I
WAS THERE WHEN SUDDENLY I CRIED OUT LOUDLY AND HE ANSWERED THE CRIES
AND RUSHED IN CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER TWO

WHEN I TOLD HERBERT WHAT HAD PASSED WITHIN THE HOUSE HE WAS FOR OUR
IMMEDIATELY GOING BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN THE TOWN LATE AT NIGHT AS IT
WAS AND GETTING OUT A WARRANT BUT I HAD ALREADY CONSIDERED THAT SUCH
A COURSE BY DETAINING US THERE OR BINDING US TO COME BACK MIGHT BE
FATAL TO PROVIS THERE WAS NO GAINSAYING THIS DIFFICULTY AND WE
RELINQUISHED ALL THOUGHTS OF PURSUING ORLICK AT THAT TIME FOR THE
PRESENT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE DEEMED IT PRUDENT TO MAKE RATHER
LIGHT OF THE MATTER TO TRABBS BOY WHO I AM CONVINCED WOULD HAVE
BEEN MUCH AFFECTED BY DISAPPOINTMENT IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT HIS
INTERVENTION SAVED ME FROM THE LIMEKILN NOT THAT TRABBS BOY WAS OF A
MALIGNANT NATURE BUT THAT HE HAD TOO MUCH SPARE VIVACITY AND THAT IT
WAS IN HIS CONSTITUTION TO WANT VARIETY AND EXCITEMENT AT ANYBODYS
EXPENSE WHEN WE PARTED I PRESENTED HIM WITH TWO GUINEAS WHICH SEEMED
TO MEET HIS VIEWS AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS SORRY EVER TO HAVE HAD AN
ILL OPINION OF HIM WHICH MADE NO IMPRESSION ON HIM AT ALL

WEDNESDAY BEING SO CLOSE UPON US WE DETERMINED TO GO BACK TO LONDON
THAT NIGHT THREE IN THE POSTCHAISE THE RATHER AS WE SHOULD THEN BE
CLEAR AWAY BEFORE THE NIGHTS ADVENTURE BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF HERBERT
GOT A LARGE BOTTLE OF STUFF FOR MY ARM AND BY DINT OF HAVING THIS
STUFF DROPPED OVER IT ALL THE NIGHT THROUGH I WAS JUST ABLE TO BEAR
ITS PAIN ON THE JOURNEY IT WAS DAYLIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE TEMPLE
AND I WENT AT ONCE TO BED AND LAY IN BED ALL DAY

MY TERROR AS I LAY THERE OF FALLING ILL AND BEING UNFITTED FOR
TOMORROW WAS SO BESETTING THAT I WONDER IT DID NOT DISABLE ME OF
ITSELF IT WOULD HAVE DONE SO PRETTY SURELY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
MENTAL WEAR AND TEAR I HAD SUFFERED BUT FOR THE UNNATURAL STRAIN UPON
ME THAT TOMORROW WAS SO ANXIOUSLY LOOKED FORWARD TO CHARGED WITH
SUCH CONSEQUENCES ITS RESULTS SO IMPENETRABLY HIDDEN THOUGH SO NEAR

NO PRECAUTION COULD HAVE BEEN MORE OBVIOUS THAN OUR REFRAINING FROM
COMMUNICATION WITH HIM THAT DAY YET THIS AGAIN INCREASED MY
RESTLESSNESS I STARTED AT EVERY FOOTSTEP AND EVERY SOUND BELIEVING
THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED AND TAKEN AND THIS WAS THE MESSENGER TO TELL ME
SO I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I KNEW HE WAS TAKEN THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING MORE UPON MY MIND THAN A FEAR OR A PRESENTIMENT THAT THE
FACT HAD OCCURRED AND I HAD A MYSTERIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF IT AS THE DAYS
WORE ON AND NO ILL NEWS CAME AS THE DAY CLOSED IN AND DARKNESS FELL
MY OVERSHADOWING DREAD OF BEING DISABLED BY ILLNESS BEFORE TOMORROW
MORNING ALTOGETHER MASTERED ME MY BURNING ARM THROBBED AND MY BURNING
HEAD THROBBED AND I FANCIED I WAS BEGINNING TO WANDER I COUNTED UP TO
HIGH NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE OF MYSELF AND REPEATED PASSAGES THAT I KNEW
IN PROSE AND VERSE IT HAPPENED SOMETIMES THAT IN THE MERE ESCAPE OF A
FATIGUED MIND I DOZED FOR SOME MOMENTS OR FORGOT THEN I WOULD SAY TO
MYSELF WITH A START NOW IT HAS COME AND I AM TURNING DELIRIOUS

THEY KEPT ME VERY QUIET ALL DAY AND KEPT MY ARM CONSTANTLY DRESSED
AND GAVE ME COOLING DRINKS WHENEVER I FELL ASLEEP I AWOKE WITH THE
NOTION I HAD HAD IN THE SLUICEHOUSE THAT A LONG TIME HAD ELAPSED AND
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE HIM WAS GONE ABOUT MIDNIGHT I GOT OUT OF BED
AND WENT TO HERBERT WITH THE CONVICTION THAT I HAD BEEN ASLEEP FOR
FOURANDTWENTY HOURS AND THAT WEDNESDAY WAS PAST IT WAS THE LAST
SELFEXHAUSTING EFFORT OF MY FRETFULNESS FOR AFTER THAT I SLEPT
SOUNDLY

WEDNESDAY MORNING WAS DAWNING WHEN I LOOKED OUT OF WINDOW THE WINKING
LIGHTS UPON THE BRIDGES WERE ALREADY PALE THE COMING SUN WAS LIKE A
MARSH OF FIRE ON THE HORIZON THE RIVER STILL DARK AND MYSTERIOUS WAS
SPANNED BY BRIDGES THAT WERE TURNING COLDLY GREY WITH HERE AND THERE
AT TOP A WARM TOUCH FROM THE BURNING IN THE SKY AS I LOOKED ALONG THE
CLUSTERED ROOFS WITH CHURCHTOWERS AND SPIRES SHOOTING INTO THE
UNUSUALLY CLEAR AIR THE SUN ROSE UP AND A VEIL SEEMED TO BE DRAWN
FROM THE RIVER AND MILLIONS OF SPARKLES BURST OUT UPON ITS WATERS
FROM ME TOO A VEIL SEEMED TO BE DRAWN AND I FELT STRONG AND WELL

HERBERT LAY ASLEEP IN HIS BED AND OUR OLD FELLOWSTUDENT LAY ASLEEP ON
THE SOFA I COULD NOT DRESS MYSELF WITHOUT HELP BUT I MADE UP THE
FIRE WHICH WAS STILL BURNING AND GOT SOME COFFEE READY FOR THEM IN
GOOD TIME THEY TOO STARTED UP STRONG AND WELL AND WE ADMITTED THE
SHARP MORNING AIR AT THE WINDOWS AND LOOKED AT THE TIDE THAT WAS STILL
FLOWING TOWARDS US

WHEN IT TURNS AT NINE OCLOCK SAID HERBERT CHEERFULLY LOOK OUT
FOR US AND STAND READY YOU OVER THERE AT MILL POND BANK




CHAPTER LIV


IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MARCH DAYS WHEN THE SUN SHINES HOT AND THE WIND
BLOWS COLD WHEN IT IS SUMMER IN THE LIGHT AND WINTER IN THE SHADE WE
HAD OUR PEACOATS WITH US AND I TOOK A BAG OF ALL MY WORLDLY
POSSESSIONS I TOOK NO MORE THAN THE FEW NECESSARIES THAT FILLED THE
BAG WHERE I MIGHT GO WHAT I MIGHT DO OR WHEN I MIGHT RETURN WERE
QUESTIONS UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO ME NOR DID I VEX MY MIND WITH THEM FOR
IT WAS WHOLLY SET ON PROVISS SAFETY I ONLY WONDERED FOR THE PASSING
MOMENT AS I STOPPED AT THE DOOR AND LOOKED BACK UNDER WHAT ALTERED
CIRCUMSTANCES I SHOULD NEXT SEE THOSE ROOMS IF EVER

WE LOITERED DOWN TO THE TEMPLE STAIRS AND STOOD LOITERING THERE AS IF
WE WERE NOT QUITE DECIDED TO GO UPON THE WATER AT ALL OF COURSE I HAD
TAKEN CARE THAT THE BOAT SHOULD BE READY AND EVERYTHING IN ORDER AFTER
A LITTLE SHOW OF INDECISION WHICH THERE WERE NONE TO SEE BUT THE TWO
OR THREE AMPHIBIOUS CREATURES BELONGING TO OUR TEMPLE STAIRS WE WENT
ON BOARD AND CAST OFF HERBERT IN THE BOW I STEERING IT WAS THEN
ABOUT HIGHWATERHALFPAST EIGHT

OUR PLAN WAS THIS THE TIDE BEGINNING TO RUN DOWN AT NINE AND BEING
WITH US UNTIL THREE WE INTENDED STILL TO CREEP ON AFTER IT HAD TURNED
AND ROW AGAINST IT UNTIL DARK WE SHOULD THEN BE WELL IN THOSE LONG
REACHES BELOW GRAVESEND BETWEEN KENT AND ESSEX WHERE THE RIVER IS
BROAD AND SOLITARY WHERE THE WATERSIDE INHABITANTS ARE VERY FEW AND
WHERE LONE PUBLICHOUSES ARE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE OF WHICH WE
COULD CHOOSE ONE FOR A RESTINGPLACE THERE WE MEANT TO LIE BY ALL
NIGHT THE STEAMER FOR HAMBURG AND THE STEAMER FOR ROTTERDAM WOULD
START FROM LONDON AT ABOUT NINE ON THURSDAY MORNING WE SHOULD KNOW AT
WHAT TIME TO EXPECT THEM ACCORDING TO WHERE WE WERE AND WOULD HAIL
THE FIRST SO THAT IF BY ANY ACCIDENT WE WERE NOT TAKEN ABROAD WE
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE WE KNEW THE DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF EACH
VESSEL

THE RELIEF OF BEING AT LAST ENGAGED IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PURPOSE WAS
SO GREAT TO ME THAT I FELT IT DIFFICULT TO REALISE THE CONDITION IN
WHICH I HAD BEEN A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE CRISP AIR THE SUNLIGHT THE
MOVEMENT ON THE RIVER AND THE MOVING RIVER ITSELFTHE ROAD THAT RAN
WITH US SEEMING TO SYMPATHISE WITH US ANIMATE US AND ENCOURAGE US
ONFRESHENED ME WITH NEW HOPE I FELT MORTIFIED TO BE OF SO LITTLE USE
IN THE BOAT BUT THERE WERE FEW BETTER OARSMEN THAN MY TWO FRIENDS
AND THEY ROWED WITH A STEADY STROKE THAT WAS TO LAST ALL DAY

AT THAT TIME THE STEAMTRAFFIC ON THE THAMES WAS FAR BELOW ITS PRESENT
EXTENT AND WATERMENS BOATS WERE FAR MORE NUMEROUS OF BARGES SAILING
COLLIERS AND COASTINGTRADERS THERE WERE PERHAPS AS MANY AS NOW BUT
OF STEAMSHIPS GREAT AND SMALL NOT A TITHE OR A TWENTIETH PART SO
MANY EARLY AS IT WAS THERE WERE PLENTY OF SCULLERS GOING HERE AND
THERE THAT MORNING AND PLENTY OF BARGES DROPPING DOWN WITH THE TIDE
THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER BETWEEN BRIDGES IN AN OPEN BOAT WAS A
MUCH EASIER AND COMMONER MATTER IN THOSE DAYS THAN IT IS IN THESE AND
WE WENT AHEAD AMONG MANY SKIFFS AND WHERRIES BRISKLY

OLD LONDON BRIDGE WAS SOON PASSED AND OLD BILLINGSGATE MARKET WITH ITS
OYSTERBOATS AND DUTCHMEN AND THE WHITE TOWER AND TRAITORS GATE AND
WE WERE IN AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING HERE WERE THE LEITH ABERDEEN
AND GLASGOW STEAMERS LOADING AND UNLOADING GOODS AND LOOKING
IMMENSELY HIGH OUT OF THE WATER AS WE PASSED ALONGSIDE HERE WERE
COLLIERS BY THE SCORE AND SCORE WITH THE COALWHIPPERS PLUNGING OFF
STAGES ON DECK AS COUNTERWEIGHTS TO MEASURES OF COAL SWINGING UP
WHICH WERE THEN RATTLED OVER THE SIDE INTO BARGES HERE AT HER
MOORINGS WAS TOMORROWS STEAMER FOR ROTTERDAM OF WHICH WE TOOK GOOD
NOTICE AND HERE TOMORROWS FOR HAMBURG UNDER WHOSE BOWSPRIT WE
CROSSED AND NOW I SITTING IN THE STERN COULD SEE WITH A FASTER
BEATING HEART MILL POND BANK AND MILL POND STAIRS

IS HE THERE SAID HERBERT

NOT YET

RIGHT HE WAS NOT TO COME DOWN TILL HE SAW US CAN YOU SEE HIS
SIGNAL

NOT WELL FROM HERE BUT I THINK I SEE ITNOW I SEE HIM PULL BOTH
EASY HERBERT OARS

WE TOUCHED THE STAIRS LIGHTLY FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AND HE WAS ON BOARD
AND WE WERE OFF AGAIN HE HAD A BOATCLOAK WITH HIM AND A BLACK CANVAS
BAG AND HE LOOKED AS LIKE A RIVERPILOT AS MY HEART COULD HAVE WISHED

DEAR BOY HE SAID PUTTING HIS ARM ON MY SHOULDER AS HE TOOK HIS
SEAT FAITHFUL DEAR BOY WELL DONE THANKYE THANKYE

AGAIN AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING IN AND OUT AVOIDING RUSTY
CHAINCABLES FRAYED HEMPEN HAWSERS AND BOBBING BUOYS SINKING FOR THE
MOMENT FLOATING BROKEN BASKETS SCATTERING FLOATING CHIPS OF WOOD AND
SHAVING CLEAVING FLOATING SCUM OF COAL IN AND OUT UNDER THE
FIGUREHEAD OF THE JOHN OF SUNDERLAND MAKING A SPEECH TO THE WINDS
AS IS DONE BY MANY JOHNS AND THE BETSY OF YARMOUTH WITH A FIRM
FORMALITY OF BOSOM AND HER KNOBBY EYES STARTING TWO INCHES OUT OF HER
HEAD IN AND OUT HAMMERS GOING IN SHIPBUILDERS YARDS SAWS GOING AT
TIMBER CLASHING ENGINES GOING AT THINGS UNKNOWN PUMPS GOING IN LEAKY
SHIPS CAPSTANS GOING SHIPS GOING OUT TO SEA AND UNINTELLIGIBLE
SEACREATURES ROARING CURSES OVER THE BULWARKS AT RESPONDENT
LIGHTERMEN IN AND OUTOUT AT LAST UPON THE CLEARER RIVER WHERE THE
SHIPS BOYS MIGHT TAKE THEIR FENDERS IN NO LONGER FISHING IN TROUBLED
WATERS WITH THEM OVER THE SIDE AND WHERE THE FESTOONED SAILS MIGHT FLY
OUT TO THE WIND

AT THE STAIRS WHERE WE HAD TAKEN HIM ABROAD AND EVER SINCE I HAD
LOOKED WARILY FOR ANY TOKEN OF OUR BEING SUSPECTED I HAD SEEN NONE WE
CERTAINLY HAD NOT BEEN AND AT THAT TIME AS CERTAINLY WE WERE NOT
EITHER ATTENDED OR FOLLOWED BY ANY BOAT IF WE HAD BEEN WAITED ON BY
ANY BOAT I SHOULD HAVE RUN IN TO SHORE AND HAVE OBLIGED HER TO GO ON
OR TO MAKE HER PURPOSE EVIDENT BUT WE HELD OUR OWN WITHOUT ANY
APPEARANCE OF MOLESTATION

HE HAD HIS BOATCLOAK ON HIM AND LOOKED AS I HAVE SAID A NATURAL
PART OF THE SCENE IT WAS REMARKABLE BUT PERHAPS THE WRETCHED LIFE HE
HAD LED ACCOUNTED FOR IT THAT HE WAS THE LEAST ANXIOUS OF ANY OF US
HE WAS NOT INDIFFERENT FOR HE TOLD ME THAT HE HOPED TO LIVE TO SEE HIS
GENTLEMAN ONE OF THE BEST OF GENTLEMEN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY HE WAS NOT
DISPOSED TO BE PASSIVE OR RESIGNED AS I UNDERSTOOD IT BUT HE HAD NO
NOTION OF MEETING DANGER HALF WAY WHEN IT CAME UPON HIM HE CONFRONTED
IT BUT IT MUST COME BEFORE HE TROUBLED HIMSELF

IF YOU KNOWED DEAR BOY HE SAID TO ME WHAT IT IS TO SIT HERE
ALONGER MY DEAR BOY AND HAVE MY SMOKE ARTER HAVING BEEN DAY BY DAY
BETWIXT FOUR WALLS YOUD ENVY ME BUT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS

I THINK I KNOW THE DELIGHTS OF FREEDOM I ANSWERED

AH SAID HE SHAKING HIS HEAD GRAVELY BUT YOU DONT KNOW IT EQUAL
TO ME YOU MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER LOCK AND KEY DEAR BOY TO KNOW IT
EQUAL TO MEBUT I AINT AGOING TO BE LOW

IT OCCURRED TO ME AS INCONSISTENT THAT FOR ANY MASTERING IDEA HE
SHOULD HAVE ENDANGERED HIS FREEDOM AND EVEN HIS LIFE BUT I REFLECTED
THAT PERHAPS FREEDOM WITHOUT DANGER WAS TOO MUCH APART FROM ALL THE
HABIT OF HIS EXISTENCE TO BE TO HIM WHAT IT WOULD BE TO ANOTHER MAN I
WAS NOT FAR OUT SINCE HE SAID AFTER SMOKING A LITTLE

YOU SEE DEAR BOY WHEN I WAS OVER YONDER TOTHER SIDE THE WORLD I
WAS ALWAYS A LOOKING TO THIS SIDE AND IT COME FLAT TO BE THERE FOR
ALL I WAS A GROWING RICH EVERYBODY KNOWED MAGWITCH AND MAGWITCH COULD
COME AND MAGWITCH COULD GO AND NOBODYS HEAD WOULD BE TROUBLED ABOUT
HIM THEY AINT SO EASY CONCERNING ME HERE DEAR BOYWOULDNT BE
LEASTWISE IF THEY KNOWED WHERE I WAS

IF ALL GOES WELL SAID I YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY FREE AND SAFE AGAIN
WITHIN A FEW HOURS

WELL HE RETURNED DRAWING A LONG BREATH I HOPE SO

AND THINK SO

HE DIPPED HIS HAND IN THE WATER OVER THE BOATS GUNWALE AND SAID
SMILING WITH THAT SOFTENED AIR UPON HIM WHICH WAS NOT NEW TO ME

AY I SPOSE I THINK SO DEAR BOY WED BE PUZZLED TO BE MORE QUIET
AND EASYGOING THAN WE ARE AT PRESENT BUTITS A FLOWING SO SOFT AND
PLEASANT THROUGH THE WATER PRAPS AS MAKES ME THINK ITI WAS A
THINKING THROUGH MY SMOKE JUST THEN THAT WE CAN NO MORE SEE TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE NEXT FEW HOURS THAN WE CAN SEE TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
RIVER WHAT I CATCHES HOLD OF NOR YET WE CANT NO MORE HOLD THEIR TIDE
THAN I CAN HOLD THIS AND ITS RUN THROUGH MY FINGERS AND GONE YOU
SEE HOLDING UP HIS DRIPPING HAND

BUT FOR YOUR FACE I SHOULD THINK YOU WERE A LITTLE DESPONDENT SAID
I

NOT A BIT ON IT DEAR BOY IT COMES OF FLOWING ON SO QUIET AND OF
THAT THERE RIPPLING AT THE BOATS HEAD MAKING A SORT OF A SUNDAY TUNE
MAYBE IM A GROWING A TRIFLE OLD BESIDES

HE PUT HIS PIPE BACK IN HIS MOUTH WITH AN UNDISTURBED EXPRESSION OF
FACE AND SAT AS COMPOSED AND CONTENTED AS IF WE WERE ALREADY OUT OF
ENGLAND YET HE WAS AS SUBMISSIVE TO A WORD OF ADVICE AS IF HE HAD BEEN
IN CONSTANT TERROR FOR WHEN WE RAN ASHORE TO GET SOME BOTTLES OF BEER
INTO THE BOAT AND HE WAS STEPPING OUT I HINTED THAT I THOUGHT HE
WOULD BE SAFEST WHERE HE WAS AND HE SAID DO YOU DEAR BOY AND
QUIETLY SAT DOWN AGAIN

THE AIR FELT COLD UPON THE RIVER BUT IT WAS A BRIGHT DAY AND THE
SUNSHINE WAS VERY CHEERING THE TIDE RAN STRONG I TOOK CARE TO LOSE
NONE OF IT AND OUR STEADY STROKE CARRIED US ON THOROUGHLY WELL BY
IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES AS THE TIDE RAN OUT WE LOST MORE AND MORE OF
THE NEARER WOODS AND HILLS AND DROPPED LOWER AND LOWER BETWEEN THE
MUDDY BANKS BUT THE TIDE WAS YET WITH US WHEN WE WERE OFF GRAVESEND
AS OUR CHARGE WAS WRAPPED IN HIS CLOAK I PURPOSELY PASSED WITHIN A
BOAT OR TWOS LENGTH OF THE FLOATING CUSTOM HOUSE AND SO OUT TO CATCH
THE STREAM ALONGSIDE OF TWO EMIGRANT SHIPS AND UNDER THE BOWS OF A
LARGE TRANSPORT WITH TROOPS ON THE FORECASTLE LOOKING DOWN AT US AND
SOON THE TIDE BEGAN TO SLACKEN AND THE CRAFT LYING AT ANCHOR TO SWING
AND PRESENTLY THEY HAD ALL SWUNG ROUND AND THE SHIPS THAT WERE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW TIDE TO GET UP TO THE POOL BEGAN TO CROWD UPON US
IN A FLEET AND WE KEPT UNDER THE SHORE AS MUCH OUT OF THE STRENGTH OF
THE TIDE NOW AS WE COULD STANDING CAREFULLY OFF FROM LOW SHALLOWS AND
MUDBANKS

OUR OARSMEN WERE SO FRESH BY DINT OF HAVING OCCASIONALLY LET HER DRIVE
WITH THE TIDE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THAT A QUARTER OF AN HOURS REST
PROVED FULL AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED WE GOT ASHORE AMONG SOME SLIPPERY
STONES WHILE WE ATE AND DRANK WHAT WE HAD WITH US AND LOOKED ABOUT IT
WAS LIKE MY OWN MARSH COUNTRY FLAT AND MONOTONOUS AND WITH A DIM
HORIZON WHILE THE WINDING RIVER TURNED AND TURNED AND THE GREAT
FLOATING BUOYS UPON IT TURNED AND TURNED AND EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMED
STRANDED AND STILL FOR NOW THE LAST OF THE FLEET OF SHIPS WAS ROUND
THE LAST LOW POINT WE HAD HEADED AND THE LAST GREEN BARGE
STRAWLADEN WITH A BROWN SAIL HAD FOLLOWED AND SOME
BALLASTLIGHTERS SHAPED LIKE A CHILDS FIRST RUDE IMITATION OF A BOAT
LAY LOW IN THE MUD AND A LITTLE SQUAT SHOALLIGHTHOUSE ON OPEN PILES
STOOD CRIPPLED IN THE MUD ON STILTS AND CRUTCHES AND SLIMY STAKES
STUCK OUT OF THE MUD AND SLIMY STONES STUCK OUT OF THE MUD AND RED
LANDMARKS AND TIDEMARKS STUCK OUT OF THE MUD AND AN OLD LANDINGSTAGE
AND AN OLD ROOFLESS BUILDING SLIPPED INTO THE MUD AND ALL ABOUT US WAS
STAGNATION AND MUD

WE PUSHED OFF AGAIN AND MADE WHAT WAY WE COULD IT WAS MUCH HARDER
WORK NOW BUT HERBERT AND STARTOP PERSEVERED AND ROWED AND ROWED AND
ROWED UNTIL THE SUN WENT DOWN BY THAT TIME THE RIVER HAD LIFTED US A
LITTLE SO THAT WE COULD SEE ABOVE THE BANK THERE WAS THE RED SUN ON
THE LOW LEVEL OF THE SHORE IN A PURPLE HAZE FAST DEEPENING INTO
BLACK AND THERE WAS THE SOLITARY FLAT MARSH AND FAR AWAY THERE WERE
THE RISING GROUNDS BETWEEN WHICH AND US THERE SEEMED TO BE NO LIFE
SAVE HERE AND THERE IN THE FOREGROUND A MELANCHOLY GULL

AS THE NIGHT WAS FAST FALLING AND AS THE MOON BEING PAST THE FULL
WOULD NOT RISE EARLY WE HELD A LITTLE COUNCIL A SHORT ONE FOR
CLEARLY OUR COURSE WAS TO LIE BY AT THE FIRST LONELY TAVERN WE COULD
FIND SO THEY PLIED THEIR OARS ONCE MORE AND I LOOKED OUT FOR
ANYTHING LIKE A HOUSE THUS WE HELD ON SPEAKING LITTLE FOR FOUR OR
FIVE DULL MILES IT WAS VERY COLD AND A COLLIER COMING BY US WITH
HER GALLEYFIRE SMOKING AND FLARING LOOKED LIKE A COMFORTABLE HOME
THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK BY THIS TIME AS IT WOULD BE UNTIL MORNING AND
WHAT LIGHT WE HAD SEEMED TO COME MORE FROM THE RIVER THAN THE SKY AS
THE OARS IN THEIR DIPPING STRUCK AT A FEW REFLECTED STARS

AT THIS DISMAL TIME WE WERE EVIDENTLY ALL POSSESSED BY THE IDEA THAT WE
WERE FOLLOWED AS THE TIDE MADE IT FLAPPED HEAVILY AT IRREGULAR
INTERVALS AGAINST THE SHORE AND WHENEVER SUCH A SOUND CAME ONE OR
OTHER OF US WAS SURE TO START AND LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION HERE AND
THERE THE SET OF THE CURRENT HAD WORN DOWN THE BANK INTO A LITTLE
CREEK AND WE WERE ALL SUSPICIOUS OF SUCH PLACES AND EYED THEM
NERVOUSLY SOMETIMES WHAT WAS THAT RIPPLE ONE OF US WOULD SAY IN A
LOW VOICE OR ANOTHER IS THAT A BOAT YONDER AND AFTERWARDS WE WOULD
FALL INTO A DEAD SILENCE AND I WOULD SIT IMPATIENTLY THINKING WITH
WHAT AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF NOISE THE OARS WORKED IN THE THOWELS

AT LENGTH WE DESCRIED A LIGHT AND A ROOF AND PRESENTLY AFTERWARDS RAN
ALONGSIDE A LITTLE CAUSEWAY MADE OF STONES THAT HAD BEEN PICKED UP HARD
BY LEAVING THE REST IN THE BOAT I STEPPED ASHORE AND FOUND THE LIGHT
TO BE IN A WINDOW OF A PUBLICHOUSE IT WAS A DIRTY PLACE ENOUGH AND I
DARE SAY NOT UNKNOWN TO SMUGGLING ADVENTURERS BUT THERE WAS A GOOD
FIRE IN THE KITCHEN AND THERE WERE EGGS AND BACON TO EAT AND VARIOUS
LIQUORS TO DRINK ALSO THERE WERE TWO DOUBLEBEDDED ROOMSSUCH AS
THEY WERE THE LANDLORD SAID NO OTHER COMPANY WAS IN THE HOUSE THAN
THE LANDLORD HIS WIFE AND A GRIZZLED MALE CREATURE THE JACK OF THE
LITTLE CAUSEWAY WHO WAS AS SLIMY AND SMEARY AS IF HE HAD BEEN
LOWWATER MARK TOO

WITH THIS ASSISTANT I WENT DOWN TO THE BOAT AGAIN AND WE ALL CAME
ASHORE AND BROUGHT OUT THE OARS AND RUDDER AND BOATHOOK AND ALL
ELSE AND HAULED HER UP FOR THE NIGHT WE MADE A VERY GOOD MEAL BY THE
KITCHEN FIRE AND THEN APPORTIONED THE BEDROOMS HERBERT AND STARTOP
WERE TO OCCUPY ONE I AND OUR CHARGE THE OTHER WE FOUND THE AIR AS
CAREFULLY EXCLUDED FROM BOTH AS IF AIR WERE FATAL TO LIFE AND THERE
WERE MORE DIRTY CLOTHES AND BANDBOXES UNDER THE BEDS THAN I SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THE FAMILY POSSESSED BUT WE CONSIDERED OURSELVES WELL OFF
NOTWITHSTANDING FOR A MORE SOLITARY PLACE WE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND

WHILE WE WERE COMFORTING OURSELVES BY THE FIRE AFTER OUR MEAL THE
JACKWHO WAS SITTING IN A CORNER AND WHO HAD A BLOATED PAIR OF SHOES
ON WHICH HE HAD EXHIBITED WHILE WE WERE EATING OUR EGGS AND BACON AS
INTERESTING RELICS THAT HE HAD TAKEN A FEW DAYS AGO FROM THE FEET OF A
DROWNED SEAMAN WASHED ASHOREASKED ME IF WE HAD SEEN A FOUROARED
GALLEY GOING UP WITH THE TIDE WHEN I TOLD HIM NO HE SAID SHE MUST
HAVE GONE DOWN THEN AND YET SHE TOOK UP TOO WHEN SHE LEFT THERE

THEY MUST HA THOUGHT BETTER ONT FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER SAID
THE JACK AND GONE DOWN

A FOUROARED GALLEY DID YOU SAY SAID I

A FOUR SAID THE JACK AND TWO SITTERS

DID THEY COME ASHORE HERE

THEY PUT IN WITH A STONE TWOGALLON JAR FOR SOME BEER ID HA BEEN
GLAD TO PISON THE BEER MYSELF SAID THE JACK OR PUT SOME RATTLING
PHYSIC IN IT

WHY

I KNOW WHY SAID THE JACK HE SPOKE IN A SLUSHY VOICE AS IF MUCH
MUD HAD WASHED INTO HIS THROAT

HE THINKS SAID THE LANDLORD A WEAKLY MEDITATIVE MAN WITH A PALE
EYE WHO SEEMED TO RELY GREATLY ON HIS JACKHE THINKS THEY WAS WHAT
THEY WASNT

I KNOWS WHAT I THINKS OBSERVED THE JACK

YOU THINKS CUSTOM US JACK SAID THE LANDLORD

I DO SAID THE JACK

THEN YOURE WRONG JACK

AM I

IN THE INFINITE MEANING OF HIS REPLY AND HIS BOUNDLESS CONFIDENCE IN
HIS VIEWS THE JACK TOOK ONE OF HIS BLOATED SHOES OFF LOOKED INTO IT
KNOCKED A FEW STONES OUT OF IT ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR AND PUT IT ON
AGAIN HE DID THIS WITH THE AIR OF A JACK WHO WAS SO RIGHT THAT HE
COULD AFFORD TO DO ANYTHING

WHY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OUT THAT THEY DONE WITH THEIR BUTTONS THEN
JACK ASKED THE LANDLORD VACILLATING WEAKLY

DONE WITH THEIR BUTTONS RETURNED THE JACK CHUCKED EM OVERBOARD
SWALLERED EM SOWED EM TO COME UP SMALL SALAD DONE WITH THEIR
BUTTONS

DONT BE CHEEKY JACK REMONSTRATED THE LANDLORD IN A MELANCHOLY AND
PATHETIC WAY

A CUSTOM US OFFICER KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH HIS BUTTONS SAID THE
JACK REPEATING THE OBNOXIOUS WORD WITH THE GREATEST CONTEMPT WHEN
THEY COMES BETWIXT HIM AND HIS OWN LIGHT A FOUR AND TWO SITTERS DONT
GO HANGING AND HOVERING UP WITH ONE TIDE AND DOWN WITH ANOTHER AND
BOTH WITH AND AGAINST ANOTHER WITHOUT THERE BEING CUSTOM US AT THE
BOTTOM OF IT SAYING WHICH HE WENT OUT IN DISDAIN AND THE LANDLORD
HAVING NO ONE TO REPLY UPON FOUND IT IMPRACTICABLE TO PURSUE THE
SUBJECT

THIS DIALOGUE MADE US ALL UNEASY AND ME VERY UNEASY THE DISMAL WIND
WAS MUTTERING ROUND THE HOUSE THE TIDE WAS FLAPPING AT THE SHORE AND
I HAD A FEELING THAT WE WERE CAGED AND THREATENED A FOUROARED GALLEY
HOVERING ABOUT IN SO UNUSUAL A WAY AS TO ATTRACT THIS NOTICE WAS AN
UGLY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COULD NOT GET RID OF WHEN I HAD INDUCED
PROVIS TO GO UP TO BED I WENT OUTSIDE WITH MY TWO COMPANIONS STARTOP
BY THIS TIME KNEW THE STATE OF THE CASE AND HELD ANOTHER COUNCIL
WHETHER WE SHOULD REMAIN AT THE HOUSE UNTIL NEAR THE STEAMERS TIME
WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT ONE IN THE AFTERNOON OR WHETHER WE SHOULD PUT OFF
EARLY IN THE MORNING WAS THE QUESTION WE DISCUSSED ON THE WHOLE WE
DEEMED IT THE BETTER COURSE TO LIE WHERE WE WERE UNTIL WITHIN AN HOUR
OR SO OF THE STEAMERS TIME AND THEN TO GET OUT IN HER TRACK AND
DRIFT EASILY WITH THE TIDE HAVING SETTLED TO DO THIS WE RETURNED INTO
THE HOUSE AND WENT TO BED

I LAY DOWN WITH THE GREATER PART OF MY CLOTHES ON AND SLEPT WELL FOR A
FEW HOURS WHEN I AWOKE THE WIND HAD RISEN AND THE SIGN OF THE HOUSE
THE SHIP WAS CREAKING AND BANGING ABOUT WITH NOISES THAT STARTLED
ME RISING SOFTLY FOR MY CHARGE LAY FAST ASLEEP I LOOKED OUT OF THE
WINDOW IT COMMANDED THE CAUSEWAY WHERE WE HAD HAULED UP OUR BOAT AND
AS MY EYES ADAPTED THEMSELVES TO THE LIGHT OF THE CLOUDED MOON I SAW
TWO MEN LOOKING INTO HER THEY PASSED BY UNDER THE WINDOW LOOKING AT
NOTHING ELSE AND THEY DID NOT GO DOWN TO THE LANDINGPLACE WHICH I
COULD DISCERN TO BE EMPTY BUT STRUCK ACROSS THE MARSH IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE NORE

MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO CALL UP HERBERT AND SHOW HIM THE TWO MEN GOING
AWAY BUT REFLECTING BEFORE I GOT INTO HIS ROOM WHICH WAS AT THE BACK
OF THE HOUSE AND ADJOINED MINE THAT HE AND STARTOP HAD HAD A HARDER
DAY THAN I AND WERE FATIGUED I FORBORE GOING BACK TO MY WINDOW I
COULD SEE THE TWO MEN MOVING OVER THE MARSH IN THAT LIGHT HOWEVER I
SOON LOST THEM AND FEELING VERY COLD LAY DOWN TO THINK OF THE
MATTER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN

WE WERE UP EARLY AS WE WALKED TO AND FRO ALL FOUR TOGETHER BEFORE
BREAKFAST I DEEMED IT RIGHT TO RECOUNT WHAT I HAD SEEN AGAIN OUR
CHARGE WAS THE LEAST ANXIOUS OF THE PARTY IT WAS VERY LIKELY THAT THE
MEN BELONGED TO THE CUSTOM HOUSE HE SAID QUIETLY AND THAT THEY HAD NO
THOUGHT OF US I TRIED TO PERSUADE MYSELF THAT IT WAS SOAS INDEED
IT MIGHT EASILY BE HOWEVER I PROPOSED THAT HE AND I SHOULD WALK AWAY
TOGETHER TO A DISTANT POINT WE COULD SEE AND THAT THE BOAT SHOULD TAKE
US ABOARD THERE OR AS NEAR THERE AS MIGHT PROVE FEASIBLE AT ABOUT
NOON THIS BEING CONSIDERED A GOOD PRECAUTION SOON AFTER BREAKFAST HE
AND I SET FORTH WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING AT THE TAVERN

HE SMOKED HIS PIPE AS WE WENT ALONG AND SOMETIMES STOPPED TO CLAP ME
ON THE SHOULDER ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS IN
DANGER NOT HE AND THAT HE WAS REASSURING ME WE SPOKE VERY LITTLE AS
WE APPROACHED THE POINT I BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN IN A SHELTERED PLACE
WHILE I WENT ON TO RECONNOITRE FOR IT WAS TOWARDS IT THAT THE MEN HAD
PASSED IN THE NIGHT HE COMPLIED AND I WENT ON ALONE THERE WAS NO
BOAT OFF THE POINT NOR ANY BOAT DRAWN UP ANYWHERE NEAR IT NOR WERE
THERE ANY SIGNS OF THE MEN HAVING EMBARKED THERE BUT TO BE SURE THE
TIDE WAS HIGH AND THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME FOOTPRINTS UNDER WATER

WHEN HE LOOKED OUT FROM HIS SHELTER IN THE DISTANCE AND SAW THAT I
WAVED MY HAT TO HIM TO COME UP HE REJOINED ME AND THERE WE WAITED
SOMETIMES LYING ON THE BANK WRAPPED IN OUR COATS AND SOMETIMES MOVING
ABOUT TO WARM OURSELVES UNTIL WE SAW OUR BOAT COMING ROUND WE GOT
ABOARD EASILY AND ROWED OUT INTO THE TRACK OF THE STEAMER BY THAT
TIME IT WANTED BUT TEN MINUTES OF ONE OCLOCK AND WE BEGAN TO LOOK OUT
FOR HER SMOKE

BUT IT WAS HALFPAST ONE BEFORE WE SAW HER SMOKE AND SOON AFTERWARDS
WE SAW BEHIND IT THE SMOKE OF ANOTHER STEAMER AS THEY WERE COMING ON
AT FULL SPEED WE GOT THE TWO BAGS READY AND TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY OF
SAYING GOODBYE TO HERBERT AND STARTOP WE HAD ALL SHAKEN HANDS
CORDIALLY AND NEITHER HERBERTS EYES NOR MINE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN I
SAW A FOUROARED GALLEY SHOOT OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK BUT A LITTLE WAY
AHEAD OF US AND ROW OUT INTO THE SAME TRACK

A STRETCH OF SHORE HAD BEEN AS YET BETWEEN US AND THE STEAMERS SMOKE
BY REASON OF THE BEND AND WIND OF THE RIVER BUT NOW SHE WAS VISIBLE
COMING HEAD ON I CALLED TO HERBERT AND STARTOP TO KEEP BEFORE THE
TIDE THAT SHE MIGHT SEE US LYING BY FOR HER AND I ADJURED PROVIS TO
SIT QUITE STILL WRAPPED IN HIS CLOAK HE ANSWERED CHEERILY TRUST TO
ME DEAR BOY AND SAT LIKE A STATUE MEANTIME THE GALLEY WHICH WAS
VERY SKILFULLY HANDLED HAD CROSSED US LET US COME UP WITH HER AND
FALLEN ALONGSIDE LEAVING JUST ROOM ENOUGH FOR THE PLAY OF THE OARS
SHE KEPT ALONGSIDE DRIFTING WHEN WE DRIFTED AND PULLING A STROKE OR
TWO WHEN WE PULLED OF THE TWO SITTERS ONE HELD THE RUDDERLINES AND
LOOKED AT US ATTENTIVELYAS DID ALL THE ROWERS THE OTHER SITTER WAS
WRAPPED UP MUCH AS PROVIS WAS AND SEEMED TO SHRINK AND WHISPER SOME
INSTRUCTION TO THE STEERER AS HE LOOKED AT US NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN IN
EITHER BOAT

STARTOP COULD MAKE OUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES WHICH STEAMER WAS FIRST
AND GAVE ME THE WORD HAMBURG IN A LOW VOICE AS WE SAT FACE TO FACE
SHE WAS NEARING US VERY FAST AND THE BEATING OF HER PEDDLES GREW
LOUDER AND LOUDER I FELT AS IF HER SHADOW WERE ABSOLUTELY UPON US
WHEN THE GALLEY HAILED US I ANSWERED

YOU HAVE A RETURNED TRANSPORT THERE SAID THE MAN WHO HELD THE LINES
THATS THE MAN WRAPPED IN THE CLOAK HIS NAME IS ABEL MAGWITCH
OTHERWISE PROVIS I APPREHEND THAT MAN AND CALL UPON HIM TO SURRENDER
AND YOU TO ASSIST

AT THE SAME MOMENT WITHOUT GIVING ANY AUDIBLE DIRECTION TO HIS CREW
HE RAN THE GALLEY ABROAD OF US THEY HAD PULLED ONE SUDDEN STROKE
AHEAD HAD GOT THEIR OARS IN HAD RUN ATHWART US AND WERE HOLDING ON
TO OUR GUNWALE BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THIS CAUSED GREAT
CONFUSION ON BOARD THE STEAMER AND I HEARD THEM CALLING TO US AND
HEARD THE ORDER GIVEN TO STOP THE PADDLES AND HEARD THEM STOP BUT
FELT HER DRIVING DOWN UPON US IRRESISTIBLY IN THE SAME MOMENT I SAW
THE STEERSMAN OF THE GALLEY LAY HIS HAND ON HIS PRISONERS SHOULDER
AND SAW THAT BOTH BOATS WERE SWINGING ROUND WITH THE FORCE OF THE TIDE
AND SAW THAT ALL HANDS ON BOARD THE STEAMER WERE RUNNING FORWARD QUITE
FRANTICALLY STILL IN THE SAME MOMENT I SAW THE PRISONER START UP
LEAN ACROSS HIS CAPTOR AND PULL THE CLOAK FROM THE NECK OF THE
SHRINKING SITTER IN THE GALLEY STILL IN THE SAME MOMENT I SAW THAT
THE FACE DISCLOSED WAS THE FACE OF THE OTHER CONVICT OF LONG AGO
STILL IN THE SAME MOMENT I SAW THE FACE TILT BACKWARD WITH A WHITE
TERROR ON IT THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET AND HEARD A GREAT CRY ON BOARD
THE STEAMER AND A LOUD SPLASH IN THE WATER AND FELT THE BOAT SINK
FROM UNDER ME

IT WAS BUT FOR AN INSTANT THAT I SEEMED TO STRUGGLE WITH A THOUSAND
MILLWEIRS AND A THOUSAND FLASHES OF LIGHT THAT INSTANT PAST I WAS
TAKEN ON BOARD THE GALLEY HERBERT WAS THERE AND STARTOP WAS THERE
BUT OUR BOAT WAS GONE AND THE TWO CONVICTS WERE GONE

WHAT WITH THE CRIES ABOARD THE STEAMER AND THE FURIOUS BLOWING OFF OF
HER STEAM AND HER DRIVING ON AND OUR DRIVING ON I COULD NOT AT FIRST
DISTINGUISH SKY FROM WATER OR SHORE FROM SHORE BUT THE CREW OF THE
GALLEY RIGHTED HER WITH GREAT SPEED AND PULLING CERTAIN SWIFT STRONG
STROKES AHEAD LAY UPON THEIR OARS EVERY MAN LOOKING SILENTLY AND
EAGERLY AT THE WATER ASTERN PRESENTLY A DARK OBJECT WAS SEEN IN IT
BEARING TOWARDS US ON THE TIDE NO MAN SPOKE BUT THE STEERSMAN HELD UP
HIS HAND AND ALL SOFTLY BACKED WATER AND KEPT THE BOAT STRAIGHT AND
TRUE BEFORE IT AS IT CAME NEARER I SAW IT TO BE MAGWITCH SWIMMING
BUT NOT SWIMMING FREELY HE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD AND INSTANTLY MANACLED
AT THE WRISTS AND ANKLES

THE GALLEY WAS KEPT STEADY AND THE SILENT EAGER LOOKOUT AT THE WATER
WAS RESUMED BUT THE ROTTERDAM STEAMER NOW CAME UP AND APPARENTLY NOT
UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAD HAPPENED CAME ON AT SPEED BY THE TIME SHE HAD
BEEN HAILED AND STOPPED BOTH STEAMERS WERE DRIFTING AWAY FROM US AND
WE WERE RISING AND FALLING IN A TROUBLED WAKE OF WATER THE LOOKOUT
WAS KEPT LONG AFTER ALL WAS STILL AGAIN AND THE TWO STEAMERS WERE
GONE BUT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT IT WAS HOPELESS NOW

AT LENGTH WE GAVE IT UP AND PULLED UNDER THE SHORE TOWARDS THE TAVERN
WE HAD LATELY LEFT WHERE WE WERE RECEIVED WITH NO LITTLE SURPRISE
HERE I WAS ABLE TO GET SOME COMFORTS FOR MAGWITCHPROVIS NO
LONGERWHO HAD RECEIVED SOME VERY SEVERE INJURY IN THE CHEST AND A
DEEP CUT IN THE HEAD

HE TOLD ME THAT HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO HAVE GONE UNDER THE KEEL OF THE
STEAMER AND TO HAVE BEEN STRUCK ON THE HEAD IN RISING THE INJURY TO
HIS CHEST WHICH RENDERED HIS BREATHING EXTREMELY PAINFUL HE THOUGHT
HE HAD RECEIVED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE GALLEY HE ADDED THAT HE DID
NOT PRETEND TO SAY WHAT HE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE TO COMPEYSON
BUT THAT IN THE MOMENT OF HIS LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS CLOAK TO IDENTIFY
HIM THAT VILLAIN HAD STAGGERED UP AND STAGGERED BACK AND THEY HAD
BOTH GONE OVERBOARD TOGETHER WHEN THE SUDDEN WRENCHING OF HIM
MAGWITCH OUT OF OUR BOAT AND THE ENDEAVOUR OF HIS CAPTOR TO KEEP HIM
IN IT HAD CAPSIZED US HE TOLD ME IN A WHISPER THAT THEY HAD GONE DOWN
FIERCELY LOCKED IN EACH OTHERS ARMS AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A
STRUGGLE UNDER WATER AND THAT HE HAD DISENGAGED HIMSELF STRUCK OUT
AND SWUM AWAY

I NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO DOUBT THE EXACT TRUTH OF WHAT HE THUS TOLD
ME THE OFFICER WHO STEERED THE GALLEY GAVE THE SAME ACCOUNT OF THEIR
GOING OVERBOARD

WHEN I ASKED THIS OFFICERS PERMISSION TO CHANGE THE PRISONERS WET
CLOTHES BY PURCHASING ANY SPARE GARMENTS I COULD GET AT THE
PUBLICHOUSE HE GAVE IT READILY MERELY OBSERVING THAT HE MUST TAKE
CHARGE OF EVERYTHING HIS PRISONER HAD ABOUT HIM SO THE POCKETBOOK
WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN IN MY HANDS PASSED INTO THE OFFICERS HE FURTHER
GAVE ME LEAVE TO ACCOMPANY THE PRISONER TO LONDON BUT DECLINED TO
ACCORD THAT GRACE TO MY TWO FRIENDS

THE JACK AT THE SHIP WAS INSTRUCTED WHERE THE DROWNED MAN HAD GONE
DOWN AND UNDERTOOK TO SEARCH FOR THE BODY IN THE PLACES WHERE IT WAS
LIKELIEST TO COME ASHORE HIS INTEREST IN ITS RECOVERY SEEMED TO ME TO
BE MUCH HEIGHTENED WHEN HE HEARD THAT IT HAD STOCKINGS ON PROBABLY IT
TOOK ABOUT A DOZEN DROWNED MEN TO FIT HIM OUT COMPLETELY AND THAT MAY
HAVE BEEN THE REASON WHY THE DIFFERENT ARTICLES OF HIS DRESS WERE IN
VARIOUS STAGES OF DECAY

WE REMAINED AT THE PUBLICHOUSE UNTIL THE TIDE TURNED AND THEN
MAGWITCH WAS CARRIED DOWN TO THE GALLEY AND PUT ON BOARD HERBERT AND
STARTOP WERE TO GET TO LONDON BY LAND AS SOON AS THEY COULD WE HAD A
DOLEFUL PARTING AND WHEN I TOOK MY PLACE BY MAGWITCHS SIDE I FELT
THAT THAT WAS MY PLACE HENCEFORTH WHILE HE LIVED

FOR NOW MY REPUGNANCE TO HIM HAD ALL MELTED AWAY AND IN THE HUNTED
WOUNDED SHACKLED CREATURE WHO HELD MY HAND IN HIS I ONLY SAW A MAN
WHO HAD MEANT TO BE MY BENEFACTOR AND WHO HAD FELT AFFECTIONATELY
GRATEFULLY AND GENEROUSLY TOWARDS ME WITH GREAT CONSTANCY THROUGH A
SERIES OF YEARS I ONLY SAW IN HIM A MUCH BETTER MAN THAN I HAD BEEN TO
JOE

HIS BREATHING BECAME MORE DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL AS THE NIGHT DREW ON
AND OFTEN HE COULD NOT REPRESS A GROAN I TRIED TO REST HIM ON THE ARM
I COULD USE IN ANY EASY POSITION BUT IT WAS DREADFUL TO THINK THAT I
COULD NOT BE SORRY AT HEART FOR HIS BEING BADLY HURT SINCE IT WAS
UNQUESTIONABLY BEST THAT HE SHOULD DIE THAT THERE WERE STILL LIVING
PEOPLE ENOUGH WHO WERE ABLE AND WILLING TO IDENTIFY HIM I COULD NOT
DOUBT THAT HE WOULD BE LENIENTLY TREATED I COULD NOT HOPE HE WHO HAD
BEEN PRESENTED IN THE WORST LIGHT AT HIS TRIAL WHO HAD SINCE BROKEN
PRISON AND HAD BEEN TRIED AGAIN WHO HAD RETURNED FROM TRANSPORTATION
UNDER A LIFE SENTENCE AND WHO HAD OCCASIONED THE DEATH OF THE MAN WHO
WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS ARREST

AS WE RETURNED TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN WE HAD YESTERDAY LEFT BEHIND US
AND AS THE STREAM OF OUR HOPES SEEMED ALL RUNNING BACK I TOLD HIM HOW
GRIEVED I WAS TO THINK THAT HE HAD COME HOME FOR MY SAKE

DEAR BOY HE ANSWERED IM QUITE CONTENT TO TAKE MY CHANCE IVE
SEEN MY BOY AND HE CAN BE A GENTLEMAN WITHOUT ME

NO I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WHILE WE HAD BEEN THERE SIDE BY SIDE NO
APART FROM ANY INCLINATIONS OF MY OWN I UNDERSTOOD WEMMICKS HINT NOW
I FORESAW THAT BEING CONVICTED HIS POSSESSIONS WOULD BE FORFEITED TO
THE CROWN

LOOKEE HERE DEAR BOY SAID HE ITS BEST AS A GENTLEMAN SHOULD NOT
BE KNOWED TO BELONG TO ME NOW ONLY COME TO SEE ME AS IF YOU COME BY
CHANCE ALONGER WEMMICK SIT WHERE I CAN SEE YOU WHEN I AM SWORE TO FOR
THE LAST O MANY TIMES AND I DONT ASK NO MORE

I WILL NEVER STIR FROM YOUR SIDE SAID I WHEN I AM SUFFERED TO BE
NEAR YOU PLEASE GOD I WILL BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN TO ME

I FELT HIS HAND TREMBLE AS IT HELD MINE AND HE TURNED HIS FACE AWAY AS
HE LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND I HEARD THAT OLD SOUND IN HIS
THROATSOFTENED NOW LIKE ALL THE REST OF HIM IT WAS A GOOD THING
THAT HE HAD TOUCHED THIS POINT FOR IT PUT INTO MY MIND WHAT I MIGHT
NOT OTHERWISE HAVE THOUGHT OF UNTIL TOO LATETHAT HE NEED NEVER KNOW
HOW HIS HOPES OF ENRICHING ME HAD PERISHED




CHAPTER LV


HE WAS TAKEN TO THE POLICE COURT NEXT DAY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMMEDIATELY COMMITTED FOR TRIAL BUT THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEND DOWN
FOR AN OLD OFFICER OF THE PRISONSHIP FROM WHICH HE HAD ONCE ESCAPED
TO SPEAK TO HIS IDENTITY NOBODY DOUBTED IT BUT COMPEYSON WHO HAD
MEANT TO DEPOSE TO IT WAS TUMBLING ON THE TIDES DEAD AND IT HAPPENED
THAT THERE WAS NOT AT THAT TIME ANY PRISON OFFICER IN LONDON WHO COULD
GIVE THE REQUIRED EVIDENCE I HAD GONE DIRECT TO MR JAGGERS AT HIS
PRIVATE HOUSE ON MY ARRIVAL OVER NIGHT TO RETAIN HIS ASSISTANCE AND
MR JAGGERS ON THE PRISONERS BEHALF WOULD ADMIT NOTHING IT WAS THE
SOLE RESOURCE FOR HE TOLD ME THAT THE CASE MUST BE OVER IN FIVE
MINUTES WHEN THE WITNESS WAS THERE AND THAT NO POWER ON EARTH COULD
PREVENT ITS GOING AGAINST US

I IMPARTED TO MR JAGGERS MY DESIGN OF KEEPING HIM IN IGNORANCE OF THE
FATE OF HIS WEALTH MR JAGGERS WAS QUERULOUS AND ANGRY WITH ME FOR
HAVING LET IT SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS AND SAID WE MUST MEMORIALISE
BY AND BY AND TRY AT ALL EVENTS FOR SOME OF IT BUT HE DID NOT CONCEAL
FROM ME THAT ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT BE MANY CASES IN WHICH THE
FORFEITURE WOULD NOT BE EXACTED THERE WERE NO CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS
CASE TO MAKE IT ONE OF THEM I UNDERSTOOD THAT VERY WELL I WAS NOT
RELATED TO THE OUTLAW OR CONNECTED WITH HIM BY ANY RECOGNISABLE TIE
HE HAD PUT HIS HAND TO NO WRITING OR SETTLEMENT IN MY FAVOUR BEFORE HIS
APPREHENSION AND TO DO SO NOW WOULD BE IDLE I HAD NO CLAIM AND I
FINALLY RESOLVED AND EVER AFTERWARDS ABIDED BY THE RESOLUTION THAT MY
HEART SHOULD NEVER BE SICKENED WITH THE HOPELESS TASK OF ATTEMPTING TO
ESTABLISH ONE

THERE APPEARED TO BE REASON FOR SUPPOSING THAT THE DROWNED INFORMER HAD
HOPED FOR A REWARD OUT OF THIS FORFEITURE AND HAD OBTAINED SOME
ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF MAGWITCHS AFFAIRS WHEN HIS BODY WAS FOUND MANY
MILES FROM THE SCENE OF HIS DEATH AND SO HORRIBLY DISFIGURED THAT HE
WAS ONLY RECOGNISABLE BY THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS NOTES WERE STILL
LEGIBLE FOLDED IN A CASE HE CARRIED AMONG THESE WERE THE NAME OF A
BANKINGHOUSE IN NEW SOUTH WALES WHERE A SUM OF MONEY WAS AND THE
DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN LANDS OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE BOTH THESE HEADS OF
INFORMATION WERE IN A LIST THAT MAGWITCH WHILE IN PRISON GAVE TO MR
JAGGERS OF THE POSSESSIONS HE SUPPOSED I SHOULD INHERIT HIS
IGNORANCE POOR FELLOW AT LAST SERVED HIM HE NEVER MISTRUSTED BUT
THAT MY INHERITANCE WAS QUITE SAFE WITH MR JAGGERSS AID

AFTER THREE DAYS DELAY DURING WHICH THE CROWN PROSECUTION STOOD OVER
FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE WITNESS FROM THE PRISONSHIP THE WITNESS
CAME AND COMPLETED THE EASY CASE HE WAS COMMITTED TO TAKE HIS TRIAL
AT THE NEXT SESSIONS WHICH WOULD COME ON IN A MONTH

IT WAS AT THIS DARK TIME OF MY LIFE THAT HERBERT RETURNED HOME ONE
EVENING A GOOD DEAL CAST DOWN AND SAID

MY DEAR HANDEL I FEAR I SHALL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE YOU

HIS PARTNER HAVING PREPARED ME FOR THAT I WAS LESS SURPRISED THAN HE
THOUGHT

WE SHALL LOSE A FINE OPPORTUNITY IF I PUT OFF GOING TO CAIRO AND I AM
VERY MUCH AFRAID I MUST GO HANDEL WHEN YOU MOST NEED ME

HERBERT I SHALL ALWAYS NEED YOU BECAUSE I SHALL ALWAYS LOVE YOU BUT
MY NEED IS NO GREATER NOW THAN AT ANOTHER TIME

YOU WILL BE SO LONELY

I HAVE NOT LEISURE TO THINK OF THAT SAID I YOU KNOW THAT I AM
ALWAYS WITH HIM TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE TIME ALLOWED AND THAT I
SHOULD BE WITH HIM ALL DAY LONG IF I COULD AND WHEN I COME AWAY FROM
HIM YOU KNOW THAT MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH HIM

THE DREADFUL CONDITION TO WHICH HE WAS BROUGHT WAS SO APPALLING TO
BOTH OF US THAT WE COULD NOT REFER TO IT IN PLAINER WORDS

MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HERBERT LET THE NEAR PROSPECT OF OUR
SEPARATIONFOR IT IS VERY NEARBE MY JUSTIFICATION FOR TROUBLING YOU
ABOUT YOURSELF HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF YOUR FUTURE

NO FOR I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO THINK OF ANY FUTURE

BUT YOURS CANNOT BE DISMISSED INDEED MY DEAR DEAR HANDEL IT MUST
NOT BE DISMISSED I WISH YOU WOULD ENTER ON IT NOW AS FAR AS A FEW
FRIENDLY WORDS GO WITH ME

I WILL SAID I

IN THIS BRANCH HOUSE OF OURS HANDEL WE MUST HAVE A

I SAW THAT HIS DELICACY WAS AVOIDING THE RIGHT WORD SO I SAID A
CLERK

A CLERK AND I HOPE IT IS NOT AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT HE MAY EXPAND AS A
CLERK OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE HAS EXPANDED INTO A PARTNER NOW
HANDELIN SHORT MY DEAR BOY WILL YOU COME TO ME

THERE WAS SOMETHING CHARMINGLY CORDIAL AND ENGAGING IN THE MANNER IN
WHICH AFTER SAYING NOW HANDEL AS IF IT WERE THE GRAVE BEGINNING OF
A PORTENTOUS BUSINESS EXORDIUM HE HAD SUDDENLY GIVEN UP THAT TONE
STRETCHED OUT HIS HONEST HAND AND SPOKEN LIKE A SCHOOLBOY

CLARA AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN HERBERT PURSUED
AND THE DEAR LITTLE THING BEGGED ME ONLY THIS EVENING WITH TEARS IN
HER EYES TO SAY TO YOU THAT IF YOU WILL LIVE WITH US WHEN WE COME
TOGETHER SHE WILL DO HER BEST TO MAKE YOU HAPPY AND TO CONVINCE HER
HUSBANDS FRIEND THAT HE IS HER FRIEND TOO WE SHOULD GET ON SO WELL
HANDEL

I THANKED HER HEARTILY AND I THANKED HIM HEARTILY BUT SAID I COULD
NOT YET MAKE SURE OF JOINING HIM AS HE SO KINDLY OFFERED FIRSTLY MY
MIND WAS TOO PREOCCUPIED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IN THE SUBJECT CLEARLY
SECONDLYYES SECONDLY THERE WAS A VAGUE SOMETHING LINGERING IN MY
THOUGHTS THAT WILL COME OUT VERY NEAR THE END OF THIS SLIGHT NARRATIVE

BUT IF YOU THOUGHT HERBERT THAT YOU COULD WITHOUT DOING ANY INJURY
TO YOUR BUSINESS LEAVE THE QUESTION OPEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE

FOR ANY WHILE CRIED HERBERT SIX MONTHS A YEAR

NOT SO LONG AS THAT SAID I TWO OR THREE MONTHS AT MOST

HERBERT WAS HIGHLY DELIGHTED WHEN WE SHOOK HANDS ON THIS ARRANGEMENT
AND SAID HE COULD NOW TAKE COURAGE TO TELL ME THAT HE BELIEVED HE MUST
GO AWAY AT THE END OF THE WEEK

AND CLARA SAID I

THE DEAR LITTLE THING RETURNED HERBERT HOLDS DUTIFULLY TO HER
FATHER AS LONG AS HE LASTS BUT HE WONT LAST LONG MRS WHIMPLE
CONFIDES TO ME THAT HE IS CERTAINLY GOING

NOT TO SAY AN UNFEELING THING SAID I HE CANNOT DO BETTER THAN GO

I AM AFRAID THAT MUST BE ADMITTED SAID HERBERT AND THEN I SHALL
COME BACK FOR THE DEAR LITTLE THING AND THE DEAR LITTLE THING AND I
WILL WALK QUIETLY INTO THE NEAREST CHURCH REMEMBER THE BLESSED
DARLING COMES OF NO FAMILY MY DEAR HANDEL AND NEVER LOOKED INTO THE
RED BOOK AND HASNT A NOTION ABOUT HER GRANDPAPA WHAT A FORTUNE FOR
THE SON OF MY MOTHER

ON THE SATURDAY IN THAT SAME WEEK I TOOK MY LEAVE OF HERBERTFULL OF
BRIGHT HOPE BUT SAD AND SORRY TO LEAVE MEAS HE SAT ON ONE OF THE
SEAPORT MAIL COACHES I WENT INTO A COFFEEHOUSE TO WRITE A LITTLE NOTE
TO CLARA TELLING HER HE HAD GONE OFF SENDING HIS LOVE TO HER OVER AND
OVER AGAIN AND THEN WENT TO MY LONELY HOMEIF IT DESERVED THE NAME
FOR IT WAS NOW NO HOME TO ME AND I HAD NO HOME ANYWHERE

ON THE STAIRS I ENCOUNTERED WEMMICK WHO WAS COMING DOWN AFTER AN
UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF HIS KNUCKLES TO MY DOOR I HAD NOT SEEN HIM
ALONE SINCE THE DISASTROUS ISSUE OF THE ATTEMPTED FLIGHT AND HE HAD
COME IN HIS PRIVATE AND PERSONAL CAPACITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF
EXPLANATION IN REFERENCE TO THAT FAILURE

THE LATE COMPEYSON SAID WEMMICK HAD BY LITTLE AND LITTLE GOT AT
THE BOTTOM OF HALF OF THE REGULAR BUSINESS NOW TRANSACTED AND IT WAS
FROM THE TALK OF SOME OF HIS PEOPLE IN TROUBLE SOME OF HIS PEOPLE
BEING ALWAYS IN TROUBLE THAT I HEARD WHAT I DID I KEPT MY EARS OPEN
SEEMING TO HAVE THEM SHUT UNTIL I HEARD THAT HE WAS ABSENT AND I
THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE BEST TIME FOR MAKING THE ATTEMPT I CAN ONLY
SUPPOSE NOW THAT IT WAS A PART OF HIS POLICY AS A VERY CLEVER MAN
HABITUALLY TO DECEIVE HIS OWN INSTRUMENTS YOU DONT BLAME ME I HOPE
MR PIP I AM SURE I TRIED TO SERVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART

I AM AS SURE OF THAT WEMMICK AS YOU CAN BE AND I THANK YOU MOST
EARNESTLY FOR ALL YOUR INTEREST AND FRIENDSHIP

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ITS A BAD JOB SAID WEMMICK
SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AND I ASSURE YOU I HAVENT BEEN SO CUT UP FOR A
LONG TIME WHAT I LOOK AT IS THE SACRIFICE OF SO MUCH PORTABLE
PROPERTY DEAR ME

WHAT I THINK OF WEMMICK IS THE POOR OWNER OF THE PROPERTY

YES TO BE SURE SAID WEMMICK OF COURSE THERE CAN BE NO OBJECTION
TO YOUR BEING SORRY FOR HIM AND ID PUT DOWN A FIVEPOUND NOTE MYSELF
TO GET HIM OUT OF IT BUT WHAT I LOOK AT IS THIS THE LATE COMPEYSON
HAVING BEEN BEFOREHAND WITH HIM IN INTELLIGENCE OF HIS RETURN AND
BEING SO DETERMINED TO BRING HIM TO BOOK I DO NOT THINK HE COULD HAVE
BEEN SAVED WHEREAS THE PORTABLE PROPERTY CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN
SAVED THATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY AND THE OWNER DONT
YOU SEE

I INVITED WEMMICK TO COME UPSTAIRS AND REFRESH HIMSELF WITH A GLASS OF
GROG BEFORE WALKING TO WALWORTH HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHILE HE
WAS DRINKING HIS MODERATE ALLOWANCE HE SAID WITH NOTHING TO LEAD UP
TO IT AND AFTER HAVING APPEARED RATHER FIDGETY

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY MEANING TO TAKE A HOLIDAY ON MONDAY MR PIP

WHY I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOT DONE SUCH A THING THESE TWELVE MONTHS

THESE TWELVE YEARS MORE LIKELY SAID WEMMICK YES IM GOING TO
TAKE A HOLIDAY MORE THAN THAT IM GOING TO TAKE A WALK MORE THAN
THAT IM GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE A WALK WITH ME

I WAS ABOUT TO EXCUSE MYSELF AS BEING BUT A BAD COMPANION JUST THEN
WHEN WEMMICK ANTICIPATED ME

I KNOW YOUR ENGAGEMENTS SAID HE AND I KNOW YOU ARE OUT OF SORTS
MR PIP BUT IF YOU COULD OBLIGE ME I SHOULD TAKE IT AS A KINDNESS
IT AINT A LONG WALK AND ITS AN EARLY ONE SAY IT MIGHT OCCUPY YOU
INCLUDING BREAKFAST ON THE WALK FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE COULDNT YOU
STRETCH A POINT AND MANAGE IT

HE HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR ME AT VARIOUS TIMES THAT THIS WAS VERY LITTLE
TO DO FOR HIM I SAID I COULD MANAGE ITWOULD MANAGE ITAND HE WAS SO
VERY MUCH PLEASED BY MY ACQUIESCENCE THAT I WAS PLEASED TOO AT HIS
PARTICULAR REQUEST I APPOINTED TO CALL FOR HIM AT THE CASTLE AT HALF
PAST EIGHT ON MONDAY MORNING AND SO WE PARTED FOR THE TIME

PUNCTUAL TO MY APPOINTMENT I RANG AT THE CASTLE GATE ON THE MONDAY
MORNING AND WAS RECEIVED BY WEMMICK HIMSELF WHO STRUCK ME AS LOOKING
TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HAVING A SLEEKER HAT ON WITHIN THERE WERE TWO
GLASSES OF RUM AND MILK PREPARED AND TWO BISCUITS THE AGED MUST HAVE
BEEN STIRRING WITH THE LARK FOR GLANCING INTO THE PERSPECTIVE OF HIS
BEDROOM I OBSERVED THAT HIS BED WAS EMPTY

WHEN WE HAD FORTIFIED OURSELVES WITH THE RUM AND MILK AND BISCUITS AND
WERE GOING OUT FOR THE WALK WITH THAT TRAINING PREPARATION ON US I WAS
CONSIDERABLY SURPRISED TO SEE WEMMICK TAKE UP A FISHINGROD AND PUT IT
OVER HIS SHOULDER WHY WE ARE NOT GOING FISHING SAID I NO
RETURNED WEMMICK BUT I LIKE TO WALK WITH ONE

I THOUGHT THIS ODD HOWEVER I SAID NOTHING AND WE SET OFF WE WENT
TOWARDS CAMBERWELL GREEN AND WHEN WE WERE THEREABOUTS WEMMICK SAID
SUDDENLY

HALLOA HERES A CHURCH

THERE WAS NOTHING VERY SURPRISING IN THAT BUT AGAIN I WAS RATHER
SURPRISED WHEN HE SAID AS IF HE WERE ANIMATED BY A BRILLIANT IDEA

LETS GO IN

WE WENT IN WEMMICK LEAVING HIS FISHINGROD IN THE PORCH AND LOOKED
ALL ROUND IN THE MEAN TIME WEMMICK WAS DIVING INTO HIS COATPOCKETS
AND GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF PAPER THERE

HALLOA SAID HE HERES A COUPLE OF PAIR OF GLOVES LETS PUT EM
ON

AS THE GLOVES WERE WHITE KID GLOVES AND AS THE POSTOFFICE WAS WIDENED
TO ITS UTMOST EXTENT I NOW BEGAN TO HAVE MY STRONG SUSPICIONS THEY
WERE STRENGTHENED INTO CERTAINTY WHEN I BEHELD THE AGED ENTER AT A SIDE
DOOR ESCORTING A LADY

HALLOA SAID WEMMICK HERES MISS SKIFFINS LETS HAVE A WEDDING

THAT DISCREET DAMSEL WAS ATTIRED AS USUAL EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS NOW
ENGAGED IN SUBSTITUTING FOR HER GREEN KID GLOVES A PAIR OF WHITE THE
AGED WAS LIKEWISE OCCUPIED IN PREPARING A SIMILAR SACRIFICE FOR THE
ALTAR OF HYMEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN HOWEVER EXPERIENCED SO MUCH
DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HIS GLOVES ON THAT WEMMICK FOUND IT NECESSARY TO
PUT HIM WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A PILLAR AND THEN TO GET BEHIND THE
PILLAR HIMSELF AND PULL AWAY AT THEM WHILE I FOR MY PART HELD THE OLD
GENTLEMAN ROUND THE WAIST THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT AN EQUAL AND SAFE
RESISTANCE BY DINT OF THIS INGENIOUS SCHEME HIS GLOVES WERE GOT ON TO
PERFECTION

THE CLERK AND CLERGYMAN THEN APPEARING WE WERE RANGED IN ORDER AT
THOSE FATAL RAILS TRUE TO HIS NOTION OF SEEMING TO DO IT ALL WITHOUT
PREPARATION I HEARD WEMMICK SAY TO HIMSELF AS HE TOOK SOMETHING OUT
OF HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET BEFORE THE SERVICE BEGAN HALLOA HERES A
RING

I ACTED IN THE CAPACITY OF BACKER OR BESTMAN TO THE BRIDEGROOM
WHILE A LITTLE LIMP PEWOPENER IN A SOFT BONNET LIKE A BABYS MADE A
FEINT OF BEING THE BOSOM FRIEND OF MISS SKIFFINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
GIVING THE LADY AWAY DEVOLVED UPON THE AGED WHICH LED TO THE
CLERGYMANS BEING UNINTENTIONALLY SCANDALISED AND IT HAPPENED THUS
WHEN HE SAID WHO GIVETH THIS WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO THIS MAN THE
OLD GENTLEMAN NOT IN THE LEAST KNOWING WHAT POINT OF THE CEREMONY WE
HAD ARRIVED AT STOOD MOST AMIABLY BEAMING AT THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
UPON WHICH THE CLERGYMAN SAID AGAIN WHO GIVETH THIS WOMAN TO BE
MARRIED TO THIS MAN THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEING STILL IN A STATE OF MOST
ESTIMABLE UNCONSCIOUSNESS THE BRIDEGROOM CRIED OUT IN HIS ACCUSTOMED
VOICE NOW AGED P YOU KNOW WHO GIVETH TO WHICH THE AGED REPLIED
WITH GREAT BRISKNESS BEFORE SAYING THAT HE GAVE ALL RIGHT JOHN
ALL RIGHT MY BOY AND THE CLERGYMAN CAME TO SO GLOOMY A PAUSE UPON
IT THAT I HAD DOUBTS FOR THE MOMENT WHETHER WE SHOULD GET COMPLETELY
MARRIED THAT DAY

IT WAS COMPLETELY DONE HOWEVER AND WHEN WE WERE GOING OUT OF CHURCH
WEMMICK TOOK THE COVER OFF THE FONT AND PUT HIS WHITE GLOVES IN IT
AND PUT THE COVER ON AGAIN MRS WEMMICK MORE HEEDFUL OF THE FUTURE
PUT HER WHITE GLOVES IN HER POCKET AND ASSUMED HER GREEN NOW MR
PIP SAID WEMMICK TRIUMPHANTLY SHOULDERING THE FISHINGROD AS WE CAME
OUT LET ME ASK YOU WHETHER ANYBODY WOULD SUPPOSE THIS TO BE A
WEDDINGPARTY

BREAKFAST HAD BEEN ORDERED AT A PLEASANT LITTLE TAVERN A MILE OR SO
AWAY UPON THE RISING GROUND BEYOND THE GREEN AND THERE WAS A BAGATELLE
BOARD IN THE ROOM IN CASE WE SHOULD DESIRE TO UNBEND OUR MINDS AFTER
THE SOLEMNITY IT WAS PLEASANT TO OBSERVE THAT MRS WEMMICK NO LONGER
UNWOUND WEMMICKS ARM WHEN IT ADAPTED ITSELF TO HER FIGURE BUT SAT IN
A HIGHBACKED CHAIR AGAINST THE WALL LIKE A VIOLONCELLO IN ITS CASE
AND SUBMITTED TO BE EMBRACED AS THAT MELODIOUS INSTRUMENT MIGHT HAVE
DONE

WE HAD AN EXCELLENT BREAKFAST AND WHEN ANY ONE DECLINED ANYTHING ON
TABLE WEMMICK SAID PROVIDED BY CONTRACT YOU KNOW DONT BE AFRAID
OF IT I DRANK TO THE NEW COUPLE DRANK TO THE AGED DRANK TO THE
CASTLE SALUTED THE BRIDE AT PARTING AND MADE MYSELF AS AGREEABLE AS I
COULD

WEMMICK CAME DOWN TO THE DOOR WITH ME AND I AGAIN SHOOK HANDS WITH
HIM AND WISHED HIM JOY

THANKEE SAID WEMMICK RUBBING HIS HANDS SHES SUCH A MANAGER OF
FOWLS YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU SHALL HAVE SOME EGGS AND JUDGE FOR
YOURSELF I SAY MR PIP CALLING ME BACK AND SPEAKING LOW THIS IS
ALTOGETHER A WALWORTH SENTIMENT PLEASE

I UNDERSTAND NOT TO BE MENTIONED IN LITTLE BRITAIN SAID I

WEMMICK NODDED AFTER WHAT YOU LET OUT THE OTHER DAY MR JAGGERS MAY
AS WELL NOT KNOW OF IT HE MIGHT THINK MY BRAIN WAS SOFTENING OR
SOMETHING OF THE KIND




CHAPTER LVI


HE LAY IN PRISON VERY ILL DURING THE WHOLE INTERVAL BETWEEN HIS
COMMITTAL FOR TRIAL AND THE COMING ROUND OF THE SESSIONS HE HAD BROKEN
TWO RIBS THEY HAD WOUNDED ONE OF HIS LUNGS AND HE BREATHED WITH GREAT
PAIN AND DIFFICULTY WHICH INCREASED DAILY IT WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS
HURT THAT HE SPOKE SO LOW AS TO BE SCARCELY AUDIBLE THEREFORE HE SPOKE
VERY LITTLE BUT HE WAS EVER READY TO LISTEN TO ME AND IT BECAME THE
FIRST DUTY OF MY LIFE TO SAY TO HIM AND READ TO HIM WHAT I KNEW HE
OUGHT TO HEAR

BEING FAR TOO ILL TO REMAIN IN THE COMMON PRISON HE WAS REMOVED AFTER
THE FIRST DAY OR SO INTO THE INFIRMARY THIS GAVE ME OPPORTUNITIES OF
BEING WITH HIM THAT I COULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE HAD AND BUT FOR HIS
ILLNESS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN IRONS FOR HE WAS REGARDED AS A
DETERMINED PRISONBREAKER AND I KNOW NOT WHAT ELSE

ALTHOUGH I SAW HIM EVERY DAY IT WAS FOR ONLY A SHORT TIME HENCE THE
REGULARLY RECURRING SPACES OF OUR SEPARATION WERE LONG ENOUGH TO RECORD
ON HIS FACE ANY SLIGHT CHANGES THAT OCCURRED IN HIS PHYSICAL STATE I
DO NOT RECOLLECT THAT I ONCE SAW ANY CHANGE IN IT FOR THE BETTER HE
WASTED AND BECAME SLOWLY WEAKER AND WORSE DAY BY DAY FROM THE DAY
WHEN THE PRISON DOOR CLOSED UPON HIM

THE KIND OF SUBMISSION OR RESIGNATION THAT HE SHOWED WAS THAT OF A MAN
WHO WAS TIRED OUT I SOMETIMES DERIVED AN IMPRESSION FROM HIS MANNER
OR FROM A WHISPERED WORD OR TWO WHICH ESCAPED HIM THAT HE PONDERED
OVER THE QUESTION WHETHER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAN UNDER BETTER
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT HE NEVER JUSTIFIED HIMSELF BY A HINT TENDING THAT
WAY OR TRIED TO BEND THE PAST OUT OF ITS ETERNAL SHAPE

IT HAPPENED ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS IN MY PRESENCE THAT HIS
DESPERATE REPUTATION WAS ALLUDED TO BY ONE OR OTHER OF THE PEOPLE IN
ATTENDANCE ON HIM A SMILE CROSSED HIS FACE THEN AND HE TURNED HIS
EYES ON ME WITH A TRUSTFUL LOOK AS IF HE WERE CONFIDENT THAT I HAD
SEEN SOME SMALL REDEEMING TOUCH IN HIM EVEN SO LONG AGO AS WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE CHILD AS TO ALL THE REST HE WAS HUMBLE AND CONTRITE AND I
NEVER KNEW HIM COMPLAIN

WHEN THE SESSIONS CAME ROUND MR JAGGERS CAUSED AN APPLICATION TO BE
MADE FOR THE POSTPONEMENT OF HIS TRIAL UNTIL THE FOLLOWING SESSIONS IT
WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE SO LONG
AND WAS REFUSED THE TRIAL CAME ON AT ONCE AND WHEN HE WAS PUT TO THE
BAR HE WAS SEATED IN A CHAIR NO OBJECTION WAS MADE TO MY GETTING
CLOSE TO THE DOCK ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT AND HOLDING THE HAND THAT HE
STRETCHED FORTH TO ME

THE TRIAL WAS VERY SHORT AND VERY CLEAR SUCH THINGS AS COULD BE SAID
FOR HIM WERE SAIDHOW HE HAD TAKEN TO INDUSTRIOUS HABITS AND HAD
THRIVEN LAWFULLY AND REPUTABLY BUT NOTHING COULD UNSAY THE FACT THAT
HE HAD RETURNED AND WAS THERE IN PRESENCE OF THE JUDGE AND JURY IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRY HIM FOR THAT AND DO OTHERWISE THAN FIND HIM
GUILTY

AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE CUSTOM AS I LEARNT FROM MY TERRIBLE
EXPERIENCE OF THAT SESSIONS TO DEVOTE A CONCLUDING DAY TO THE PASSING
OF SENTENCES AND TO MAKE A FINISHING EFFECT WITH THE SENTENCE OF
DEATH BUT FOR THE INDELIBLE PICTURE THAT MY REMEMBRANCE NOW HOLDS
BEFORE ME I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE EVEN AS I WRITE THESE WORDS THAT
I SAW TWOANDTHIRTY MEN AND WOMEN PUT BEFORE THE JUDGE TO RECEIVE THAT
SENTENCE TOGETHER FOREMOST AMONG THE TWOANDTHIRTY WAS HE SEATED
THAT HE MIGHT GET BREATH ENOUGH TO KEEP LIFE IN HIM

THE WHOLE SCENE STARTS OUT AGAIN IN THE VIVID COLOURS OF THE MOMENT
DOWN TO THE DROPS OF APRIL RAIN ON THE WINDOWS OF THE COURT GLITTERING
IN THE RAYS OF APRIL SUN PENNED IN THE DOCK AS I AGAIN STOOD OUTSIDE
IT AT THE CORNER WITH HIS HAND IN MINE WERE THE TWOANDTHIRTY MEN AND
WOMEN SOME DEFIANT SOME STRICKEN WITH TERROR SOME SOBBING AND
WEEPING SOME COVERING THEIR FACES SOME STARING GLOOMILY ABOUT THERE
HAD BEEN SHRIEKS FROM AMONG THE WOMEN CONVICTS BUT THEY HAD BEEN
STILLED AND A HUSH HAD SUCCEEDED THE SHERIFFS WITH THEIR GREAT CHAINS
AND NOSEGAYS OTHER CIVIC GEWGAWS AND MONSTERS CRIERS USHERS A GREAT
GALLERY FULL OF PEOPLEA LARGE THEATRICAL AUDIENCELOOKED ON AS THE
TWOANDTHIRTY AND THE JUDGE WERE SOLEMNLY CONFRONTED THEN THE JUDGE
ADDRESSED THEM AMONG THE WRETCHED CREATURES BEFORE HIM WHOM HE MUST
SINGLE OUT FOR SPECIAL ADDRESS WAS ONE WHO ALMOST FROM HIS INFANCY HAD
BEEN AN OFFENDER AGAINST THE LAWS WHO AFTER REPEATED IMPRISONMENTS
AND PUNISHMENTS HAD BEEN AT LENGTH SENTENCED TO EXILE FOR A TERM OF
YEARS AND WHO UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF GREAT VIOLENCE AND DARING HAD
MADE HIS ESCAPE AND BEEN RESENTENCED TO EXILE FOR LIFE THAT MISERABLE
MAN WOULD SEEM FOR A TIME TO HAVE BECOME CONVINCED OF HIS ERRORS WHEN
FAR REMOVED FROM THE SCENES OF HIS OLD OFFENCES AND TO HAVE LIVED A
PEACEABLE AND HONEST LIFE BUT IN A FATAL MOMENT YIELDING TO THOSE
PROPENSITIES AND PASSIONS THE INDULGENCE OF WHICH HAD SO LONG RENDERED
HIM A SCOURGE TO SOCIETY HE HAD QUITTED HIS HAVEN OF REST AND
REPENTANCE AND HAD COME BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE HE WAS PROSCRIBED
BEING HERE PRESENTLY DENOUNCED HE HAD FOR A TIME SUCCEEDED IN EVADING
THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE BUT BEING AT LENGTH SEIZED WHILE IN THE ACT OF
FLIGHT HE HAD RESISTED THEM AND HADHE BEST KNEW WHETHER BY EXPRESS
DESIGN OR IN THE BLINDNESS OF HIS HARDIHOODCAUSED THE DEATH OF HIS
DENOUNCER TO WHOM HIS WHOLE CAREER WAS KNOWN THE APPOINTED PUNISHMENT
FOR HIS RETURN TO THE LAND THAT HAD CAST HIM OUT BEING DEATH AND HIS
CASE BEING THIS AGGRAVATED CASE HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF TO DIE

THE SUN WAS STRIKING IN AT THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE COURT THROUGH THE
GLITTERING DROPS OF RAIN UPON THE GLASS AND IT MADE A BROAD SHAFT OF
LIGHT BETWEEN THE TWOANDTHIRTY AND THE JUDGE LINKING BOTH TOGETHER
AND PERHAPS REMINDING SOME AMONG THE AUDIENCE HOW BOTH WERE PASSING ON
WITH ABSOLUTE EQUALITY TO THE GREATER JUDGMENT THAT KNOWETH ALL
THINGS AND CANNOT ERR RISING FOR A MOMENT A DISTINCT SPECK OF FACE
IN THIS WAY OF LIGHT THE PRISONER SAID MY LORD I HAVE RECEIVED MY
SENTENCE OF DEATH FROM THE ALMIGHTY BUT I BOW TO YOURS AND SAT DOWN
AGAIN THERE WAS SOME HUSHING AND THE JUDGE WENT ON WITH WHAT HE HAD
TO SAY TO THE REST THEN THEY WERE ALL FORMALLY DOOMED AND SOME OF
THEM WERE SUPPORTED OUT AND SOME OF THEM SAUNTERED OUT WITH A HAGGARD
LOOK OF BRAVERY AND A FEW NODDED TO THE GALLERY AND TWO OR THREE
SHOOK HANDS AND OTHERS WENT OUT CHEWING THE FRAGMENTS OF HERB THEY HAD
TAKEN FROM THE SWEET HERBS LYING ABOUT HE WENT LAST OF ALL BECAUSE OF
HAVING TO BE HELPED FROM HIS CHAIR AND TO GO VERY SLOWLY AND HE HELD
MY HAND WHILE ALL THE OTHERS WERE REMOVED AND WHILE THE AUDIENCE GOT
UP PUTTING THEIR DRESSES RIGHT AS THEY MIGHT AT CHURCH OR ELSEWHERE
AND POINTED DOWN AT THIS CRIMINAL OR AT THAT AND MOST OF ALL AT HIM
AND ME

I EARNESTLY HOPED AND PRAYED THAT HE MIGHT DIE BEFORE THE RECORDERS
REPORT WAS MADE BUT IN THE DREAD OF HIS LINGERING ON I BEGAN THAT
NIGHT TO WRITE OUT A PETITION TO THE HOME SECRETARY OF STATE SETTING
FORTH MY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM AND HOW IT WAS THAT HE HAD COME BACK FOR MY
SAKE I WROTE IT AS FERVENTLY AND PATHETICALLY AS I COULD AND WHEN I
HAD FINISHED IT AND SENT IT IN I WROTE OUT OTHER PETITIONS TO SUCH MEN
IN AUTHORITY AS I HOPED WERE THE MOST MERCIFUL AND DREW UP ONE TO THE
CROWN ITSELF FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND NIGHTS AFTER HE WAS SENTENCED I TOOK
NO REST EXCEPT WHEN I FELL ASLEEP IN MY CHAIR BUT WAS WHOLLY ABSORBED
IN THESE APPEALS AND AFTER I HAD SENT THEM IN I COULD NOT KEEP AWAY
FROM THE PLACES WHERE THEY WERE BUT FELT AS IF THEY WERE MORE HOPEFUL
AND LESS DESPERATE WHEN I WAS NEAR THEM IN THIS UNREASONABLE
RESTLESSNESS AND PAIN OF MIND I WOULD ROAM THE STREETS OF AN EVENING
WANDERING BY THOSE OFFICES AND HOUSES WHERE I HAD LEFT THE PETITIONS
TO THE PRESENT HOUR THE WEARY WESTERN STREETS OF LONDON ON A COLD
DUSTY SPRING NIGHT WITH THEIR RANGES OF STERN SHUTUP MANSIONS AND
THEIR LONG ROWS OF LAMPS ARE MELANCHOLY TO ME FROM THIS ASSOCIATION

THE DAILY VISITS I COULD MAKE HIM WERE SHORTENED NOW AND HE WAS MORE
STRICTLY KEPT SEEING OR FANCYING THAT I WAS SUSPECTED OF AN
INTENTION OF CARRYING POISON TO HIM I ASKED TO BE SEARCHED BEFORE I
SAT DOWN AT HIS BEDSIDE AND TOLD THE OFFICER WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE
THAT I WAS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD ASSURE HIM OF THE
SINGLENESS OF MY DESIGNS NOBODY WAS HARD WITH HIM OR WITH ME THERE
WAS DUTY TO BE DONE AND IT WAS DONE BUT NOT HARSHLY THE OFFICER
ALWAYS GAVE ME THE ASSURANCE THAT HE WAS WORSE AND SOME OTHER SICK
PRISONERS IN THE ROOM AND SOME OTHER PRISONERS WHO ATTENDED ON THEM AS
SICK NURSES MALEFACTORS BUT NOT INCAPABLE OF KINDNESS GOD BE
THANKED ALWAYS JOINED IN THE SAME REPORT

AS THE DAYS WENT ON I NOTICED MORE AND MORE THAT HE WOULD LIE PLACIDLY
LOOKING AT THE WHITE CEILING WITH AN ABSENCE OF LIGHT IN HIS FACE
UNTIL SOME WORD OF MINE BRIGHTENED IT FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN IT WOULD
SUBSIDE AGAIN SOMETIMES HE WAS ALMOST OR QUITE UNABLE TO SPEAK THEN
HE WOULD ANSWER ME WITH SLIGHT PRESSURES ON MY HAND AND I GREW TO
UNDERSTAND HIS MEANING VERY WELL

THE NUMBER OF THE DAYS HAD RISEN TO TEN WHEN I SAW A GREATER CHANGE IN
HIM THAN I HAD SEEN YET HIS EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR AND
LIGHTED UP AS I ENTERED

DEAR BOY HE SAID AS I SAT DOWN BY HIS BED I THOUGHT YOU WAS LATE
BUT I KNOWED YOU COULDNT BE THAT

IT IS JUST THE TIME SAID I I WAITED FOR IT AT THE GATE

YOU ALWAYS WAITS AT THE GATE DONT YOU DEAR BOY

YES NOT TO LOSE A MOMENT OF THE TIME

THANKEE DEAR BOY THANKEE GOD BLESS YOU YOUVE NEVER DESERTED ME
DEAR BOY

I PRESSED HIS HAND IN SILENCE FOR I COULD NOT FORGET THAT I HAD ONCE
MEANT TO DESERT HIM

AND WHATS THE BEST OF ALL HE SAID YOUVE BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE
ALONGER ME SINCE I WAS UNDER A DARK CLOUD THAN WHEN THE SUN SHONE
THATS BEST OF ALL

HE LAY ON HIS BACK BREATHING WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY DO WHAT HE WOULD
AND LOVE ME THOUGH HE DID THE LIGHT LEFT HIS FACE EVER AND AGAIN AND
A FILM CAME OVER THE PLACID LOOK AT THE WHITE CEILING

ARE YOU IN MUCH PAIN TODAY

I DONT COMPLAIN OF NONE DEAR BOY

YOU NEVER DO COMPLAIN

HE HAD SPOKEN HIS LAST WORDS HE SMILED AND I UNDERSTOOD HIS TOUCH TO
MEAN THAT HE WISHED TO LIFT MY HAND AND LAY IT ON HIS BREAST I LAID
IT THERE AND HE SMILED AGAIN AND PUT BOTH HIS HANDS UPON IT

THE ALLOTTED TIME RAN OUT WHILE WE WERE THUS BUT LOOKING ROUND I
FOUND THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON STANDING NEAR ME AND HE WHISPERED
YOU NEEDNT GO YET I THANKED HIM GRATEFULLY AND ASKED MIGHT I
SPEAK TO HIM IF HE CAN HEAR ME

THE GOVERNOR STEPPED ASIDE AND BECKONED THE OFFICER AWAY THE CHANGE
THOUGH IT WAS MADE WITHOUT NOISE DREW BACK THE FILM FROM THE PLACID
LOOK AT THE WHITE CEILING AND HE LOOKED MOST AFFECTIONATELY AT ME

DEAR MAGWITCH I MUST TELL YOU NOW AT LAST YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I
SAY

A GENTLE PRESSURE ON MY HAND

YOU HAD A CHILD ONCE WHOM YOU LOVED AND LOST

A STRONGER PRESSURE ON MY HAND

SHE LIVED AND FOUND POWERFUL FRIENDS SHE IS LIVING NOW SHE IS A
LADY AND VERY BEAUTIFUL AND I LOVE HER

WITH A LAST FAINT EFFORT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN POWERLESS BUT FOR MY
YIELDING TO IT AND ASSISTING IT HE RAISED MY HAND TO HIS LIPS THEN
HE GENTLY LET IT SINK UPON HIS BREAST AGAIN WITH HIS OWN HANDS LYING
ON IT THE PLACID LOOK AT THE WHITE CEILING CAME BACK AND PASSED AWAY
AND HIS HEAD DROPPED QUIETLY ON HIS BREAST

MINDFUL THEN OF WHAT WE HAD READ TOGETHER I THOUGHT OF THE TWO MEN
WHO WENT UP INTO THE TEMPLE TO PRAY AND I KNEW THERE WERE NO BETTER
WORDS THAT I COULD SAY BESIDE HIS BED THAN O LORD BE MERCIFUL TO HIM
A SINNER




CHAPTER LVII


NOW THAT I WAS LEFT WHOLLY TO MYSELF I GAVE NOTICE OF MY INTENTION TO
QUIT THE CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE AS SOON AS MY TENANCY COULD LEGALLY
DETERMINE AND IN THE MEANWHILE TO UNDERLET THEM AT ONCE I PUT BILLS
UP IN THE WINDOWS FOR I WAS IN DEBT AND HAD SCARCELY ANY MONEY AND
BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED BY THE STATE OF MY AFFAIRS I OUGHT
RATHER TO WRITE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMED IF I HAD HAD ENERGY AND
CONCENTRATION ENOUGH TO HELP ME TO THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF ANY TRUTH
BEYOND THE FACT THAT I WAS FALLING VERY ILL THE LATE STRESS UPON ME
HAD ENABLED ME TO PUT OFF ILLNESS BUT NOT TO PUT IT AWAY I KNEW THAT
IT WAS COMING ON ME NOW AND I KNEW VERY LITTLE ELSE AND WAS EVEN
CARELESS AS TO THAT

FOR A DAY OR TWO I LAY ON THE SOFA OR ON THE FLOORANYWHERE
ACCORDING AS I HAPPENED TO SINK DOWNWITH A HEAVY HEAD AND ACHING
LIMBS AND NO PURPOSE AND NO POWER THEN THERE CAME ONE NIGHT WHICH
APPEARED OF GREAT DURATION AND WHICH TEEMED WITH ANXIETY AND HORROR
AND WHEN IN THE MORNING I TRIED TO SIT UP IN MY BED AND THINK OF IT I
FOUND I COULD NOT DO SO

WHETHER I REALLY HAD BEEN DOWN IN GARDEN COURT IN THE DEAD OF THE
NIGHT GROPING ABOUT FOR THE BOAT THAT I SUPPOSED TO BE THERE WHETHER
I HAD TWO OR THREE TIMES COME TO MYSELF ON THE STAIRCASE WITH GREAT
TERROR NOT KNOWING HOW I HAD GOT OUT OF BED WHETHER I HAD FOUND
MYSELF LIGHTING THE LAMP POSSESSED BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS COMING UP
THE STAIRS AND THAT THE LIGHTS WERE BLOWN OUT WHETHER I HAD BEEN
INEXPRESSIBLY HARASSED BY THE DISTRACTED TALKING LAUGHING AND
GROANING OF SOME ONE AND HAD HALF SUSPECTED THOSE SOUNDS TO BE OF MY
OWN MAKING WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN A CLOSED IRON FURNACE IN A DARK
CORNER OF THE ROOM AND A VOICE HAD CALLED OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT MISS HAVISHAM WAS CONSUMING WITHIN ITTHESE WERE THINGS THAT I
TRIED TO SETTLE WITH MYSELF AND GET INTO SOME ORDER AS I LAY THAT
MORNING ON MY BED BUT THE VAPOUR OF A LIMEKILN WOULD COME BETWEEN ME
AND THEM DISORDERING THEM ALL AND IT WAS THROUGH THE VAPOUR AT LAST
THAT I SAW TWO MEN LOOKING AT ME

WHAT DO YOU WANT I ASKED STARTING I DONT KNOW YOU

WELL SIR RETURNED ONE OF THEM BENDING DOWN AND TOUCHING ME ON THE
SHOULDER THIS IS A MATTER THAT YOULL SOON ARRANGE I DARE SAY BUT
YOURE ARRESTED

WHAT IS THE DEBT

HUNDRED AND TWENTYTHREE POUND FIFTEEN SIX JEWELLERS ACCOUNT I
THINK

WHAT IS TO BE DONE

YOU HAD BETTER COME TO MY HOUSE SAID THE MAN I KEEP A VERY NICE
HOUSE

I MADE SOME ATTEMPT TO GET UP AND DRESS MYSELF WHEN I NEXT ATTENDED TO
THEM THEY WERE STANDING A LITTLE OFF FROM THE BED LOOKING AT ME I
STILL LAY THERE

YOU SEE MY STATE SAID I I WOULD COME WITH YOU IF I COULD BUT
INDEED I AM QUITE UNABLE IF YOU TAKE ME FROM HERE I THINK I SHALL DIE
BY THE WAY

PERHAPS THEY REPLIED OR ARGUED THE POINT OR TRIED TO ENCOURAGE ME TO
BELIEVE THAT I WAS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT FORASMUCH AS THEY HANG IN MY
MEMORY BY ONLY THIS ONE SLENDER THREAD I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY DID
EXCEPT THAT THEY FORBORE TO REMOVE ME

THAT I HAD A FEVER AND WAS AVOIDED THAT I SUFFERED GREATLY THAT I
OFTEN LOST MY REASON THAT THE TIME SEEMED INTERMINABLE THAT I
CONFOUNDED IMPOSSIBLE EXISTENCES WITH MY OWN IDENTITY THAT I WAS A
BRICK IN THE HOUSEWALL AND YET ENTREATING TO BE RELEASED FROM THE
GIDDY PLACE WHERE THE BUILDERS HAD SET ME THAT I WAS A STEEL BEAM OF A
VAST ENGINE CLASHING AND WHIRLING OVER A GULF AND YET THAT I IMPLORED
IN MY OWN PERSON TO HAVE THE ENGINE STOPPED AND MY PART IN IT HAMMERED
OFF THAT I PASSED THROUGH THESE PHASES OF DISEASE I KNOW OF MY OWN
REMEMBRANCE AND DID IN SOME SORT KNOW AT THE TIME THAT I SOMETIMES
STRUGGLED WITH REAL PEOPLE IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE MURDERERS AND
THAT I WOULD ALL AT ONCE COMPREHEND THAT THEY MEANT TO DO ME GOOD AND
WOULD THEN SINK EXHAUSTED IN THEIR ARMS AND SUFFER THEM TO LAY ME
DOWN I ALSO KNEW AT THE TIME BUT ABOVE ALL I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A
CONSTANT TENDENCY IN ALL THESE PEOPLEWHO WHEN I WAS VERY ILL WOULD
PRESENT ALL KINDS OF EXTRAORDINARY TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE HUMAN FACE
AND WOULD BE MUCH DILATED IN SIZEABOVE ALL I SAY I KNEW THAT THERE
WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY TENDENCY IN ALL THESE PEOPLE SOONER OR LATER TO
SETTLE DOWN INTO THE LIKENESS OF JOE

AFTER I HAD TURNED THE WORST POINT OF MY ILLNESS I BEGAN TO NOTICE
THAT WHILE ALL ITS OTHER FEATURES CHANGED THIS ONE CONSISTENT FEATURE
DID NOT CHANGE WHOEVER CAME ABOUT ME STILL SETTLED DOWN INTO JOE I
OPENED MY EYES IN THE NIGHT AND I SAW IN THE GREAT CHAIR AT THE
BEDSIDE JOE I OPENED MY EYES IN THE DAY AND SITTING ON THE
WINDOWSEAT SMOKING HIS PIPE IN THE SHADED OPEN WINDOW STILL I SAW
JOE I ASKED FOR COOLING DRINK AND THE DEAR HAND THAT GAVE IT ME WAS
JOES I SANK BACK ON MY PILLOW AFTER DRINKING AND THE FACE THAT
LOOKED SO HOPEFULLY AND TENDERLY UPON ME WAS THE FACE OF JOE

AT LAST ONE DAY I TOOK COURAGE AND SAID IS IT JOE

AND THE DEAR OLD HOMEVOICE ANSWERED WHICH IT AIR OLD CHAP

O JOE YOU BREAK MY HEART LOOK ANGRY AT ME JOE STRIKE ME JOE TELL
ME OF MY INGRATITUDE DONT BE SO GOOD TO ME

FOR JOE HAD ACTUALLY LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE PILLOW AT MY SIDE AND
PUT HIS ARM ROUND MY NECK IN HIS JOY THAT I KNEW HIM

WHICH DEAR OLD PIP OLD CHAP SAID JOE YOU AND ME WAS EVER FRIENDS
AND WHEN YOURE WELL ENOUGH TO GO OUT FOR A RIDEWHAT LARKS

AFTER WHICH JOE WITHDREW TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD WITH HIS BACK
TOWARDS ME WIPING HIS EYES AND AS MY EXTREME WEAKNESS PREVENTED ME
FROM GETTING UP AND GOING TO HIM I LAY THERE PENITENTLY WHISPERING
O GOD BLESS HIM O GOD BLESS THIS GENTLE CHRISTIAN MAN

JOES EYES WERE RED WHEN I NEXT FOUND HIM BESIDE ME BUT I WAS HOLDING
HIS HAND AND WE BOTH FELT HAPPY

HOW LONG DEAR JOE

WHICH YOU MEANTERSAY PIP HOW LONG HAVE YOUR ILLNESS LASTED DEAR OLD
CHAP

YES JOE

ITS THE END OF MAY PIP TOMORROW IS THE FIRST OF JUNE

AND HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL THAT TIME DEAR JOE

PRETTY NIGH OLD CHAP FOR AS I SAYS TO BIDDY WHEN THE NEWS OF YOUR
BEING ILL WERE BROUGHT BY LETTER WHICH IT WERE BROUGHT BY THE POST
AND BEING FORMERLY SINGLE HE IS NOW MARRIED THOUGH UNDERPAID FOR A DEAL
OF WALKING AND SHOELEATHER BUT WEALTH WERE NOT A OBJECT ON HIS PART
AND MARRIAGE WERE THE GREAT WISH OF HIS HART

IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR YOU JOE BUT I INTERRUPT YOU IN WHAT YOU
SAID TO BIDDY

WHICH IT WERE SAID JOE THAT HOW YOU MIGHT BE AMONGST STRANGERS
AND THAT HOW YOU AND ME HAVING BEEN EVER FRIENDS A WISIT AT SUCH A
MOMENT MIGHT NOT PROVE UNACCEPTABOBBLE AND BIDDY HER WORD WERE GO
TO HIM WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME THAT SAID JOE SUMMING UP WITH HIS
JUDICIAL AIR WERE THE WORD OF BIDDY GO TO HIM BIDDY SAY WITHOUT
LOSS OF TIME IN SHORT I SHOULDNT GREATLY DECEIVE YOU JOE ADDED
AFTER A LITTLE GRAVE REFLECTION IF I REPRESENTED TO YOU THAT THE WORD
OF THAT YOUNG WOMAN WERE WITHOUT A MINUTES LOSS OF TIME

THERE JOE CUT HIMSELF SHORT AND INFORMED ME THAT I WAS TO BE TALKED TO
IN GREAT MODERATION AND THAT I WAS TO TAKE A LITTLE NOURISHMENT AT
STATED FREQUENT TIMES WHETHER I FELT INCLINED FOR IT OR NOT AND THAT
I WAS TO SUBMIT MYSELF TO ALL HIS ORDERS SO I KISSED HIS HAND AND LAY
QUIET WHILE HE PROCEEDED TO INDITE A NOTE TO BIDDY WITH MY LOVE IN
IT

EVIDENTLY BIDDY HAD TAUGHT JOE TO WRITE AS I LAY IN BED LOOKING AT
HIM IT MADE ME IN MY WEAK STATE CRY AGAIN WITH PLEASURE TO SEE THE
PRIDE WITH WHICH HE SET ABOUT HIS LETTER MY BEDSTEAD DIVESTED OF ITS
CURTAINS HAD BEEN REMOVED WITH ME UPON IT INTO THE SITTINGROOM AS
THE AIRIEST AND LARGEST AND THE CARPET HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND THE
ROOM KEPT ALWAYS FRESH AND WHOLESOME NIGHT AND DAY AT MY OWN
WRITINGTABLE PUSHED INTO A CORNER AND CUMBERED WITH LITTLE BOTTLES
JOE NOW SAT DOWN TO HIS GREAT WORK FIRST CHOOSING A PEN FROM THE
PENTRAY AS IF IT WERE A CHEST OF LARGE TOOLS AND TUCKING UP HIS
SLEEVES AS IF HE WERE GOING TO WIELD A CROWBAR OR SLEDGEHAMMER IT WAS
NECESSARY FOR JOE TO HOLD ON HEAVILY TO THE TABLE WITH HIS LEFT ELBOW
AND TO GET HIS RIGHT LEG WELL OUT BEHIND HIM BEFORE HE COULD BEGIN
AND WHEN HE DID BEGIN HE MADE EVERY DOWNSTROKE SO SLOWLY THAT IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN SIX FEET LONG WHILE AT EVERY UPSTROKE I COULD HEAR HIS PEN
SPLUTTERING EXTENSIVELY HE HAD A CURIOUS IDEA THAT THE INKSTAND WAS ON
THE SIDE OF HIM WHERE IT WAS NOT AND CONSTANTLY DIPPED HIS PEN INTO
SPACE AND SEEMED QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OCCASIONALLY HE WAS
TRIPPED UP BY SOME ORTHOGRAPHICAL STUMBLINGBLOCK BUT ON THE WHOLE HE
GOT ON VERY WELL INDEED AND WHEN HE HAD SIGNED HIS NAME AND HAD
REMOVED A FINISHING BLOT FROM THE PAPER TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD WITH
HIS TWO FOREFINGERS HE GOT UP AND HOVERED ABOUT THE TABLE TRYING THE
EFFECT OF HIS PERFORMANCE FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AS IT LAY THERE
WITH UNBOUNDED SATISFACTION

NOT TO MAKE JOE UNEASY BY TALKING TOO MUCH EVEN IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO
TALK MUCH I DEFERRED ASKING HIM ABOUT MISS HAVISHAM UNTIL NEXT DAY HE
SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN I THEN ASKED HIM IF SHE HAD RECOVERED

IS SHE DEAD JOE

WHY YOU SEE OLD CHAP SAID JOE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE AND BY
WAY OF GETTING AT IT BY DEGREES I WOULDNT GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT
FOR THATS A DEAL TO SAY BUT SHE AINT

LIVING JOE

THATS NIGHER WHERE IT IS SAID JOE SHE AINT LIVING

DID SHE LINGER LONG JOE

ARTER YOU WAS TOOK ILL PRETTY MUCH ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL IF YOU
WAS PUT TO IT A WEEK SAID JOE STILL DETERMINED ON MY ACCOUNT TO
COME AT EVERYTHING BY DEGREES

DEAR JOE HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT BECOMES OF HER PROPERTY

WELL OLD CHAP SAID JOE IT DO APPEAR THAT SHE HAD SETTLED THE MOST
OF IT WHICH I MEANTERSAY TIED IT UP ON MISS ESTELLA BUT SHE HAD
WROTE OUT A LITTLE CODDLESHELL IN HER OWN HAND A DAY OR TWO AFORE THE
ACCIDENT LEAVING A COOL FOUR THOUSAND TO MR MATTHEW POCKET AND WHY
DO YOU SUPPOSE ABOVE ALL THINGS PIP SHE LEFT THAT COOL FOUR THOUSAND
UNTO HIM BECAUSE OF PIPS ACCOUNT OF HIM THE SAID MATTHEW I AM
TOLD BY BIDDY THAT AIR THE WRITING SAID JOE REPEATING THE LEGAL
TURN AS IF IT DID HIM INFINITE GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIM THE SAID
MATTHEW AND A COOL FOUR THOUSAND PIP

I NEVER DISCOVERED FROM WHOM JOE DERIVED THE CONVENTIONAL TEMPERATURE
OF THE FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS BUT IT APPEARED TO MAKE THE SUM OF MONEY
MORE TO HIM AND HE HAD A MANIFEST RELISH IN INSISTING ON ITS BEING
COOL

THIS ACCOUNT GAVE ME GREAT JOY AS IT PERFECTED THE ONLY GOOD THING I
HAD DONE I ASKED JOE WHETHER HE HAD HEARD IF ANY OF THE OTHER
RELATIONS HAD ANY LEGACIES

MISS SARAH SAID JOE SHE HAVE TWENTYFIVE POUND PERANNIUM FUR TO
BUY PILLS ON ACCOUNT OF BEING BILIOUS MISS GEORGIANA SHE HAVE TWENTY
POUND DOWN MRSWHATS THE NAME OF THEM WILD BEASTS WITH HUMPS OLD
CHAP

CAMELS SAID I WONDERING WHY HE COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO KNOW

JOE NODDED MRS CAMELS BY WHICH I PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD HE MEANT
CAMILLA SHE HAVE FIVE POUND FUR TO BUY RUSHLIGHTS TO PUT HER IN
SPIRITS WHEN SHE WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT

THE ACCURACY OF THESE RECITALS WAS SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS TO ME TO GIVE
ME GREAT CONFIDENCE IN JOES INFORMATION AND NOW SAID JOE YOU
AINT THAT STRONG YET OLD CHAP THAT YOU CAN TAKE IN MORE NOR ONE
ADDITIONAL SHOVELFUL TODAY OLD ORLICK HES BEEN A BUSTIN OPEN A
DWELLINGOUSE

WHOSE SAID I

NOT I GRANT YOU BUT WHAT HIS MANNERS IS GIVEN TO BLUSTEROUS SAID
JOE APOLOGETICALLY STILL A ENGLISHMANS OUSE IS HIS CASTLE AND
CASTLES MUST NOT BE BUSTED CEPT WHEN DONE IN WAR TIME AND WOTSUMEER
THE FAILINGS ON HIS PART HE WERE A CORN AND SEEDSMAN IN HIS HART

IS IT PUMBLECHOOKS HOUSE THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO THEN

THATS IT PIP SAID JOE AND THEY TOOK HIS TILL AND THEY TOOK HIS
CASHBOX AND THEY DRINKED HIS WINE AND THEY PARTOOK OF HIS WITTLES
AND THEY SLAPPED HIS FACE AND THEY PULLED HIS NOSE AND THEY TIED HIM
UP TO HIS BEDPUST AND THEY GIV HIM A DOZEN AND THEY STUFFED HIS
MOUTH FULL OF FLOWERING ANNUALS TO PREWENT HIS CRYING OUT BUT HE
KNOWED ORLICK AND ORLICKS IN THE COUNTY JAIL

BY THESE APPROACHES WE ARRIVED AT UNRESTRICTED CONVERSATION I WAS SLOW
TO GAIN STRENGTH BUT I DID SLOWLY AND SURELY BECOME LESS WEAK AND JOE
STAYED WITH ME AND I FANCIED I WAS LITTLE PIP AGAIN

FOR THE TENDERNESS OF JOE WAS SO BEAUTIFULLY PROPORTIONED TO MY NEED
THAT I WAS LIKE A CHILD IN HIS HANDS HE WOULD SIT AND TALK TO ME IN
THE OLD CONFIDENCE AND WITH THE OLD SIMPLICITY AND IN THE OLD
UNASSERTIVE PROTECTING WAY SO THAT I WOULD HALF BELIEVE THAT ALL MY
LIFE SINCE THE DAYS OF THE OLD KITCHEN WAS ONE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLES
OF THE FEVER THAT WAS GONE HE DID EVERYTHING FOR ME EXCEPT THE
HOUSEHOLD WORK FOR WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED A VERY DECENT WOMAN AFTER
PAYING OFF THE LAUNDRESS ON HIS FIRST ARRIVAL WHICH I DO ASSURE YOU
PIP HE WOULD OFTEN SAY IN EXPLANATION OF THAT LIBERTY I FOUND HER
A TAPPING THE SPARE BED LIKE A CASK OF BEER AND DRAWING OFF THE
FEATHERS IN A BUCKET FOR SALE WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE TAPPED YOURN NEXT
AND DRAWD IT OFF WITH YOU A LAYING ON IT AND WAS THEN A CARRYING AWAY
THE COALS GRADIWALLY IN THE SOUPTUREEN AND WEGETABLEDISHES AND THE
WINE AND SPIRITS IN YOUR WELLINGTON BOOTS

WE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN I SHOULD GO OUT FOR A RIDE AS WE HAD
ONCE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE DAY OF MY APPRENTICESHIP AND WHEN THE DAY
CAME AND AN OPEN CARRIAGE WAS GOT INTO THE LANE JOE WRAPPED ME UP
TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS CARRIED ME DOWN TO IT AND PUT ME IN AS IF I WERE
STILL THE SMALL HELPLESS CREATURE TO WHOM HE HAD SO ABUNDANTLY GIVEN OF
THE WEALTH OF HIS GREAT NATURE

AND JOE GOT IN BESIDE ME AND WE DROVE AWAY TOGETHER INTO THE COUNTRY
WHERE THE RICH SUMMER GROWTH WAS ALREADY ON THE TREES AND ON THE GRASS
AND SWEET SUMMER SCENTS FILLED ALL THE AIR THE DAY HAPPENED TO BE
SUNDAY AND WHEN I LOOKED ON THE LOVELINESS AROUND ME AND THOUGHT HOW
IT HAD GROWN AND CHANGED AND HOW THE LITTLE WILDFLOWERS HAD BEEN
FORMING AND THE VOICES OF THE BIRDS HAD BEEN STRENGTHENING BY DAY AND
BY NIGHT UNDER THE SUN AND UNDER THE STARS WHILE POOR I LAY BURNING
AND TOSSING ON MY BED THE MERE REMEMBRANCE OF HAVING BURNED AND TOSSED
THERE CAME LIKE A CHECK UPON MY PEACE BUT WHEN I HEARD THE SUNDAY
BELLS AND LOOKED AROUND A LITTLE MORE UPON THE OUTSPREAD BEAUTY I
FELT THAT I WAS NOT NEARLY THANKFUL ENOUGHTHAT I WAS TOO WEAK YET TO
BE EVEN THATAND I LAID MY HEAD ON JOES SHOULDER AS I HAD LAID IT
LONG AGO WHEN HE HAD TAKEN ME TO THE FAIR OR WHERE NOT AND IT WAS TOO
MUCH FOR MY YOUNG SENSES

MORE COMPOSURE CAME TO ME AFTER A WHILE AND WE TALKED AS WE USED TO
TALK LYING ON THE GRASS AT THE OLD BATTERY THERE WAS NO CHANGE
WHATEVER IN JOE EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEEN IN MY EYES THEN HE WAS IN MY
EYES STILL JUST AS SIMPLY FAITHFUL AND AS SIMPLY RIGHT

WHEN WE GOT BACK AGAIN AND HE LIFTED ME OUT AND CARRIED MESO
EASILYACROSS THE COURT AND UP THE STAIRS I THOUGHT OF THAT EVENTFUL
CHRISTMAS DAY WHEN HE HAD CARRIED ME OVER THE MARSHES WE HAD NOT YET
MADE ANY ALLUSION TO MY CHANGE OF FORTUNE NOR DID I KNOW HOW MUCH OF
MY LATE HISTORY HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH I WAS SO DOUBTFUL OF MYSELF
NOW AND PUT SO MUCH TRUST IN HIM THAT I COULD NOT SATISFY MYSELF
WHETHER I OUGHT TO REFER TO IT WHEN HE DID NOT

HAVE YOU HEARD JOE I ASKED HIM THAT EVENING UPON FURTHER
CONSIDERATION AS HE SMOKED HIS PIPE AT THE WINDOW WHO MY PATRON
WAS

I HEERD RETURNED JOE AS IT WERE NOT MISS HAVISHAM OLD CHAP

DID YOU HEAR WHO IT WAS JOE

WELL I HEERD AS IT WERE A PERSON WHAT SENT THE PERSON WHAT GIV YOU
THE BANKNOTES AT THE JOLLY BARGEMEN PIP

SO IT WAS

ASTONISHING SAID JOE IN THE PLACIDEST WAY

DID YOU HEAR THAT HE WAS DEAD JOE I PRESENTLY ASKED WITH
INCREASING DIFFIDENCE

WHICH HIM AS SENT THE BANKNOTES PIP

YES

I THINK SAID JOE AFTER MEDITATING A LONG TIME AND LOOKING RATHER
EVASIVELY AT THE WINDOWSEAT AS I DID HEAR TELL THAT HOW HE WERE
SOMETHING OR ANOTHER IN A GENERAL WAY IN THAT DIRECTION

DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING OF HIS CIRCUMSTANCES JOE

NOT PARTICKLER PIP

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR JOE I WAS BEGINNING WHEN JOE GOT UP AND
CAME TO MY SOFA

LOOKEE HERE OLD CHAP SAID JOE BENDING OVER ME EVER THE BEST OF
FRIENDS AINT US PIP

I WAS ASHAMED TO ANSWER HIM

WERY GOOD THEN SAID JOE AS IF I HAD ANSWERED THATS ALL RIGHT
THATS AGREED UPON THEN WHY GO INTO SUBJECTS OLD CHAP WHICH AS
BETWIXT TWO SECH MUST BE FOR EVER ONNECESSARY THERES SUBJECTS ENOUGH
AS BETWIXT TWO SECH WITHOUT ONNECESSARY ONES LORD TO THINK OF YOUR
POOR SISTER AND HER RAMPAGES AND DONT YOU REMEMBER TICKLER

I DO INDEED JOE

LOOKEE HERE OLD CHAP SAID JOE I DONE WHAT I COULD TO KEEP YOU AND
TICKLER IN SUNDERS BUT MY POWER WERE NOT ALWAYS FULLY EQUAL TO MY
INCLINATIONS FOR WHEN YOUR POOR SISTER HAD A MIND TO DROP INTO YOU IT
WERE NOT SO MUCH SAID JOE IN HIS FAVOURITE ARGUMENTATIVE WAY THAT
SHE DROPPED INTO ME TOO IF I PUT MYSELF IN OPPOSITION TO HER BUT THAT
SHE DROPPED INTO YOU ALWAYS HEAVIER FOR IT I NOTICED THAT IT AINT A
GRAB AT A MANS WHISKER NOT YET A SHAKE OR TWO OF A MAN TO WHICH YOUR
SISTER WAS QUITE WELCOME THAT UD PUT A MAN OFF FROM GETTING A LITTLE
CHILD OUT OF PUNISHMENT BUT WHEN THAT LITTLE CHILD IS DROPPED INTO
HEAVIER FOR THAT GRAB OF WHISKER OR SHAKING THEN THAT MAN NATERALLY UP
AND SAYS TO HIMSELF WHERE IS THE GOOD AS YOU ARE ADOING I GRANT YOU
I SEE THE ARM SAYS THE MAN BUT I DONT SEE THE GOOD I CALL UPON
YOU SIR THEREFORE TO PINT OUT THE GOOD

THE MAN SAYS I OBSERVED AS JOE WAITED FOR ME TO SPEAK

THE MAN SAYS JOE ASSENTED IS HE RIGHT THAT MAN

DEAR JOE HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT

WELL OLD CHAP SAID JOE THEN ABIDE BY YOUR WORDS IF HES ALWAYS
RIGHT WHICH IN GENERAL HES MORE LIKELY WRONG HES RIGHT WHEN HE
SAYS THIS SUPPOSING EVER YOU KEP ANY LITTLE MATTER TO YOURSELF WHEN
YOU WAS A LITTLE CHILD YOU KEP IT MOSTLY BECAUSE YOU KNOWD AS J
GARGERYS POWER TO PART YOU AND TICKLER IN SUNDERS WERE NOT FULLY EQUAL
TO HIS INCLINATIONS THEERFORE THINK NO MORE OF IT AS BETWIXT TWO
SECH AND DO NOT LET US PASS REMARKS UPON ONNECESSARY SUBJECTS BIDDY
GIV HERSELF A DEAL O TROUBLE WITH ME AFORE I LEFT FOR I AM ALMOST
AWFUL DULL AS I SHOULD VIEW IT IN THIS LIGHT AND VIEWING IT IN THIS
LIGHT AS I SHOULD SO PUT IT BOTH OF WHICH SAID JOE QUITE CHARMED
WITH HIS LOGICAL ARRANGEMENT BEING DONE NOW THIS TO YOU A TRUE
FRIEND SAY NAMELY YOU MUSTNT GO A OVERDOING ON IT BUT YOU MUST
HAVE YOUR SUPPER AND YOUR WINE AND WATER AND YOU MUST BE PUT BETWIXT
THE SHEETS

THE DELICACY WITH WHICH JOE DISMISSED THIS THEME AND THE SWEET TACT
AND KINDNESS WITH WHICH BIDDYWHO WITH HER WOMANS WIT HAD FOUND ME OUT
SO SOONHAD PREPARED HIM FOR IT MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON MY MIND BUT
WHETHER JOE KNEW HOW POOR I WAS AND HOW MY GREAT EXPECTATIONS HAD ALL
DISSOLVED LIKE OUR OWN MARSH MISTS BEFORE THE SUN I COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND

ANOTHER THING IN JOE THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHEN IT FIRST BEGAN TO
DEVELOP ITSELF BUT WHICH I SOON ARRIVED AT A SORROWFUL COMPREHENSION
OF WAS THIS AS I BECAME STRONGER AND BETTER JOE BECAME A LITTLE LESS
EASY WITH ME IN MY WEAKNESS AND ENTIRE DEPENDENCE ON HIM THE DEAR
FELLOW HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD TONE AND CALLED ME BY THE OLD NAMES
THE DEAR OLD PIP OLD CHAP THAT NOW WERE MUSIC IN MY EARS I TOO HAD
FALLEN INTO THE OLD WAYS ONLY HAPPY AND THANKFUL THAT HE LET ME BUT
IMPERCEPTIBLY THOUGH I HELD BY THEM FAST JOES HOLD UPON THEM BEGAN
TO SLACKEN AND WHEREAS I WONDERED AT THIS AT FIRST I SOON BEGAN TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CAUSE OF IT WAS IN ME AND THAT THE FAULT OF IT WAS
ALL MINE

AH HAD I GIVEN JOE NO REASON TO DOUBT MY CONSTANCY AND TO THINK THAT
IN PROSPERITY I SHOULD GROW COLD TO HIM AND CAST HIM OFF HAD I GIVEN
JOES INNOCENT HEART NO CAUSE TO FEEL INSTINCTIVELY THAT AS I GOT
STRONGER HIS HOLD UPON ME WOULD BE WEAKER AND THAT HE HAD BETTER
LOOSEN IT IN TIME AND LET ME GO BEFORE I PLUCKED MYSELF AWAY

IT WAS ON THE THIRD OR FOURTH OCCASION OF MY GOING OUT WALKING IN THE
TEMPLE GARDENS LEANING ON JOES ARM THAT I SAW THIS CHANGE IN HIM VERY
PLAINLY WE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE BRIGHT WARM SUNLIGHT LOOKING AT
THE RIVER AND I CHANCED TO SAY AS WE GOT UP

SEE JOE I CAN WALK QUITE STRONGLY NOW YOU SHALL SEE ME WALK BACK
BY MYSELF

WHICH DO NOT OVERDO IT PIP SAID JOE BUT I SHALL BE HAPPY FUR TO
SEE YOU ABLE SIR

THE LAST WORD GRATED ON ME BUT HOW COULD I REMONSTRATE I WALKED NO
FURTHER THAN THE GATE OF THE GARDENS AND THEN PRETENDED TO BE WEAKER
THAN I WAS AND ASKED JOE FOR HIS ARM JOE GAVE IT ME BUT WAS
THOUGHTFUL

I FOR MY PART WAS THOUGHTFUL TOO FOR HOW BEST TO CHECK THIS GROWING
CHANGE IN JOE WAS A GREAT PERPLEXITY TO MY REMORSEFUL THOUGHTS THAT I
WAS ASHAMED TO TELL HIM EXACTLY HOW I WAS PLACED AND WHAT I HAD COME
DOWN TO I DO NOT SEEK TO CONCEAL BUT I HOPE MY RELUCTANCE WAS NOT
QUITE AN UNWORTHY ONE HE WOULD WANT TO HELP ME OUT OF HIS LITTLE
SAVINGS I KNEW AND I KNEW THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HELP ME AND THAT I
MUST NOT SUFFER HIM TO DO IT

IT WAS A THOUGHTFUL EVENING WITH BOTH OF US BUT BEFORE WE WENT TO
BED I HAD RESOLVED THAT I WOULD WAIT OVER TOMORROWTOMORROW BEING
SUNDAYAND WOULD BEGIN MY NEW COURSE WITH THE NEW WEEK ON MONDAY
MORNING I WOULD SPEAK TO JOE ABOUT THIS CHANGE I WOULD LAY ASIDE THIS
LAST VESTIGE OF RESERVE I WOULD TELL HIM WHAT I HAD IN MY THOUGHTS
THAT SECONDLY NOT YET ARRIVED AT AND WHY I HAD NOT DECIDED TO GO
OUT TO HERBERT AND THEN THE CHANGE WOULD BE CONQUERED FOR EVER AS I
CLEARED JOE CLEARED AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD SYMPATHETICALLY
ARRIVED AT A RESOLUTION TOO

WE HAD A QUIET DAY ON THE SUNDAY AND WE RODE OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND
THEN WALKED IN THE FIELDS

I FEEL THANKFUL THAT I HAVE BEEN ILL JOE I SAID

DEAR OLD PIP OLD CHAP YOURE AMOST COME ROUND SIR

IT HAS BEEN A MEMORABLE TIME FOR ME JOE

LIKEWAYS FOR MYSELF SIR JOE RETURNED

WE HAVE HAD A TIME TOGETHER JOE THAT I CAN NEVER FORGET THERE WERE
DAYS ONCE I KNOW THAT I DID FOR A WHILE FORGET BUT I NEVER SHALL
FORGET THESE

PIP SAID JOE APPEARING A LITTLE HURRIED AND TROUBLED THERE HAS
BEEN LARKS AND DEAR SIR WHAT HAVE BEEN BETWIXT USHAVE BEEN

AT NIGHT WHEN I HAD GONE TO BED JOE CAME INTO MY ROOM AS HE HAD DONE
ALL THROUGH MY RECOVERY HE ASKED ME IF I FELT SURE THAT I WAS AS WELL
AS IN THE MORNING

YES DEAR JOE QUITE

AND ARE ALWAYS A GETTING STRONGER OLD CHAP

YES DEAR JOE STEADILY

JOE PATTED THE COVERLET ON MY SHOULDER WITH HIS GREAT GOOD HAND AND
SAID IN WHAT I THOUGHT A HUSKY VOICE GOOD NIGHT

WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING REFRESHED AND STRONGER YET I WAS FULL OF
MY RESOLUTION TO TELL JOE ALL WITHOUT DELAY I WOULD TELL HIM BEFORE
BREAKFAST I WOULD DRESS AT ONCE AND GO TO HIS ROOM AND SURPRISE HIM
FOR IT WAS THE FIRST DAY I HAD BEEN UP EARLY I WENT TO HIS ROOM AND
HE WAS NOT THERE NOT ONLY WAS HE NOT THERE BUT HIS BOX WAS GONE

I HURRIED THEN TO THE BREAKFASTTABLE AND ON IT FOUND A LETTER THESE
WERE ITS BRIEF CONTENTS

NOT WISHFUL TO INTRUDE I HAVE DEPARTURED FUR YOU ARE WELL AGAIN DEAR
PIP AND WILL DO BETTER WITHOUT


JO


PS EVER THE BEST OF FRIENDS


ENCLOSED IN THE LETTER WAS A RECEIPT FOR THE DEBT AND COSTS ON WHICH I
HAD BEEN ARRESTED DOWN TO THAT MOMENT I HAD VAINLY SUPPOSED THAT MY
CREDITOR HAD WITHDRAWN OR SUSPENDED PROCEEDINGS UNTIL I SHOULD BE
QUITE RECOVERED I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF JOES HAVING PAID THE MONEY
BUT JOE HAD PAID IT AND THE RECEIPT WAS IN HIS NAME

WHAT REMAINED FOR ME NOW BUT TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE DEAR OLD FORGE AND
THERE TO HAVE OUT MY DISCLOSURE TO HIM AND MY PENITENT REMONSTRANCE
WITH HIM AND THERE TO RELIEVE MY MIND AND HEART OF THAT RESERVED
SECONDLY WHICH HAD BEGUN AS A VAGUE SOMETHING LINGERING IN MY
THOUGHTS AND HAD FORMED INTO A SETTLED PURPOSE

THE PURPOSE WAS THAT I WOULD GO TO BIDDY THAT I WOULD SHOW HER HOW
HUMBLED AND REPENTANT I CAME BACK THAT I WOULD TELL HER HOW I HAD LOST
ALL I ONCE HOPED FOR THAT I WOULD REMIND HER OF OUR OLD CONFIDENCES IN
MY FIRST UNHAPPY TIME THEN I WOULD SAY TO HER BIDDY I THINK YOU
ONCE LIKED ME VERY WELL WHEN MY ERRANT HEART EVEN WHILE IT STRAYED
AWAY FROM YOU WAS QUIETER AND BETTER WITH YOU THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN
SINCE IF YOU CAN LIKE ME ONLY HALF AS WELL ONCE MORE IF YOU CAN TAKE
ME WITH ALL MY FAULTS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS ON MY HEAD IF YOU CAN
RECEIVE ME LIKE A FORGIVEN CHILD AND INDEED I AM AS SORRY BIDDY AND
HAVE AS MUCH NEED OF A HUSHING VOICE AND A SOOTHING HAND I HOPE I AM
A LITTLE WORTHIER OF YOU THAT I WASNOT MUCH BUT A LITTLE AND
BIDDY IT SHALL REST WITH YOU TO SAY WHETHER I SHALL WORK AT THE FORGE
WITH JOE OR WHETHER I SHALL TRY FOR ANY DIFFERENT OCCUPATION DOWN IN
THIS COUNTRY OR WHETHER WE SHALL GO AWAY TO A DISTANT PLACE WHERE AN
OPPORTUNITY AWAITS ME WHICH I SET ASIDE WHEN IT WAS OFFERED UNTIL I
KNEW YOUR ANSWER AND NOW DEAR BIDDY IF YOU CAN TELL ME THAT YOU WILL
GO THROUGH THE WORLD WITH ME YOU WILL SURELY MAKE IT A BETTER WORLD
FOR ME AND ME A BETTER MAN FOR IT AND I WILL TRY HARD TO MAKE IT A
BETTER WORLD FOR YOU

SUCH WAS MY PURPOSE AFTER THREE DAYS MORE OF RECOVERY I WENT DOWN TO
THE OLD PLACE TO PUT IT IN EXECUTION AND HOW I SPED IN IT IS ALL I
HAVE LEFT TO TELL




CHAPTER LVIII


THE TIDINGS OF MY HIGH FORTUNES HAVING HAD A HEAVY FALL HAD GOT DOWN TO
MY NATIVE PLACE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD BEFORE I GOT THERE I FOUND THE
BLUE BOAR IN POSSESSION OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND I FOUND THAT IT MADE A
GREAT CHANGE IN THE BOARS DEMEANOUR WHEREAS THE BOAR HAD CULTIVATED
MY GOOD OPINION WITH WARM ASSIDUITY WHEN I WAS COMING INTO PROPERTY
THE BOAR WAS EXCEEDINGLY COOL ON THE SUBJECT NOW THAT I WAS GOING OUT
OF PROPERTY

IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED MUCH FATIGUED BY THE JOURNEY I HAD SO
OFTEN MADE SO EASILY THE BOAR COULD NOT PUT ME INTO MY USUAL BEDROOM
WHICH WAS ENGAGED PROBABLY BY SOME ONE WHO HAD EXPECTATIONS AND
COULD ONLY ASSIGN ME A VERY INDIFFERENT CHAMBER AMONG THE PIGEONS AND
POSTCHAISES UP THE YARD BUT I HAD AS SOUND A SLEEP IN THAT LODGING AS
IN THE MOST SUPERIOR ACCOMMODATION THE BOAR COULD HAVE GIVEN ME AND
THE QUALITY OF MY DREAMS WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS IN THE BEST BEDROOM

EARLY IN THE MORNING WHILE MY BREAKFAST WAS GETTING READY I STROLLED
ROUND BY SATIS HOUSE THERE WERE PRINTED BILLS ON THE GATE AND ON BITS
OF CARPET HANGING OUT OF THE WINDOWS ANNOUNCING A SALE BY AUCTION OF
THE HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE AND EFFECTS NEXT WEEK THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS TO
BE SOLD AS OLD BUILDING MATERIALS AND PULLED DOWN LOT 1 WAS MARKED IN
WHITEWASHED KNOCKKNEE LETTERS ON THE BREW HOUSE LOT 2 ON THAT PART OF
THE MAIN BUILDING WHICH HAD BEEN SO LONG SHUT UP OTHER LOTS WERE
MARKED OFF ON OTHER PARTS OF THE STRUCTURE AND THE IVY HAD BEEN TORN
DOWN TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE INSCRIPTIONS AND MUCH OF IT TRAILED LOW IN
THE DUST AND WAS WITHERED ALREADY STEPPING IN FOR A MOMENT AT THE OPEN
GATE AND LOOKING AROUND ME WITH THE UNCOMFORTABLE AIR OF A STRANGER
WHO HAD NO BUSINESS THERE I SAW THE AUCTIONEERS CLERK WALKING ON THE
CASKS AND TELLING THEM OFF FOR THE INFORMATION OF A CATALOGUECOMPILER
PEN IN HAND WHO MADE A TEMPORARY DESK OF THE WHEELED CHAIR I HAD SO
OFTEN PUSHED ALONG TO THE TUNE OF OLD CLEM

WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY BREAKFAST IN THE BOARS COFFEEROOM I FOUND MR
PUMBLECHOOK CONVERSING WITH THE LANDLORD MR PUMBLECHOOK NOT IMPROVED
IN APPEARANCE BY HIS LATE NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE WAS WAITING FOR ME AND
ADDRESSED ME IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS

YOUNG MAN I AM SORRY TO SEE YOU BROUGHT LOW BUT WHAT ELSE COULD BE
EXPECTED WHAT ELSE COULD BE EXPECTED

AS HE EXTENDED HIS HAND WITH A MAGNIFICENTLY FORGIVING AIR AND AS I
WAS BROKEN BY ILLNESS AND UNFIT TO QUARREL I TOOK IT

WILLIAM SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK TO THE WAITER PUT A MUFFIN ON TABLE
AND HAS IT COME TO THIS HAS IT COME TO THIS

I FROWNINGLY SAT DOWN TO MY BREAKFAST MR PUMBLECHOOK STOOD OVER ME
AND POURED OUT MY TEABEFORE I COULD TOUCH THE TEAPOTWITH THE AIR OF A
BENEFACTOR WHO WAS RESOLVED TO BE TRUE TO THE LAST

WILLIAM SAID MR PUMBLECHOOK MOURNFULLY PUT THE SALT ON IN
HAPPIER TIMES ADDRESSING ME I THINK YOU TOOK SUGAR AND DID YOU
TAKE MILK YOU DID SUGAR AND MILK WILLIAM BRING A WATERCRESS

THANK YOU SAID I SHORTLY BUT I DONT EAT WATERCRESSES

YOU DONT EAT EM RETURNED MR PUMBLECHOOK SIGHING AND NODDING HIS
HEAD SEVERAL TIMES AS IF HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED THAT AND AS IF
ABSTINENCE FROM WATERCRESSES WERE CONSISTENT WITH MY DOWNFALL TRUE
THE SIMPLE FRUITS OF THE EARTH NO YOU NEEDNT BRING ANY WILLIAM

I WENT ON WITH MY BREAKFAST AND MR PUMBLECHOOK CONTINUED TO STAND
OVER ME STARING FISHILY AND BREATHING NOISILY AS HE ALWAYS DID

LITTLE MORE THAN SKIN AND BONE MUSED MR PUMBLECHOOK ALOUD AND
YET WHEN HE WENT FROM HERE I MAY SAY WITH MY BLESSING AND I SPREAD
AFORE HIM MY HUMBLE STORE LIKE THE BEE HE WAS AS PLUMP AS A PEACH

THIS REMINDED ME OF THE WONDERFUL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERVILE MANNER
IN WHICH HE HAD OFFERED HIS HAND IN MY NEW PROSPERITY SAYING MAY I
AND THE OSTENTATIOUS CLEMENCY WITH WHICH HE HAD JUST NOW EXHIBITED THE
SAME FAT FIVE FINGERS

HAH HE WENT ON HANDING ME THE BREAD AND BUTTER AND AIR YOU
AGOING TO JOSEPH

IN HEAVENS NAME SAID I FIRING IN SPITE OF MYSELF WHAT DOES IT
MATTER TO YOU WHERE I AM GOING LEAVE THAT TEAPOT ALONE

IT WAS THE WORST COURSE I COULD HAVE TAKEN BECAUSE IT GAVE PUMBLECHOOK
THE OPPORTUNITY HE WANTED

YES YOUNG MAN SAID HE RELEASING THE HANDLE OF THE ARTICLE IN
QUESTION RETIRING A STEP OR TWO FROM MY TABLE AND SPEAKING FOR THE
BEHOOF OF THE LANDLORD AND WAITER AT THE DOOR I WILL LEAVE THAT
TEAPOT ALONE YOU ARE RIGHT YOUNG MAN FOR ONCE YOU ARE RIGHT I
FORGIT MYSELF WHEN I TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST IN YOUR BREAKFAST AS TO
WISH YOUR FRAME EXHAUSTED BY THE DEBILITATING EFFECTS OF
PRODIGYGALITY TO BE STIMILATED BY THE OLESOME NOURISHMENT OF YOUR
FOREFATHERS AND YET SAID PUMBLECHOOK TURNING TO THE LANDLORD AND
WAITER AND POINTING ME OUT AT ARMS LENGTH THIS IS HIM AS I EVER
SPORTED WITH IN HIS DAYS OF HAPPY INFANCY TELL ME NOT IT CANNOT BE I
TELL YOU THIS IS HIM

A LOW MURMUR FROM THE TWO REPLIED THE WAITER APPEARED TO BE
PARTICULARLY AFFECTED

THIS IS HIM SAID PUMBLECHOOK AS I HAVE RODE IN MY SHAYCART THIS
IS HIM AS I HAVE SEEN BROUGHT UP BY HAND THIS IS HIM UNTOE THE SISTER
OF WHICH I WAS UNCLE BY MARRIAGE AS HER NAME WAS GEORGIANA MRIA FROM
HER OWN MOTHER LET HIM DENY IT IF HE CAN

THE WAITER SEEMED CONVINCED THAT I COULD NOT DENY IT AND THAT IT GAVE
THE CASE A BLACK LOOK

YOUNG MAN SAID PUMBLECHOOK SCREWING HIS HEAD AT ME IN THE OLD
FASHION YOU AIR AGOING TO JOSEPH WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME YOU ASK
ME WHERE YOU AIR AGOING I SAY TO YOU SIR YOU AIR AGOING TO
JOSEPH

THE WAITER COUGHED AS IF HE MODESTLY INVITED ME TO GET OVER THAT

NOW SAID PUMBLECHOOK AND ALL THIS WITH A MOST EXASPERATING AIR OF
SAYING IN THE CAUSE OF VIRTUE WHAT WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCING AND
CONCLUSIVE I WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO SAY TO JOSEPH HERE IS SQUIRES OF
THE BOAR PRESENT KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN THIS TOWN AND HERE IS
WILLIAM WHICH HIS FATHERS NAME WAS POTKINS IF I DO NOT DECEIVE
MYSELF

YOU DO NOT SIR SAID WILLIAM

IN THEIR PRESENCE PURSUED PUMBLECHOOK I WILL TELL YOU YOUNG MAN
WHAT TO SAY TO JOSEPH SAYS YOU JOSEPH I HAVE THIS DAY SEEN MY
EARLIEST BENEFACTOR AND THE FOUNDER OF MY FORTUNS I WILL NAME NO
NAMES JOSEPH BUT SO THEY ARE PLEASED TO CALL HIM UP TOWN AND I HAVE
SEEN THAT MAN

I SWEAR I DONT SEE HIM HERE SAID I

SAY THAT LIKEWISE RETORTED PUMBLECHOOK SAY YOU SAID THAT AND EVEN
JOSEPH WILL PROBABLY BETRAY SURPRISE

THERE YOU QUITE MISTAKE HIM SAID I I KNOW BETTER

SAYS YOU PUMBLECHOOK WENT ON JOSEPH I HAVE SEEN THAT MAN AND
THAT MAN BEARS YOU NO MALICE AND BEARS ME NO MALICE HE KNOWS YOUR
CHARACTER JOSEPH AND IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PIGHEADEDNESS AND
IGNORANCE AND HE KNOWS MY CHARACTER JOSEPH AND HE KNOWS MY WANT OF
GRATITOODE YES JOSEPH SAYS YOU HERE PUMBLECHOOK SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND HAND AT ME HE KNOWS MY TOTAL DEFICIENCY OF COMMON HUMAN
GRATITOODE HE KNOWS IT JOSEPH AS NONE CAN YOU DO NOT KNOW IT
JOSEPH HAVING NO CALL TO KNOW IT BUT THAT MAN DO

WINDY DONKEY AS HE WAS IT REALLY AMAZED ME THAT HE COULD HAVE THE FACE
TO TALK THUS TO MINE

SAYS YOU JOSEPH HE GAVE ME A LITTLE MESSAGE WHICH I WILL NOW
REPEAT IT WAS THAT IN MY BEING BROUGHT LOW HE SAW THE FINGER OF
PROVIDENCE HE KNOWED THAT FINGER WHEN HE SAW JOSEPH AND HE SAW IT
PLAIN IT PINTED OUT THIS WRITING JOSEPH REWARD OF INGRATITOODE TO
HIS EARLIEST BENEFACTOR AND FOUNDER OF FORTUNS BUT THAT MAN SAID HE
DID NOT REPENT OF WHAT HE HAD DONE JOSEPH NOT AT ALL IT WAS RIGHT TO
DO IT IT WAS KIND TO DO IT IT WAS BENEVOLENT TO DO IT AND HE WOULD
DO IT AGAIN

ITS PITY SAID I SCORNFULLY AS I FINISHED MY INTERRUPTED
BREAKFAST THAT THE MAN DID NOT SAY WHAT HE HAD DONE AND WOULD DO
AGAIN

SQUIRES OF THE BOAR PUMBLECHOOK WAS NOW ADDRESSING THE LANDLORD
AND WILLIAM I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO YOUR MENTIONING EITHER UP TOWN
OR DOWN TOWN IF SUCH SHOULD BE YOUR WISHES THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO DO
IT KIND TO DO IT BENEVOLENT TO DO IT AND THAT I WOULD DO IT AGAIN

WITH THOSE WORDS THE IMPOSTOR SHOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND WITH AN AIR
AND LEFT THE HOUSE LEAVING ME MUCH MORE ASTONISHED THAN DELIGHTED BY
THE VIRTUES OF THAT SAME INDEFINITE IT I WAS NOT LONG AFTER HIM IN
LEAVING THE HOUSE TOO AND WHEN I WENT DOWN THE HIGH STREET I SAW HIM
HOLDING FORTH NO DOUBT TO THE SAME EFFECT AT HIS SHOP DOOR TO A
SELECT GROUP WHO HONOURED ME WITH VERY UNFAVOURABLE GLANCES AS I
PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY

BUT IT WAS ONLY THE PLEASANTER TO TURN TO BIDDY AND TO JOE WHOSE
GREAT FORBEARANCE SHONE MORE BRIGHTLY THAN BEFORE IF THAT COULD BE
CONTRASTED WITH THIS BRAZEN PRETENDER I WENT TOWARDS THEM SLOWLY FOR
MY LIMBS WERE WEAK BUT WITH A SENSE OF INCREASING RELIEF AS I DREW
NEARER TO THEM AND A SENSE OF LEAVING ARROGANCE AND UNTRUTHFULNESS
FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND

THE JUNE WEATHER WAS DELICIOUS THE SKY WAS BLUE THE LARKS WERE
SOARING HIGH OVER THE GREEN CORN I THOUGHT ALL THAT COUNTRYSIDE MORE
BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL BY FAR THAN I HAD EVER KNOWN IT TO BE YET MANY
PLEASANT PICTURES OF THE LIFE THAT I WOULD LEAD THERE AND OF THE
CHANGE FOR THE BETTER THAT WOULD COME OVER MY CHARACTER WHEN I HAD A
GUIDING SPIRIT AT MY SIDE WHOSE SIMPLE FAITH AND CLEAR HOME WISDOM I
HAD PROVED BEGUILED MY WAY THEY AWAKENED A TENDER EMOTION IN ME FOR
MY HEART WAS SOFTENED BY MY RETURN AND SUCH A CHANGE HAD COME TO PASS
THAT I FELT LIKE ONE WHO WAS TOILING HOME BAREFOOT FROM DISTANT TRAVEL
AND WHOSE WANDERINGS HAD LASTED MANY YEARS

THE SCHOOLHOUSE WHERE BIDDY WAS MISTRESS I HAD NEVER SEEN BUT THE
LITTLE ROUNDABOUT LANE BY WHICH I ENTERED THE VILLAGE FOR QUIETNESS
SAKE TOOK ME PAST IT I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE DAY WAS A
HOLIDAY NO CHILDREN WERE THERE AND BIDDYS HOUSE WAS CLOSED SOME
HOPEFUL NOTION OF SEEING HER BUSILY ENGAGED IN HER DAILY DUTIES
BEFORE SHE SAW ME HAD BEEN IN MY MIND AND WAS DEFEATED

BUT THE FORGE WAS A VERY SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND I WENT TOWARDS IT
UNDER THE SWEET GREEN LIMES LISTENING FOR THE CLINK OF JOES HAMMER
LONG AFTER I OUGHT TO HAVE HEARD IT AND LONG AFTER I HAD FANCIED I
HEARD IT AND FOUND IT BUT A FANCY ALL WAS STILL THE LIMES WERE THERE
AND THE WHITE THORNS WERE THERE AND THE CHESTNUTTREES WERE THERE AND
THEIR LEAVES RUSTLED HARMONIOUSLY WHEN I STOPPED TO LISTEN BUT THE
CLINK OF JOES HAMMER WAS NOT IN THE MIDSUMMER WIND

ALMOST FEARING WITHOUT KNOWING WHY TO COME IN VIEW OF THE FORGE I
SAW IT AT LAST AND SAW THAT IT WAS CLOSED NO GLEAM OF FIRE NO
GLITTERING SHOWER OF SPARKS NO ROAR OF BELLOWS ALL SHUT UP AND
STILL

BUT THE HOUSE WAS NOT DESERTED AND THE BEST PARLOUR SEEMED TO BE IN
USE FOR THERE WERE WHITE CURTAINS FLUTTERING IN ITS WINDOW AND THE
WINDOW WAS OPEN AND GAY WITH FLOWERS I WENT SOFTLY TOWARDS IT MEANING
TO PEEP OVER THE FLOWERS WHEN JOE AND BIDDY STOOD BEFORE ME ARM IN
ARM

AT FIRST BIDDY GAVE A CRY AS IF SHE THOUGHT IT WAS MY APPARITION BUT
IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS IN MY EMBRACE I WEPT TO SEE HER AND SHE
WEPT TO SEE ME I BECAUSE SHE LOOKED SO FRESH AND PLEASANT SHE
BECAUSE I LOOKED SO WORN AND WHITE

BUT DEAR BIDDY HOW SMART YOU ARE

YES DEAR PIP

AND JOE HOW SMART YOU ARE

YES DEAR OLD PIP OLD CHAP

I LOOKED AT BOTH OF THEM FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND THEN

ITS MY WEDDINGDAY CRIED BIDDY IN A BURST OF HAPPINESS AND I AM
MARRIED TO JOE

THEY HAD TAKEN ME INTO THE KITCHEN AND I HAD LAID MY HEAD DOWN ON THE
OLD DEAL TABLE BIDDY HELD ONE OF MY HANDS TO HER LIPS AND JOES
RESTORING TOUCH WAS ON MY SHOULDER WHICH HE WARNT STRONG ENOUGH MY
DEAR FUR TO BE SURPRISED SAID JOE AND BIDDY SAID I OUGHT TO HAVE
THOUGHT OF IT DEAR JOE BUT I WAS TOO HAPPY THEY WERE BOTH SO
OVERJOYED TO SEE ME SO PROUD TO SEE ME SO TOUCHED BY MY COMING TO
THEM SO DELIGHTED THAT I SHOULD HAVE COME BY ACCIDENT TO MAKE THEIR
DAY COMPLETE

MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS ONE OF GREAT THANKFULNESS THAT I HAD NEVER
BREATHED THIS LAST BAFFLED HOPE TO JOE HOW OFTEN WHILE HE WAS WITH ME
IN MY ILLNESS HAD IT RISEN TO MY LIPS HOW IRREVOCABLE WOULD HAVE BEEN

I SOLD ALL I HAD AND PUT ASIDE AS MUCH AS I COULD FOR A COMPOSITION
WITH MY CREDITORSWHO GAVE ME AMPLE TIME TO PAY THEM IN FULLAND I
WENT OUT AND JOINED HERBERT WITHIN A MONTH I HAD QUITTED ENGLAND AND
WITHIN TWO MONTHS I WAS CLERK TO CLARRIKER AND CO AND WITHIN FOUR
MONTHS I ASSUMED MY FIRST UNDIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BEAM ACROSS
THE PARLOUR CEILING AT MILL POND BANK HAD THEN CEASED TO TREMBLE UNDER
OLD BILL BARLEYS GROWLS AND WAS AT PEACE AND HERBERT HAD GONE AWAY TO
MARRY CLARA AND I WAS LEFT IN SOLE CHARGE OF THE EASTERN BRANCH UNTIL
HE BROUGHT HER BACK

MANY A YEAR WENT ROUND BEFORE I WAS A PARTNER IN THE HOUSE BUT I LIVED
HAPPILY WITH HERBERT AND HIS WIFE AND LIVED FRUGALLY AND PAID MY
DEBTS AND MAINTAINED A CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE WITH BIDDY AND JOE IT
WAS NOT UNTIL I BECAME THIRD IN THE FIRM THAT CLARRIKER BETRAYED ME TO
HERBERT BUT HE THEN DECLARED THAT THE SECRET OF HERBERTS PARTNERSHIP
HAD BEEN LONG ENOUGH UPON HIS CONSCIENCE AND HE MUST TELL IT SO HE
TOLD IT AND HERBERT WAS AS MUCH MOVED AS AMAZED AND THE DEAR FELLOW
AND I WERE NOT THE WORSE FRIENDS FOR THE LONG CONCEALMENT I MUST NOT
LEAVE IT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT WE WERE EVER A GREAT HOUSE OR THAT WE
MADE MINTS OF MONEY WE WERE NOT IN A GRAND WAY OF BUSINESS BUT WE HAD
A GOOD NAME AND WORKED FOR OUR PROFITS AND DID VERY WELL WE OWED SO
MUCH TO HERBERTS EVER CHEERFUL INDUSTRY AND READINESS THAT I OFTEN
WONDERED HOW I HAD CONCEIVED THAT OLD IDEA OF HIS INAPTITUDE UNTIL I
WAS ONE DAY ENLIGHTENED BY THE REFLECTION THAT PERHAPS THE INAPTITUDE
HAD NEVER BEEN IN HIM AT ALL BUT HAD BEEN IN ME




CHAPTER LIX


FOR ELEVEN YEARS I HAD NOT SEEN JOE NOR BIDDY WITH MY BODILY
EYESTHOUGH THEY HAD BOTH BEEN OFTEN BEFORE MY FANCY IN THE
EASTWHEN UPON AN EVENING IN DECEMBER AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER DARK I
LAID MY HAND SOFTLY ON THE LATCH OF THE OLD KITCHEN DOOR I TOUCHED IT
SO SOFTLY THAT I WAS NOT HEARD AND LOOKED IN UNSEEN THERE SMOKING
HIS PIPE IN THE OLD PLACE BY THE KITCHEN FIRELIGHT AS HALE AND AS
STRONG AS EVER THOUGH A LITTLE GREY SAT JOE AND THERE FENCED INTO
THE CORNER WITH JOES LEG AND SITTING ON MY OWN LITTLE STOOL LOOKING
AT THE FIRE WASI AGAIN

WE GIV HIM THE NAME OF PIP FOR YOUR SAKE DEAR OLD CHAP SAID JOE
DELIGHTED WHEN I TOOK ANOTHER STOOL BY THE CHILDS SIDE BUT I DID
NOT RUMPLE HIS HAIR AND WE HOPED HE MIGHT GROW A LITTLE BIT LIKE
YOU AND WE THINK HE DO

I THOUGHT SO TOO AND I TOOK HIM OUT FOR A WALK NEXT MORNING AND WE
TALKED IMMENSELY UNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER TO PERFECTION AND I TOOK
HIM DOWN TO THE CHURCHYARD AND SET HIM ON A CERTAIN TOMBSTONE THERE
AND HE SHOWED ME FROM THAT ELEVATION WHICH STONE WAS SACRED TO THE
MEMORY OF PHILIP PIRRIP LATE OF THIS PARISH AND ALSO GEORGIANA WIFE
OF THE ABOVE

BIDDY SAID I WHEN I TALKED WITH HER AFTER DINNER AS HER LITTLE
GIRL LAY SLEEPING IN HER LAP YOU MUST GIVE PIP TO ME ONE OF THESE
DAYS OR LEND HIM AT ALL EVENTS

NO NO SAID BIDDY GENTLY YOU MUST MARRY

SO HERBERT AND CLARA SAY BUT I DONT THINK I SHALL BIDDY I HAVE SO
SETTLED DOWN IN THEIR HOME THAT ITS NOT AT ALL LIKELY I AM ALREADY
QUITE AN OLD BACHELOR

BIDDY LOOKED DOWN AT HER CHILD AND PUT ITS LITTLE HAND TO HER LIPS
AND THEN PUT THE GOOD MATRONLY HAND WITH WHICH SHE HAD TOUCHED IT INTO
MINE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE ACTION AND IN THE LIGHT PRESSURE OF
BIDDYS WEDDINGRING THAT HAD A VERY PRETTY ELOQUENCE IN IT

DEAR PIP SAID BIDDY YOU ARE SURE YOU DONT FRET FOR HER

O NOI THINK NOT BIDDY

TELL ME AS AN OLD OLD FRIEND HAVE YOU QUITE FORGOTTEN HER

MY DEAR BIDDY I HAVE FORGOTTEN NOTHING IN MY LIFE THAT EVER HAD A
FOREMOST PLACE THERE AND LITTLE THAT EVER HAD ANY PLACE THERE BUT
THAT POOR DREAM AS I ONCE USED TO CALL IT HAS ALL GONE BY BIDDYALL
GONE BY

NEVERTHELESS I KNEW WHILE I SAID THOSE WORDS THAT I SECRETLY
INTENDED TO REVISIT THE SITE OF THE OLD HOUSE THAT EVENING ALONE FOR
HER SAKE YES EVEN SO FOR ESTELLAS SAKE

I HAD HEARD OF HER AS LEADING A MOST UNHAPPY LIFE AND AS BEING
SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND WHO HAD USED HER WITH GREAT CRUELTY AND
WHO HAD BECOME QUITE RENOWNED AS A COMPOUND OF PRIDE AVARICE
BRUTALITY AND MEANNESS AND I HAD HEARD OF THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND
FROM AN ACCIDENT CONSEQUENT ON HIS ILLTREATMENT OF A HORSE THIS
RELEASE HAD BEFALLEN HER SOME TWO YEARS BEFORE FOR ANYTHING I KNEW
SHE WAS MARRIED AGAIN

THE EARLY DINNER HOUR AT JOES LEFT ME ABUNDANCE OF TIME WITHOUT
HURRYING MY TALK WITH BIDDY TO WALK OVER TO THE OLD SPOT BEFORE DARK
BUT WHAT WITH LOITERING ON THE WAY TO LOOK AT OLD OBJECTS AND TO THINK
OF OLD TIMES THE DAY HAD QUITE DECLINED WHEN I CAME TO THE PLACE

THERE WAS NO HOUSE NOW NO BREWERY NO BUILDING WHATEVER LEFT BUT THE
WALL OF THE OLD GARDEN THE CLEARED SPACE HAD BEEN ENCLOSED WITH A
ROUGH FENCE AND LOOKING OVER IT I SAW THAT SOME OF THE OLD IVY HAD
STRUCK ROOT ANEW AND WAS GROWING GREEN ON LOW QUIET MOUNDS OF RUIN A
GATE IN THE FENCE STANDING AJAR I PUSHED IT OPEN AND WENT IN

A COLD SILVERY MIST HAD VEILED THE AFTERNOON AND THE MOON WAS NOT YET
UP TO SCATTER IT BUT THE STARS WERE SHINING BEYOND THE MIST AND THE
MOON WAS COMING AND THE EVENING WAS NOT DARK I COULD TRACE OUT WHERE
EVERY PART OF THE OLD HOUSE HAD BEEN AND WHERE THE BREWERY HAD BEEN
AND WHERE THE GATES AND WHERE THE CASKS I HAD DONE SO AND WAS
LOOKING ALONG THE DESOLATE GARDEN WALK WHEN I BEHELD A SOLITARY FIGURE
IN IT

THE FIGURE SHOWED ITSELF AWARE OF ME AS I ADVANCED IT HAD BEEN MOVING
TOWARDS ME BUT IT STOOD STILL AS I DREW NEARER I SAW IT TO BE THE
FIGURE OF A WOMAN AS I DREW NEARER YET IT WAS ABOUT TO TURN AWAY
WHEN IT STOPPED AND LET ME COME UP WITH IT THEN IT FALTERED AS IF
MUCH SURPRISED AND UTTERED MY NAME AND I CRIED OUT

ESTELLA

I AM GREATLY CHANGED I WONDER YOU KNOW ME

THE FRESHNESS OF HER BEAUTY WAS INDEED GONE BUT ITS INDESCRIBABLE
MAJESTY AND ITS INDESCRIBABLE CHARM REMAINED THOSE ATTRACTIONS IN IT
I HAD SEEN BEFORE WHAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE WAS THE SADDENED
SOFTENED LIGHT OF THE ONCE PROUD EYES WHAT I HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE WAS
THE FRIENDLY TOUCH OF THE ONCE INSENSIBLE HAND

WE SAT DOWN ON A BENCH THAT WAS NEAR AND I SAID AFTER SO MANY YEARS
IT IS STRANGE THAT WE SHOULD THUS MEET AGAIN ESTELLA HERE WHERE OUR
FIRST MEETING WAS DO YOU OFTEN COME BACK

I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE SINCE

NOR I

THE MOON BEGAN TO RISE AND I THOUGHT OF THE PLACID LOOK AT THE WHITE
CEILING WHICH HAD PASSED AWAY THE MOON BEGAN TO RISE AND I THOUGHT
OF THE PRESSURE ON MY HAND WHEN I HAD SPOKEN THE LAST WORDS HE HAD
HEARD ON EARTH

ESTELLA WAS THE NEXT TO BREAK THE SILENCE THAT ENSUED BETWEEN US

I HAVE VERY OFTEN HOPED AND INTENDED TO COME BACK BUT HAVE BEEN
PREVENTED BY MANY CIRCUMSTANCES POOR POOR OLD PLACE

THE SILVERY MIST WAS TOUCHED WITH THE FIRST RAYS OF THE MOONLIGHT AND
THE SAME RAYS TOUCHED THE TEARS THAT DROPPED FROM HER EYES NOT KNOWING
THAT I SAW THEM AND SETTING HERSELF TO GET THE BETTER OF THEM SHE
SAID QUIETLY

WERE YOU WONDERING AS YOU WALKED ALONG HOW IT CAME TO BE LEFT IN
THIS CONDITION

YES ESTELLA

THE GROUND BELONGS TO ME IT IS THE ONLY POSSESSION I HAVE NOT
RELINQUISHED EVERYTHING ELSE HAS GONE FROM ME LITTLE BY LITTLE BUT I
HAVE KEPT THIS IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE ONLY DETERMINED RESISTANCE I
MADE IN ALL THE WRETCHED YEARS

IS IT TO BE BUILT ON

AT LAST IT IS I CAME HERE TO TAKE LEAVE OF IT BEFORE ITS CHANGE AND
YOU SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF TOUCHING INTEREST TO A WANDERERYOU
LIVE ABROAD STILL

STILL

AND DO WELL I AM SURE

I WORK PRETTY HARD FOR A SUFFICIENT LIVING AND THEREFOREYES I DO
WELL

I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF YOU SAID ESTELLA

HAVE YOU

OF LATE VERY OFTEN THERE WAS A LONG HARD TIME WHEN I KEPT FAR FROM
ME THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT I HAD THROWN AWAY WHEN I WAS QUITE IGNORANT
OF ITS WORTH BUT SINCE MY DUTY HAS NOT BEEN INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE
ADMISSION OF THAT REMEMBRANCE I HAVE GIVEN IT A PLACE IN MY HEART

YOU HAVE ALWAYS HELD YOUR PLACE IN MY HEART I ANSWERED

AND WE WERE SILENT AGAIN UNTIL SHE SPOKE

I LITTLE THOUGHT SAID ESTELLA THAT I SHOULD TAKE LEAVE OF YOU IN
TAKING LEAVE OF THIS SPOT I AM VERY GLAD TO DO SO

GLAD TO PART AGAIN ESTELLA TO ME PARTING IS A PAINFUL THING TO ME
THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR LAST PARTING HAS BEEN EVER MOURNFUL AND
PAINFUL

BUT YOU SAID TO ME RETURNED ESTELLA VERY EARNESTLY GOD BLESS
YOU GOD FORGIVE YOU AND IF YOU COULD SAY THAT TO ME THEN YOU WILL
NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT TO ME NOWNOW WHEN SUFFERING HAS BEEN
STRONGER THAN ALL OTHER TEACHING AND HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOUR HEART USED TO BE I HAVE BEEN BENT AND BROKEN BUTI HOPEINTO A
BETTER SHAPE BE AS CONSIDERATE AND GOOD TO ME AS YOU WERE AND TELL ME
WE ARE FRIENDS

WE ARE FRIENDS SAID I RISING AND BENDING OVER HER AS SHE ROSE FROM
THE BENCH

AND WILL CONTINUE FRIENDS APART SAID ESTELLA

I TOOK HER HAND IN MINE AND WE WENT OUT OF THE RUINED PLACE AND AS
THE MORNING MISTS HAD RISEN LONG AGO WHEN I FIRST LEFT THE FORGE SO
THE EVENING MISTS WERE RISING NOW AND IN ALL THE BROAD EXPANSE OF
TRANQUIL LIGHT THEY SHOWED TO ME I SAW NO SHADOW OF ANOTHER PARTING
FROM HER
