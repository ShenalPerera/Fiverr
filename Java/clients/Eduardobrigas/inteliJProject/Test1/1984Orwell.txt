CHAPTER 1



IT WAS A BRIGHT COLD DAY IN APRIL AND THE CLOCKS WERE STRIKING THIRTEEN
WINSTON SMITH HIS CHIN NUZZLED INTO HIS BREAST IN AN EFFORT TO ESCAPE THE
VILE WIND SLIPPED QUICKLY THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS OF VICTORY MANSIONS
THOUGH NOT QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT A SWIRL OF GRITTY DUST FROM ENTERING
ALONG WITH HIM

THE HALLWAY SMELT OF BOILED CABBAGE AND OLD RAG MATS AT ONE END OF IT A
COLOURED POSTER TOO LARGE FOR INDOOR DISPLAY HAD BEEN TACKED TO THE WALL
IT DEPICTED SIMPLY AN ENORMOUS FACE MORE THAN A METRE WIDE THE FACE OF A
MAN OF ABOUT FORTYFIVE WITH A HEAVY BLACK MOUSTACHE AND RUGGEDLY HANDSOME
FEATURES WINSTON MADE FOR THE STAIRS IT WAS NO USE TRYING THE LIFT EVEN
AT THE BEST OF TIMES IT WAS SELDOM WORKING AND AT PRESENT THE ELECTRIC
CURRENT WAS CUT OFF DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS IT WAS PART OF THE ECONOMY DRIVE
IN PREPARATION FOR HATE WEEK THE FLAT WAS SEVEN FLIGHTS UP AND WINSTON
WHO WAS THIRTYNINE AND HAD A VARICOSE ULCER ABOVE HIS RIGHT ANKLE WENT
SLOWLY RESTING SEVERAL TIMES ON THE WAY ON EACH LANDING OPPOSITE THE
LIFTSHAFT THE POSTER WITH THE ENORMOUS FACE GAZED FROM THE WALL IT WAS
ONE OF THOSE PICTURES WHICH ARE SO CONTRIVED THAT THE EYES FOLLOW YOU ABOUT
WHEN YOU MOVE BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU THE CAPTION BENEATH IT RAN

INSIDE THE FLAT A FRUITY VOICE WAS READING OUT A LIST OF FIGURES WHICH HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCTION OF PIGIRON THE VOICE CAME FROM AN
OBLONG METAL PLAQUE LIKE A DULLED MIRROR WHICH FORMED PART OF THE SURFACE
OF THE RIGHTHAND WALL WINSTON TURNED A SWITCH AND THE VOICE SANK
SOMEWHAT THOUGH THE WORDS WERE STILL DISTINGUISHABLE THE INSTRUMENT
THE TELESCREEN IT WAS CALLED COULD BE DIMMED BUT THERE WAS NO WAY OF
SHUTTING IT OFF COMPLETELY HE MOVED OVER TO THE WINDOW A SMALLISH FRAIL
FIGURE THE MEAGRENESS OF HIS BODY MERELY EMPHASIZED BY THE BLUE OVERALLS
WHICH WERE THE UNIFORM OF THE PARTY HIS HAIR WAS VERY FAIR HIS FACE
NATURALLY SANGUINE HIS SKIN ROUGHENED BY COARSE SOAP AND BLUNT RAZOR
BLADES AND THE COLD OF THE WINTER THAT HAD JUST ENDED

OUTSIDE EVEN THROUGH THE SHUT WINDOWPANE THE WORLD LOOKED COLD DOWN IN
THE STREET LITTLE EDDIES OF WIND WERE WHIRLING DUST AND TORN PAPER INTO
SPIRALS AND THOUGH THE SUN WAS SHINING AND THE SKY A HARSH BLUE THERE
SEEMED TO BE NO COLOUR IN ANYTHING EXCEPT THE POSTERS THAT WERE PLASTERED
EVERYWHERE THE BLACKMOUSTACHIOD FACE GAZED DOWN FROM EVERY COMMANDING
CORNER THERE WAS ONE ON THE HOUSEFRONT IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE BIG BROTHER
IS WATCHING YOU THE CAPTION SAID WHILE THE DARK EYES LOOKED DEEP INTO
WINSTONS OWN DOWN AT STREET LEVEL ANOTHER POSTER TORN AT ONE CORNER
FLAPPED FITFULLY IN THE WIND ALTERNATELY COVERING AND UNCOVERING THE
SINGLE WORD INGSOC IN THE FAR DISTANCE A HELICOPTER SKIMMED DOWN BETWEEN
THE ROOFS HOVERED FOR AN INSTANT LIKE A BLUEBOTTLE AND DARTED AWAY AGAIN
WITH A CURVING FLIGHT IT WAS THE POLICE PATROL SNOOPING INTO PEOPLES
WINDOWS THE PATROLS DID NOT MATTER HOWEVER ONLY THE THOUGHT POLICE
MATTERED

BEHIND WINSTONS BACK THE VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN WAS STILL BABBLING AWAY
ABOUT PIGIRON AND THE OVERFULFILMENT OF THE NINTH THREEYEAR PLAN THE
TELESCREEN RECEIVED AND TRANSMITTED SIMULTANEOUSLY ANY SOUND THAT WINSTON
MADE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A VERY LOW WHISPER WOULD BE PICKED UP BY IT
MOREOVER SO LONG AS HE REMAINED WITHIN THE FIELD OF VISION WHICH THE METAL
PLAQUE COMMANDED HE COULD BE SEEN AS WELL AS HEARD THERE WAS OF COURSE
NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER YOU WERE BEING WATCHED AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT HOW
OFTEN OR ON WHAT SYSTEM THE THOUGHT POLICE PLUGGED IN ON ANY INDIVIDUAL
WIRE WAS GUESSWORK IT WAS EVEN CONCEIVABLE THAT THEY WATCHED EVERYBODY ALL
THE TIME BUT AT ANY RATE THEY COULD PLUG IN YOUR WIRE WHENEVER THEY WANTED
TO YOU HAD TO LIVEDID LIVE FROM HABIT THAT BECAME INSTINCTIN THE
ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY SOUND YOU MADE WAS OVERHEARD AND EXCEPT IN
DARKNESS EVERY MOVEMENT SCRUTINIZED

WINSTON KEPT HIS BACK TURNED TO THE TELESCREEN IT WAS SAFER THOUGH AS HE
WELL KNEW EVEN A BACK CAN BE REVEALING A KILOMETRE AWAY THE MINISTRY OF
TRUTH HIS PLACE OF WORK TOWERED VAST AND WHITE ABOVE THE GRIMY LANDSCAPE
THIS HE THOUGHT WITH A SORT OF VAGUE DISTASTETHIS WAS LONDON CHIEF
CITY OF AIRSTRIP ONE ITSELF THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS OF THE PROVINCES OF
OCEANIA HE TRIED TO SQUEEZE OUT SOME CHILDHOOD MEMORY THAT SHOULD TELL HIM
WHETHER LONDON HAD ALWAYS BEEN QUITE LIKE THIS WERE THERE ALWAYS THESE
VISTAS OF ROTTING NINETEENTHCENTURY HOUSES THEIR SIDES SHORED UP WITH
BAULKS OF TIMBER THEIR WINDOWS PATCHED WITH CARDBOARD AND THEIR ROOFS
WITH CORRUGATED IRON THEIR CRAZY GARDEN WALLS SAGGING IN ALL DIRECTIONS
AND THE BOMBED SITES WHERE THE PLASTER DUST SWIRLED IN THE AIR AND THE
WILLOWHERB STRAGGLED OVER THE HEAPS OF RUBBLE AND THE PLACES WHERE THE
BOMBS HAD CLEARED A LARGER PATCH AND THERE HAD SPRUNG UP SORDID COLONIES
OF WOODEN DWELLINGS LIKE CHICKENHOUSES BUT IT WAS NO USE HE COULD NOT
REMEMBER NOTHING REMAINED OF HIS CHILDHOOD EXCEPT A SERIES OF BRIGHTLIT
TABLEAUX OCCURRING AGAINST NO BACKGROUND AND MOSTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE

THE MINISTRY OF TRUTHMINITRUE IN NEWSPEAK NEWSPEAK WAS THE OFFICIAL
LANGUAGE OF OCEANIA FOR AN ACCOUNT OF ITS STRUCTURE AND ETYMOLOGY SEE
APPENDIXWAS STARTLINGLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER OBJECT IN SIGHT IT
WAS AN ENORMOUS PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURE OF GLITTERING WHITE CONCRETE SOARING
UP TERRACE AFTER TERRACE 300 METRES INTO THE AIR FROM WHERE WINSTON
STOOD IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE TO READ PICKED OUT ON ITS WHITE FACE IN
ELEGANT LETTERING THE THREE SLOGANS OF THE PARTY


WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH CONTAINED IT WAS SAID THREE THOUSAND ROOMS ABOVE
GROUND LEVEL AND CORRESPONDING RAMIFICATIONS BELOW SCATTERED ABOUT LONDON
THERE WERE JUST THREE OTHER BUILDINGS OF SIMILAR APPEARANCE AND SIZE SO
COMPLETELY DID THEY DWARF THE SURROUNDING ARCHITECTURE THAT FROM THE ROOF
OF VICTORY MANSIONS YOU COULD SEE ALL FOUR OF THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY THEY
WERE THE HOMES OF THE FOUR MINISTRIES BETWEEN WHICH THE ENTIRE APPARATUS
OF GOVERNMENT WAS DIVIDED THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH WHICH CONCERNED ITSELF
WITH NEWS ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION AND THE FINE ARTS THE MINISTRY OF
PEACE WHICH CONCERNED ITSELF WITH WAR THE MINISTRY OF LOVE WHICH
MAINTAINED LAW AND ORDER AND THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS THEIR NAMES IN NEWSPEAK MINITRUE MINIPAX MINILUV
AND MINIPLENTY

THE MINISTRY OF LOVE WAS THE REALLY FRIGHTENING ONE THERE WERE NO WINDOWS
IN IT AT ALL WINSTON HAD NEVER BEEN INSIDE THE MINISTRY OF LOVE NOR
WITHIN HALF A KILOMETRE OF IT IT WAS A PLACE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENTER EXCEPT
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS AND THEN ONLY BY PENETRATING THROUGH A MAZE OF
BARBEDWIRE ENTANGLEMENTS STEEL DOORS AND HIDDEN MACHINEGUN NESTS EVEN
THE STREETS LEADING UP TO ITS OUTER BARRIERS WERE ROAMED BY GORILLAFACED
GUARDS IN BLACK UNIFORMS ARMED WITH JOINTED TRUNCHEONS

WINSTON TURNED ROUND ABRUPTLY HE HAD SET HIS FEATURES INTO THE
EXPRESSION OF QUIET OPTIMISM WHICH IT WAS ADVISABLE TO WEAR WHEN FACING
THE TELESCREEN HE CROSSED THE ROOM INTO THE TINY KITCHEN BY LEAVING
THE MINISTRY AT THIS TIME OF DAY HE HAD SACRIFICED HIS LUNCH IN THE
CANTEEN AND HE WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS NO FOOD IN THE KITCHEN EXCEPT
A HUNK OF DARKCOLOURED BREAD WHICH HAD GOT TO BE SAVED FOR TOMORROWS
BREAKFAST HE TOOK DOWN FROM THE SHELF A BOTTLE OF COLOURLESS LIQUID
WITH A PLAIN WHITE LABEL MARKED VICTORY GIN IT GAVE OFF A SICKLY OILY
SMELL AS OF CHINESE RICESPIRIT WINSTON POURED OUT NEARLY A TEACUPFUL
NERVED HIMSELF FOR A SHOCK AND GULPED IT DOWN LIKE A DOSE OF MEDICINE

INSTANTLY HIS FACE TURNED SCARLET AND THE WATER RAN OUT OF HIS EYES THE
STUFF WAS LIKE NITRIC ACID AND MOREOVER IN SWALLOWING IT ONE HAD THE
SENSATION OF BEING HIT ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH A RUBBER CLUB THE
NEXT MOMENT HOWEVER THE BURNING IN HIS BELLY DIED DOWN AND THE WORLD
BEGAN TO LOOK MORE CHEERFUL HE TOOK A CIGARETTE FROM A CRUMPLED PACKET
MARKED VICTORY CIGARETTES AND INCAUTIOUSLY HELD IT UPRIGHT WHEREUPON THE
TOBACCO FELL OUT ON TO THE FLOOR WITH THE NEXT HE WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL
HE WENT BACK TO THE LIVINGROOM AND SAT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE THAT STOOD
TO THE LEFT OF THE TELESCREEN FROM THE TABLE DRAWER HE TOOK OUT A
PENHOLDER A BOTTLE OF INK AND A THICK QUARTOSIZED BLANK BOOK WITH A
RED BACK AND A MARBLED COVER

FOR SOME REASON THE TELESCREEN IN THE LIVINGROOM WAS IN AN UNUSUAL
POSITION INSTEAD OF BEING PLACED AS WAS NORMAL IN THE END WALL WHERE
IT COULD COMMAND THE WHOLE ROOM IT WAS IN THE LONGER WALL OPPOSITE THE
WINDOW TO ONE SIDE OF IT THERE WAS A SHALLOW ALCOVE IN WHICH WINSTON
WAS NOW SITTING AND WHICH WHEN THE FLATS WERE BUILT HAD PROBABLY BEEN
INTENDED TO HOLD BOOKSHELVES BY SITTING IN THE ALCOVE AND KEEPING WELL
BACK WINSTON WAS ABLE TO REMAIN OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THE TELESCREEN SO
FAR AS SIGHT WENT HE COULD BE HEARD OF COURSE BUT SO LONG AS HE STAYED
IN HIS PRESENT POSITION HE COULD NOT BE SEEN IT WAS PARTLY THE UNUSUAL
GEOGRAPHY OF THE ROOM THAT HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM THE THING THAT HE WAS NOW
ABOUT TO DO

BUT IT HAD ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE BOOK THAT HE HAD JUST TAKEN OUT OF
THE DRAWER IT WAS A PECULIARLY BEAUTIFUL BOOK ITS SMOOTH CREAMY PAPER
A LITTLE YELLOWED BY AGE WAS OF A KIND THAT HAD NOT BEEN MANUFACTURED FOR
AT LEAST FORTY YEARS PAST HE COULD GUESS HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK WAS MUCH
OLDER THAN THAT HE HAD SEEN IT LYING IN THE WINDOW OF A FROWSY LITTLE
JUNKSHOP IN A SLUMMY QUARTER OF THE TOWN JUST WHAT QUARTER HE DID NOT
NOW REMEMBER AND HAD BEEN STRICKEN IMMEDIATELY BY AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE
TO POSSESS IT PARTY MEMBERS WERE SUPPOSED NOT TO GO INTO ORDINARY SHOPS
DEALING ON THE FREE MARKET IT WAS CALLED BUT THE RULE WAS NOT
STRICTLY KEPT BECAUSE THERE WERE VARIOUS THINGS SUCH AS SHOELACES AND
RAZOR BLADES WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HOLD OF IN ANY OTHER WAY HE
HAD GIVEN A QUICK GLANCE UP AND DOWN THE STREET AND THEN HAD SLIPPED INSIDE
AND BOUGHT THE BOOK FOR TWO DOLLARS FIFTY AT THE TIME HE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS
OF WANTING IT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE HE HAD CARRIED IT GUILTILY HOME
IN HIS BRIEFCASE EVEN WITH NOTHING WRITTEN IN IT IT WAS A COMPROMISING
POSSESSION

THE THING THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO WAS TO OPEN A DIARY THIS WAS NOT ILLEGAL
NOTHING WAS ILLEGAL SINCE THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY LAWS BUT IF DETECTED
IT WAS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD BE PUNISHED BY DEATH OR AT LEAST
BY TWENTYFIVE YEARS IN A FORCEDLABOUR CAMP WINSTON FITTED A NIB INTO
THE PENHOLDER AND SUCKED IT TO GET THE GREASE OFF THE PEN WAS AN ARCHAIC
INSTRUMENT SELDOM USED EVEN FOR SIGNATURES AND HE HAD PROCURED ONE
FURTIVELY AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY SIMPLY BECAUSE OF A FEELING THAT THE
BEAUTIFUL CREAMY PAPER DESERVED TO BE WRITTEN ON WITH A REAL NIB INSTEAD
OF BEING SCRATCHED WITH AN INKPENCIL ACTUALLY HE WAS NOT USED TO WRITING
BY HAND APART FROM VERY SHORT NOTES IT WAS USUAL TO DICTATE EVERYTHING
INTO THE SPEAKWRITE WHICH WAS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS PRESENT
PURPOSE HE DIPPED THE PEN INTO THE INK AND THEN FALTERED FOR JUST A
SECOND A TREMOR HAD GONE THROUGH HIS BOWELS TO MARK THE PAPER WAS THE
DECISIVE ACT IN SMALL CLUMSY LETTERS HE WROTE


APRIL 4TH 1984


HE SAT BACK A SENSE OF COMPLETE HELPLESSNESS HAD DESCENDED UPON HIM TO
BEGIN WITH HE DID NOT KNOW WITH ANY CERTAINTY THAT THIS WAS 1984 IT
MUST BE ROUND ABOUT THAT DATE SINCE HE WAS FAIRLY SURE THAT HIS AGE WAS
THIRTYNINE AND HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD BEEN BORN IN 1944 OR 1945 BUT
IT WAS NEVER POSSIBLE NOWADAYS TO PIN DOWN ANY DATE WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO

FOR WHOM IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM TO WONDER WAS HE WRITING THIS DIARY
FOR THE FUTURE FOR THE UNBORN HIS MIND HOVERED FOR A MOMENT ROUND THE
DOUBTFUL DATE ON THE PAGE AND THEN FETCHED UP WITH A BUMP AGAINST THE
NEWSPEAK WORD DOUBLETHINK FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT HE HAD
UNDERTAKEN CAME HOME TO HIM HOW COULD YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUTURE IT
WAS OF ITS NATURE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER THE FUTURE WOULD RESEMBLE THE PRESENT
IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM OR IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM IT
AND HIS PREDICAMENT WOULD BE MEANINGLESS

FOR SOME TIME HE SAT GAZING STUPIDLY AT THE PAPER THE TELESCREEN HAD
CHANGED OVER TO STRIDENT MILITARY MUSIC IT WAS CURIOUS THAT HE SEEMED
NOT MERELY TO HAVE LOST THE POWER OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF BUT EVEN TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO SAY FOR WEEKS
PAST HE HAD BEEN MAKING READY FOR THIS MOMENT AND IT HAD NEVER CROSSED
HIS MIND THAT ANYTHING WOULD BE NEEDED EXCEPT COURAGE THE ACTUAL WRITING
WOULD BE EASY ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO TRANSFER TO PAPER THE INTERMINABLE
RESTLESS MONOLOGUE THAT HAD BEEN RUNNING INSIDE HIS HEAD LITERALLY FOR
YEARS AT THIS MOMENT HOWEVER EVEN THE MONOLOGUE HAD DRIED UP MOREOVER
HIS VARICOSE ULCER HAD BEGUN ITCHING UNBEARABLY HE DARED NOT SCRATCH IT
BECAUSE IF HE DID SO IT ALWAYS BECAME INFLAMED THE SECONDS WERE TICKING
BY HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING EXCEPT THE BLANKNESS OF THE PAGE IN FRONT
OF HIM THE ITCHING OF THE SKIN ABOVE HIS ANKLE THE BLARING OF THE MUSIC
AND A SLIGHT BOOZINESS CAUSED BY THE GIN

SUDDENLY HE BEGAN WRITING IN SHEER PANIC ONLY IMPERFECTLY AWARE OF WHAT
HE WAS SETTING DOWN HIS SMALL BUT CHILDISH HANDWRITING STRAGGLED UP AND
DOWN THE PAGE SHEDDING FIRST ITS CAPITAL LETTERS AND FINALLY EVEN ITS
FULL STOPS


APRIL 4TH 1984 LAST NIGHT TO THE FLICKS ALL WAR FILMS ONE VERY GOOD
ONE OF A SHIP FULL OF REFUGEES BEING BOMBED SOMEWHERE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
AUDIENCE MUCH AMUSED BY SHOTS OF A GREAT HUGE FAT MAN TRYING TO SWIM AWAY
WITH A HELICOPTER AFTER HIM FIRST YOU SAW HIM WALLOWING ALONG IN THE
WATER LIKE A PORPOISE THEN YOU SAW HIM THROUGH THE HELICOPTERS GUNSIGHTS
THEN HE WAS FULL OF HOLES AND THE SEA ROUND HIM TURNED PINK AND HE SANK AS
SUDDENLY AS THOUGH THE HOLES HAD LET IN THE WATER AUDIENCE SHOUTING WITH
LAUGHTER WHEN HE SANK THEN YOU SAW A LIFEBOAT FULL OF CHILDREN WITH A
HELICOPTER HOVERING OVER IT THERE WAS A MIDDLEAGED WOMAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A JEWESS SITTING UP IN THE BOW WITH A LITTLE BOY ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD IN
HER ARMS LITTLE BOY SCREAMING WITH FRIGHT AND HIDING HIS HEAD BETWEEN HER
BREASTS AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO BURROW RIGHT INTO HER AND THE WOMAN PUTTING
HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND COMFORTING HIM ALTHOUGH SHE WAS BLUE WITH FRIGHT
HERSELF ALL THE TIME COVERING HIM UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS IF SHE THOUGHT
HER ARMS COULD KEEP THE BULLETS OFF HIM THEN THE HELICOPTER PLANTED A 20
KILO BOMB IN AMONG THEM TERRIFIC FLASH AND THE BOAT WENT ALL TO MATCHWOOD
THEN THERE WAS A WONDERFUL SHOT OF A CHILDS ARM GOING UP UP UP RIGHT UP
INTO THE AIR A HELICOPTER WITH A CAMERA IN ITS NOSE MUST HAVE FOLLOWED IT
UP AND THERE WAS A LOT OF APPLAUSE FROM THE PARTY SEATS BUT A WOMAN DOWN IN
THE PROLE PART OF THE HOUSE SUDDENLY STARTED KICKING UP A FUSS AND SHOUTING
THEY DIDNT OUGHTER OF SHOWED IT NOT IN FRONT OF KIDS THEY DIDNT IT AINT
RIGHT NOT IN FRONT OF KIDS IT AINT UNTIL THE POLICE TURNED HER TURNED HER
OUT I DONT SUPPOSE ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HER NOBODY CARES WHAT THE PROLES
SAY TYPICAL PROLE REACTION THEY NEVER


WINSTON STOPPED WRITING PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS SUFFERING FROM CRAMP HE DID
NOT KNOW WHAT HAD MADE HIM POUR OUT THIS STREAM OF RUBBISH BUT THE CURIOUS
THING WAS THAT WHILE HE WAS DOING SO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT MEMORY HAD
CLARIFIED ITSELF IN HIS MIND TO THE POINT WHERE HE ALMOST FELT EQUAL TO
WRITING IT DOWN IT WAS HE NOW REALIZED BECAUSE OF THIS OTHER INCIDENT
THAT HE HAD SUDDENLY DECIDED TO COME HOME AND BEGIN THE DIARY TODAY

IT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING AT THE MINISTRY IF ANYTHING SO NEBULOUS COULD
BE SAID TO HAPPEN

IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN HUNDRED AND IN THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT WHERE WINSTON
WORKED THEY WERE DRAGGING THE CHAIRS OUT OF THE CUBICLES AND GROUPING THEM
IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL OPPOSITE THE BIG TELESCREEN IN PREPARATION FOR
THE TWO MINUTES HATE WINSTON WAS JUST TAKING HIS PLACE IN ONE OF THE
MIDDLE ROWS WHEN TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE KNEW BY SIGHT BUT HAD NEVER SPOKEN
TO CAME UNEXPECTEDLY INTO THE ROOM ONE OF THEM WAS A GIRL WHOM HE OFTEN
PASSED IN THE CORRIDORS HE DID NOT KNOW HER NAME BUT HE KNEW THAT SHE
WORKED IN THE FICTION DEPARTMENT PRESUMABLYSINCE HE HAD SOMETIMES SEEN
HER WITH OILY HANDS AND CARRYING A SPANNERSHE HAD SOME MECHANICAL JOB
ON ONE OF THE NOVELWRITING MACHINES SHE WAS A BOLDLOOKING GIRL OF
ABOUT TWENTYSEVEN WITH THICK HAIR A FRECKLED FACE AND SWIFT ATHLETIC
MOVEMENTS A NARROW SCARLET SASH EMBLEM OF THE JUNIOR ANTISEX LEAGUE WAS
WOUND SEVERAL TIMES ROUND THE WAIST OF HER OVERALLS JUST TIGHTLY ENOUGH TO
BRING OUT THE SHAPELINESS OF HER HIPS WINSTON HAD DISLIKED HER FROM THE
VERY FIRST MOMENT OF SEEING HER HE KNEW THE REASON IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE OF HOCKEYFIELDS AND COLD BATHS AND COMMUNITY HIKES AND GENERAL
CLEANMINDEDNESS WHICH SHE MANAGED TO CARRY ABOUT WITH HER HE DISLIKED
NEARLY ALL WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG AND PRETTY ONES IT WAS ALWAYS
THE WOMEN AND ABOVE ALL THE YOUNG ONES WHO WERE THE MOST BIGOTED
ADHERENTS OF THE PARTY THE SWALLOWERS OF SLOGANS THE AMATEUR SPIES AND
NOSERSOUT OF UNORTHODOXY BUT THIS PARTICULAR GIRL GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION
OF BEING MORE DANGEROUS THAN MOST ONCE WHEN THEY PASSED IN THE CORRIDOR
SHE GAVE HIM A QUICK SIDELONG GLANCE WHICH SEEMED TO PIERCE RIGHT INTO
HIM AND FOR A MOMENT HAD FILLED HIM WITH BLACK TERROR THE IDEA HAD EVEN
CROSSED HIS MIND THAT SHE MIGHT BE AN AGENT OF THE THOUGHT POLICE THAT
IT WAS TRUE WAS VERY UNLIKELY STILL HE CONTINUED TO FEEL A PECULIAR
UNEASINESS WHICH HAD FEAR MIXED UP IN IT AS WELL AS HOSTILITY WHENEVER
SHE WAS ANYWHERE NEAR HIM

THE OTHER PERSON WAS A MAN NAMED OBRIEN A MEMBER OF THE INNER PARTY AND
HOLDER OF SOME POST SO IMPORTANT AND REMOTE THAT WINSTON HAD ONLY A DIM
IDEA OF ITS NATURE A MOMENTARY HUSH PASSED OVER THE GROUP OF PEOPLE
ROUND THE CHAIRS AS THEY SAW THE BLACK OVERALLS OF AN INNER PARTY MEMBER
APPROACHING OBRIEN WAS A LARGE BURLY MAN WITH A THICK NECK AND A COARSE
HUMOROUS BRUTAL FACE IN SPITE OF HIS FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE HE HAD A
CERTAIN CHARM OF MANNER HE HAD A TRICK OF RESETTLING HIS SPECTACLES ON
HIS NOSE WHICH WAS CURIOUSLY DISARMINGIN SOME INDEFINABLE WAY CURIOUSLY
CIVILIZED IT WAS A GESTURE WHICH IF ANYONE HAD STILL THOUGHT IN SUCH
TERMS MIGHT HAVE RECALLED AN EIGHTEENTHCENTURY NOBLEMAN OFFERING HIS
SNUFFBOX WINSTON HAD SEEN OBRIEN PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES IN ALMOST AS MANY
YEARS HE FELT DEEPLY DRAWN TO HIM AND NOT SOLELY BECAUSE HE WAS INTRIGUED
BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OBRIENS URBANE MANNER AND HIS PRIZEFIGHTERS
PHYSIQUE MUCH MORE IT WAS BECAUSE OF A SECRETLY HELD BELIEFOR PERHAPS
NOT EVEN A BELIEF MERELY A HOPETHAT OBRIENS POLITICAL ORTHODOXY WAS
NOT PERFECT SOMETHING IN HIS FACE SUGGESTED IT IRRESISTIBLY AND AGAIN
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT EVEN UNORTHODOXY THAT WAS WRITTEN IN HIS FACE BUT
SIMPLY INTELLIGENCE BUT AT ANY RATE HE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING A
PERSON THAT YOU COULD TALK TO IF SOMEHOW YOU COULD CHEAT THE TELESCREEN AND
GET HIM ALONE WINSTON HAD NEVER MADE THE SMALLEST EFFORT TO VERIFY THIS
GUESS INDEED THERE WAS NO WAY OF DOING SO AT THIS MOMENT OBRIEN GLANCED
AT HIS WRISTWATCH SAW THAT IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN HUNDRED AND EVIDENTLY
DECIDED TO STAY IN THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT UNTIL THE TWO MINUTES HATE WAS
OVER HE TOOK A CHAIR IN THE SAME ROW AS WINSTON A COUPLE OF PLACES AWAY
A SMALL SANDYHAIRED WOMAN WHO WORKED IN THE NEXT CUBICLE TO WINSTON WAS
BETWEEN THEM THE GIRL WITH DARK HAIR WAS SITTING IMMEDIATELY BEHIND

THE NEXT MOMENT A HIDEOUS GRINDING SPEECH AS OF SOME MONSTROUS MACHINE
RUNNING WITHOUT OIL BURST FROM THE BIG TELESCREEN AT THE END OF THE ROOM
IT WAS A NOISE THAT SET ONES TEETH ON EDGE AND BRISTLED THE HAIR AT THE
BACK OF ONES NECK THE HATE HAD STARTED

AS USUAL THE FACE OF EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE HAD
FLASHED ON TO THE SCREEN THERE WERE HISSES HERE AND THERE AMONG THE
AUDIENCE THE LITTLE SANDYHAIRED WOMAN GAVE A SQUEAK OF MINGLED FEAR AND
DISGUST GOLDSTEIN WAS THE RENEGADE AND BACKSLIDER WHO ONCE LONG AGO
HOW LONG AGO NOBODY QUITE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADING
FIGURES OF THE PARTY ALMOST ON A LEVEL WITH BIG BROTHER HIMSELF AND
THEN HAD ENGAGED IN COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES HAD BEEN CONDEMNED
TO DEATH AND HAD MYSTERIOUSLY ESCAPED AND DISAPPEARED THE PROGRAMMES
OF THE TWO MINUTES HATE VARIED FROM DAY TO DAY BUT THERE WAS NONE IN
WHICH GOLDSTEIN WAS NOT THE PRINCIPAL FIGURE HE WAS THE PRIMAL TRAITOR
THE EARLIEST DEFILER OF THE PARTYS PURITY ALL SUBSEQUENT CRIMES AGAINST
THE PARTY ALL TREACHERIES ACTS OF SABOTAGE HERESIES DEVIATIONS
SPRANG DIRECTLY OUT OF HIS TEACHING SOMEWHERE OR OTHER HE WAS STILL
ALIVE AND HATCHING HIS CONSPIRACIES PERHAPS SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE SEA
UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HIS FOREIGN PAYMASTERS PERHAPS EVENSO IT WAS
OCCASIONALLY RUMOUREDIN SOME HIDINGPLACE IN OCEANIA ITSELF

WINSTONS DIAPHRAGM WAS CONSTRICTED HE COULD NEVER SEE THE FACE OF
GOLDSTEIN WITHOUT A PAINFUL MIXTURE OF EMOTIONS IT WAS A LEAN JEWISH FACE
WITH A GREAT FUZZY AUREOLE OF WHITE HAIR AND A SMALL GOATEE BEARDA
CLEVER FACE AND YET SOMEHOW INHERENTLY DESPICABLE WITH A KIND OF SENILE
SILLINESS IN THE LONG THIN NOSE NEAR THE END OF WHICH A PAIR OF SPECTACLES
WAS PERCHED IT RESEMBLED THE FACE OF A SHEEP AND THE VOICE TOO HAD A
SHEEPLIKE QUALITY GOLDSTEIN WAS DELIVERING HIS USUAL VENOMOUS ATTACK
UPON THE DOCTRINES OF THE PARTYAN ATTACK SO EXAGGERATED AND PERVERSE THAT
A CHILD SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THROUGH IT AND YET JUST PLAUSIBLE
ENOUGH TO FILL ONE WITH AN ALARMED FEELING THAT OTHER PEOPLE LESS
LEVELHEADED THAN ONESELF MIGHT BE TAKEN IN BY IT HE WAS ABUSING BIG
BROTHER HE WAS DENOUNCING THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PARTY HE WAS DEMANDING
THE IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF PEACE WITH EURASIA HE WAS ADVOCATING FREEDOM
OF SPEECH FREEDOM OF THE PRESS FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
HE WAS CRYING HYSTERICALLY THAT THE REVOLUTION HAD BEEN BETRAYEDAND ALL
THIS IN RAPID POLYSYLLABIC SPEECH WHICH WAS A SORT OF PARODY OF THE
HABITUAL STYLE OF THE ORATORS OF THE PARTY AND EVEN CONTAINED NEWSPEAK
WORDS MORE NEWSPEAK WORDS INDEED THAN ANY PARTY MEMBER WOULD NORMALLY
USE IN REAL LIFE AND ALL THE WHILE LEST ONE SHOULD BE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO
THE REALITY WHICH GOLDSTEINS SPECIOUS CLAPTRAP COVERED BEHIND HIS HEAD ON
THE TELESCREEN THERE MARCHED THE ENDLESS COLUMNS OF THE EURASIAN ARMYROW
AFTER ROW OF SOLIDLOOKING MEN WITH EXPRESSIONLESS ASIATIC FACES WHO SWAM
UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE SCREEN AND VANISHED TO BE REPLACED BY OTHERS
EXACTLY SIMILAR THE DULL RHYTHMIC TRAMP OF THE SOLDIERS BOOTS FORMED THE
BACKGROUND TO GOLDSTEINS BLEATING VOICE

BEFORE THE HATE HAD PROCEEDED FOR THIRTY SECONDS UNCONTROLLABLE
EXCLAMATIONS OF RAGE WERE BREAKING OUT FROM HALF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
THE SELFSATISFIED SHEEPLIKE FACE ON THE SCREEN AND THE TERRIFYING POWER
OF THE EURASIAN ARMY BEHIND IT WERE TOO MUCH TO BE BORNE BESIDES
THE SIGHT OR EVEN THE THOUGHT OF GOLDSTEIN PRODUCED FEAR AND ANGER
AUTOMATICALLY HE WAS AN OBJECT OF HATRED MORE CONSTANT THAN EITHER EURASIA
OR EASTASIA SINCE WHEN OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH ONE OF THESE POWERS IT WAS
GENERALLY AT PEACE WITH THE OTHER BUT WHAT WAS STRANGE WAS THAT ALTHOUGH
GOLDSTEIN WAS HATED AND DESPISED BY EVERYBODY ALTHOUGH EVERY DAY AND A
THOUSAND TIMES A DAY ON PLATFORMS ON THE TELESCREEN IN NEWSPAPERS
IN BOOKS HIS THEORIES WERE REFUTED SMASHED RIDICULED HELD UP TO THE
GENERAL GAZE FOR THE PITIFUL RUBBISH THAT THEY WEREIN SPITE OF ALL THIS
HIS INFLUENCE NEVER SEEMED TO GROW LESS ALWAYS THERE WERE FRESH DUPES
WAITING TO BE SEDUCED BY HIM A DAY NEVER PASSED WHEN SPIES AND SABOTEURS
ACTING UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS WERE NOT UNMASKED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE
HE WAS THE COMMANDER OF A VAST SHADOWY ARMY AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK OF
CONSPIRATORS DEDICATED TO THE OVERTHROW OF THE STATE THE BROTHERHOOD ITS
NAME WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE WERE ALSO WHISPERED STORIES OF A TERRIBLE
BOOK A COMPENDIUM OF ALL THE HERESIES OF WHICH GOLDSTEIN WAS THE AUTHOR
AND WHICH CIRCULATED CLANDESTINELY HERE AND THERE IT WAS A BOOK WITHOUT A
TITLE PEOPLE REFERRED TO IT IF AT ALL SIMPLY AS THE BOOK BUT ONE KNEW
OF SUCH THINGS ONLY THROUGH VAGUE RUMOURS NEITHER THE BROTHERHOOD NOR
THE BOOK WAS A SUBJECT THAT ANY ORDINARY PARTY MEMBER WOULD MENTION IF
THERE WAS A WAY OF AVOIDING IT

IN ITS SECOND MINUTE THE HATE ROSE TO A FRENZY PEOPLE WERE LEAPING UP AND
DOWN IN THEIR PLACES AND SHOUTING AT THE TOPS OF THEIR VOICES IN AN EFFORT
TO DROWN THE MADDENING BLEATING VOICE THAT CAME FROM THE SCREEN THE LITTLE
SANDYHAIRED WOMAN HAD TURNED BRIGHT PINK AND HER MOUTH WAS OPENING AND
SHUTTING LIKE THAT OF A LANDED FISH EVEN OBRIENS HEAVY FACE WAS FLUSHED
HE WAS SITTING VERY STRAIGHT IN HIS CHAIR HIS POWERFUL CHEST SWELLING AND
QUIVERING AS THOUGH HE WERE STANDING UP TO THE ASSAULT OF A WAVE THE
DARKHAIRED GIRL BEHIND WINSTON HAD BEGUN CRYING OUT SWINE SWINE SWINE
AND SUDDENLY SHE PICKED UP A HEAVY NEWSPEAK DICTIONARY AND FLUNG IT AT THE
SCREEN IT STRUCK GOLDSTEINS NOSE AND BOUNCED OFF THE VOICE CONTINUED
INEXORABLY IN A LUCID MOMENT WINSTON FOUND THAT HE WAS SHOUTING WITH THE
OTHERS AND KICKING HIS HEEL VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE RUNG OF HIS CHAIR THE
HORRIBLE THING ABOUT THE TWO MINUTES HATE WAS NOT THAT ONE WAS OBLIGED TO
ACT A PART BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID JOINING
IN WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS ANY PRETENCE WAS ALWAYS UNNECESSARY A HIDEOUS
ECSTASY OF FEAR AND VINDICTIVENESS A DESIRE TO KILL TO TORTURE TO SMASH
FACES IN WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER SEEMED TO FLOW THROUGH THE WHOLE GROUP OF
PEOPLE LIKE AN ELECTRIC CURRENT TURNING ONE EVEN AGAINST ONES WILL INTO
A GRIMACING SCREAMING LUNATIC AND YET THE RAGE THAT ONE FELT WAS AN
ABSTRACT UNDIRECTED EMOTION WHICH COULD BE SWITCHED FROM ONE OBJECT TO
ANOTHER LIKE THE FLAME OF A BLOWLAMP THUS AT ONE MOMENT WINSTONS HATRED
WAS NOT TURNED AGAINST GOLDSTEIN AT ALL BUT ON THE CONTRARY AGAINST
BIG BROTHER THE PARTY AND THE THOUGHT POLICE AND AT SUCH MOMENTS HIS
HEART WENT OUT TO THE LONELY DERIDED HERETIC ON THE SCREEN SOLE GUARDIAN
OF TRUTH AND SANITY IN A WORLD OF LIES AND YET THE VERY NEXT INSTANT HE
WAS AT ONE WITH THE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM AND ALL THAT WAS SAID OF GOLDSTEIN
SEEMED TO HIM TO BE TRUE AT THOSE MOMENTS HIS SECRET LOATHING OF BIG
BROTHER CHANGED INTO ADORATION AND BIG BROTHER SEEMED TO TOWER UP AN
INVINCIBLE FEARLESS PROTECTOR STANDING LIKE A ROCK AGAINST THE HORDES
OF ASIA AND GOLDSTEIN IN SPITE OF HIS ISOLATION HIS HELPLESSNESS AND
THE DOUBT THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS VERY EXISTENCE SEEMED LIKE SOME SINISTER
ENCHANTER CAPABLE BY THE MERE POWER OF HIS VOICE OF WRECKING THE STRUCTURE
OF CIVILIZATION

IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE AT MOMENTS TO SWITCH ONES HATRED THIS WAY OR THAT
BY A VOLUNTARY ACT SUDDENLY BY THE SORT OF VIOLENT EFFORT WITH WHICH ONE
WRENCHES ONES HEAD AWAY FROM THE PILLOW IN A NIGHTMARE WINSTON SUCCEEDED
IN TRANSFERRING HIS HATRED FROM THE FACE ON THE SCREEN TO THE DARKHAIRED
GIRL BEHIND HIM VIVID BEAUTIFUL HALLUCINATIONS FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND
HE WOULD FLOG HER TO DEATH WITH A RUBBER TRUNCHEON HE WOULD TIE HER NAKED
TO A STAKE AND SHOOT HER FULL OF ARROWS LIKE SAINT SEBASTIAN HE WOULD
RAVISH HER AND CUT HER THROAT AT THE MOMENT OF CLIMAX BETTER THAN BEFORE
MOREOVER HE REALIZED WHY IT WAS THAT HE HATED HER HE HATED HER BECAUSE
SHE WAS YOUNG AND PRETTY AND SEXLESS BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GO TO BED WITH
HER AND WOULD NEVER DO SO BECAUSE ROUND HER SWEET SUPPLE WAIST WHICH
SEEMED TO ASK YOU TO ENCIRCLE IT WITH YOUR ARM THERE WAS ONLY THE ODIOUS
SCARLET SASH AGGRESSIVE SYMBOL OF CHASTITY

THE HATE ROSE TO ITS CLIMAX THE VOICE OF GOLDSTEIN HAD BECOME AN ACTUAL
SHEEPS BLEAT AND FOR AN INSTANT THE FACE CHANGED INTO THAT OF A SHEEP
THEN THE SHEEPFACE MELTED INTO THE FIGURE OF A EURASIAN SOLDIER WHO SEEMED
TO BE ADVANCING HUGE AND TERRIBLE HIS SUBMACHINE GUN ROARING AND
SEEMING TO SPRING OUT OF THE SURFACE OF THE SCREEN SO THAT SOME OF THE
PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW ACTUALLY FLINCHED BACKWARDS IN THEIR SEATS BUT
IN THE SAME MOMENT DRAWING A DEEP SIGH OF RELIEF FROM EVERYBODY THE
HOSTILE FIGURE MELTED INTO THE FACE OF BIG BROTHER BLACKHAIRED
BLACKMOUSTACHIOD FULL OF POWER AND MYSTERIOUS CALM AND SO VAST THAT
IT ALMOST FILLED UP THE SCREEN NOBODY HEARD WHAT BIG BROTHER WAS SAYING
IT WAS MERELY A FEW WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT THE SORT OF WORDS THAT ARE
UTTERED IN THE DIN OF BATTLE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE INDIVIDUALLY BUT
RESTORING CONFIDENCE BY THE FACT OF BEING SPOKEN THEN THE FACE OF BIG
BROTHER FADED AWAY AGAIN AND INSTEAD THE THREE SLOGANS OF THE PARTY STOOD
OUT IN BOLD CAPITALS


WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


BUT THE FACE OF BIG BROTHER SEEMED TO PERSIST FOR SEVERAL SECONDS ON THE
SCREEN AS THOUGH THE IMPACT THAT IT HAD MADE ON EVERYONES EYEBALLS WAS
TOO VIVID TO WEAR OFF IMMEDIATELY THE LITTLE SANDYHAIRED WOMAN HAD FLUNG
HERSELF FORWARD OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR IN FRONT OF HER WITH A
TREMULOUS MURMUR THAT SOUNDED LIKE MY SAVIOUR SHE EXTENDED HER ARMS
TOWARDS THE SCREEN THEN SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDS IT WAS APPARENT
THAT SHE WAS UTTERING A PRAYER

AT THIS MOMENT THE ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE BROKE INTO A DEEP SLOW
RHYTHMICAL CHANT OF BBBBOVER AND OVER AGAIN VERY SLOWLY WITH A
LONG PAUSE BETWEEN THE FIRST B AND THE SECONDA HEAVY MURMUROUS SOUND
SOMEHOW CURIOUSLY SAVAGE IN THE BACKGROUND OF WHICH ONE SEEMED TO HEAR THE
STAMP OF NAKED FEET AND THE THROBBING OF TOMTOMS FOR PERHAPS AS MUCH AS
THIRTY SECONDS THEY KEPT IT UP IT WAS A REFRAIN THAT WAS OFTEN HEARD IN
MOMENTS OF OVERWHELMING EMOTION PARTLY IT WAS A SORT OF HYMN TO THE WISDOM
AND MAJESTY OF BIG BROTHER BUT STILL MORE IT WAS AN ACT OF SELFHYPNOSIS
A DELIBERATE DROWNING OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY MEANS OF RHYTHMIC NOISE
WINSTONS ENTRAILS SEEMED TO GROW COLD IN THE TWO MINUTES HATE HE COULD
NOT HELP SHARING IN THE GENERAL DELIRIUM BUT THIS SUBHUMAN CHANTING OF
BBBB ALWAYS FILLED HIM WITH HORROR OF COURSE HE CHANTED WITH THE
REST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO OTHERWISE TO DISSEMBLE YOUR FEELINGS TO
CONTROL YOUR FACE TO DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOING WAS AN INSTINCTIVE
REACTION BUT THERE WAS A SPACE OF A COUPLE OF SECONDS DURING WHICH THE
EXPRESSION OF HIS EYES MIGHT CONCEIVABLY HAVE BETRAYED HIM AND IT WAS
EXACTLY AT THIS MOMENT THAT THE SIGNIFICANT THING HAPPENEDIF INDEED
IT DID HAPPEN

MOMENTARILY HE CAUGHT OBRIENS EYE OBRIEN HAD STOOD UP HE HAD TAKEN
OFF HIS SPECTACLES AND WAS IN THE ACT OF RESETTLING THEM ON HIS NOSE WITH
HIS CHARACTERISTIC GESTURE BUT THERE WAS A FRACTION OF A SECOND WHEN
THEIR EYES MET AND FOR AS LONG AS IT TOOK TO HAPPEN WINSTON KNEWYES HE
KNEWTHAT OBRIEN WAS THINKING THE SAME THING AS HIMSELF AN UNMISTAKABLE
MESSAGE HAD PASSED IT WAS AS THOUGH THEIR TWO MINDS HAD OPENED AND THE
THOUGHTS WERE FLOWING FROM ONE INTO THE OTHER THROUGH THEIR EYES I AM
WITH YOU OBRIEN SEEMED TO BE SAYING TO HIM I KNOW PRECISELY WHAT YOU
ARE FEELING I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR CONTEMPT YOUR HATRED YOUR DISGUST
BUT DONT WORRY I AM ON YOUR SIDE AND THEN THE FLASH OF INTELLIGENCE
WAS GONE AND OBRIENS FACE WAS AS INSCRUTABLE AS EVERYBODY ELSES

THAT WAS ALL AND HE WAS ALREADY UNCERTAIN WHETHER IT HAD HAPPENED SUCH
INCIDENTS NEVER HAD ANY SEQUEL ALL THAT THEY DID WAS TO KEEP ALIVE IN HIM
THE BELIEF OR HOPE THAT OTHERS BESIDES HIMSELF WERE THE ENEMIES OF THE
PARTY PERHAPS THE RUMOURS OF VAST UNDERGROUND CONSPIRACIES WERE TRUE AFTER
ALLPERHAPS THE BROTHERHOOD REALLY EXISTED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN SPITE
OF THE ENDLESS ARRESTS AND CONFESSIONS AND EXECUTIONS TO BE SURE THAT THE
BROTHERHOOD WAS NOT SIMPLY A MYTH SOME DAYS HE BELIEVED IN IT SOME DAYS
NOT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE ONLY FLEETING GLIMPSES THAT MIGHT MEAN ANYTHING
OR NOTHING SNATCHES OF OVERHEARD CONVERSATION FAINT SCRIBBLES ON LAVATORY
WALLSONCE EVEN WHEN TWO STRANGERS MET A SMALL MOVEMENT OF THE HAND
WHICH HAD LOOKED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT BE A SIGNAL OF RECOGNITION IT WAS ALL
GUESSWORK VERY LIKELY HE HAD IMAGINED EVERYTHING HE HAD GONE BACK TO HIS
CUBICLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT OBRIEN AGAIN THE IDEA OF FOLLOWING UP THEIR
MOMENTARY CONTACT HARDLY CROSSED HIS MIND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLY
DANGEROUS EVEN IF HE HAD KNOWN HOW TO SET ABOUT DOING IT FOR A SECOND TWO
SECONDS THEY HAD EXCHANGED AN EQUIVOCAL GLANCE AND THAT WAS THE END OF
THE STORY BUT EVEN THAT WAS A MEMORABLE EVENT IN THE LOCKED LONELINESS IN
WHICH ONE HAD TO LIVE

WINSTON ROUSED HIMSELF AND SAT UP STRAIGHTER HE LET OUT A BELCH THE GIN
WAS RISING FROM HIS STOMACH

HIS EYES REFOCUSED ON THE PAGE HE DISCOVERED THAT WHILE HE SAT HELPLESSLY
MUSING HE HAD ALSO BEEN WRITING AS THOUGH BY AUTOMATIC ACTION AND IT WAS
NO LONGER THE SAME CRAMPED AWKWARD HANDWRITING AS BEFORE HIS PEN HAD SLID
VOLUPTUOUSLY OVER THE SMOOTH PAPER PRINTING IN LARGE NEAT CAPITALS


DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER


OVER AND OVER AGAIN FILLING HALF A PAGE

HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING A TWINGE OF PANIC IT WAS ABSURD SINCE THE
WRITING OF THOSE PARTICULAR WORDS WAS NOT MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE INITIAL
ACT OF OPENING THE DIARY BUT FOR A MOMENT HE WAS TEMPTED TO TEAR OUT THE
SPOILED PAGES AND ABANDON THE ENTERPRISE ALTOGETHER

HE DID NOT DO SO HOWEVER BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IT WAS USELESS WHETHER HE
WROTE DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER OR WHETHER HE REFRAINED FROM WRITING IT MADE
NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER HE WENT ON WITH THE DIARY OR WHETHER HE DID NOT GO
ON WITH IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THE THOUGHT POLICE WOULD GET HIM JUST THE
SAME HE HAD COMMITTEDWOULD STILL HAVE COMMITTED EVEN IF HE HAD NEVER
SET PEN TO PAPERTHE ESSENTIAL CRIME THAT CONTAINED ALL OTHERS IN ITSELF
THOUGHTCRIME THEY CALLED IT THOUGHTCRIME WAS NOT A THING THAT COULD BE
CONCEALED FOR EVER YOU MIGHT DODGE SUCCESSFULLY FOR A WHILE EVEN FOR
YEARS BUT SOONER OR LATER THEY WERE BOUND TO GET YOU

IT WAS ALWAYS AT NIGHTTHE ARRESTS INVARIABLY HAPPENED AT NIGHT THE
SUDDEN JERK OUT OF SLEEP THE ROUGH HAND SHAKING YOUR SHOULDER THE LIGHTS
GLARING IN YOUR EYES THE RING OF HARD FACES ROUND THE BED IN THE VAST
MAJORITY OF CASES THERE WAS NO TRIAL NO REPORT OF THE ARREST PEOPLE
SIMPLY DISAPPEARED ALWAYS DURING THE NIGHT YOUR NAME WAS REMOVED FROM THE
REGISTERS EVERY RECORD OF EVERYTHING YOU HAD EVER DONE WAS WIPED OUT YOUR
ONETIME EXISTENCE WAS DENIED AND THEN FORGOTTEN YOU WERE ABOLISHED
ANNIHILATED VAPORIZED WAS THE USUAL WORD

FOR A MOMENT HE WAS SEIZED BY A KIND OF HYSTERIA HE BEGAN WRITING IN A
HURRIED UNTIDY SCRAWL


THEYLL SHOOT ME I DONT CARE THEYLL SHOOT ME IN THE BACK OF THE NECK I
DONT CARE DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER THEY ALWAYS SHOOT YOU IN THE BACK OF THE
NECK I DONT CARE DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER


HE SAT BACK IN HIS CHAIR SLIGHTLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AND LAID DOWN
THE PEN THE NEXT MOMENT HE STARTED VIOLENTLY THERE WAS A KNOCKING AT
THE DOOR

ALREADY HE SAT AS STILL AS A MOUSE IN THE FUTILE HOPE THAT WHOEVER IT WAS
MIGHT GO AWAY AFTER A SINGLE ATTEMPT BUT NO THE KNOCKING WAS REPEATED
THE WORST THING OF ALL WOULD BE TO DELAY HIS HEART WAS THUMPING LIKE A
DRUM BUT HIS FACE FROM LONG HABIT WAS PROBABLY EXPRESSIONLESS HE GOT
UP AND MOVED HEAVILY TOWARDS THE DOOR




CHAPTER 2



AS HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE DOORKNOB WINSTON SAW THAT HE HAD LEFT THE
DIARY OPEN ON THE TABLE DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER WAS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT
IN LETTERS ALMOST BIG ENOUGH TO BE LEGIBLE ACROSS THE ROOM IT WAS AN
INCONCEIVABLY STUPID THING TO HAVE DONE BUT HE REALIZED EVEN IN HIS
PANIC HE HAD NOT WANTED TO SMUDGE THE CREAMY PAPER BY SHUTTING THE BOOK
WHILE THE INK WAS WET

HE DREW IN HIS BREATH AND OPENED THE DOOR INSTANTLY A WARM WAVE OF RELIEF
FLOWED THROUGH HIM A COLOURLESS CRUSHEDLOOKING WOMAN WITH WISPY HAIR
AND A LINED FACE WAS STANDING OUTSIDE

OH COMRADE SHE BEGAN IN A DREARY WHINING SORT OF VOICE I THOUGHT I
HEARD YOU COME IN DO YOU THINK YOU COULD COME ACROSS AND HAVE A LOOK AT
OUR KITCHEN SINK ITS GOT BLOCKED UP AND

IT WAS MRS PARSONS THE WIFE OF A NEIGHBOUR ON THE SAME FLOOR MRS WAS
A WORD SOMEWHAT DISCOUNTENANCED BY THE PARTYYOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CALL
EVERYONE COMRADEBUT WITH SOME WOMEN ONE USED IT INSTINCTIVELY SHE WAS
A WOMAN OF ABOUT THIRTY BUT LOOKING MUCH OLDER ONE HAD THE IMPRESSION
THAT THERE WAS DUST IN THE CREASES OF HER FACE WINSTON FOLLOWED HER DOWN
THE PASSAGE THESE AMATEUR REPAIR JOBS WERE AN ALMOST DAILY IRRITATION
VICTORY MANSIONS WERE OLD FLATS BUILT IN 1930 OR THEREABOUTS AND WERE
FALLING TO PIECES THE PLASTER FLAKED CONSTANTLY FROM CEILINGS AND WALLS
THE PIPES BURST IN EVERY HARD FROST THE ROOF LEAKED WHENEVER THERE WAS
SNOW THE HEATING SYSTEM WAS USUALLY RUNNING AT HALF STEAM WHEN IT WAS NOT
CLOSED DOWN ALTOGETHER FROM MOTIVES OF ECONOMY REPAIRS EXCEPT WHAT YOU
COULD DO FOR YOURSELF HAD TO BE SANCTIONED BY REMOTE COMMITTEES WHICH
WERE LIABLE TO HOLD UP EVEN THE MENDING OF A WINDOWPANE FOR TWO YEARS

OF COURSE ITS ONLY BECAUSE TOM ISNT HOME SAID MRS PARSONS VAGUELY

THE PARSONS FLAT WAS BIGGER THAN WINSTONS AND DINGY IN A DIFFERENT
WAY EVERYTHING HAD A BATTERED TRAMPLEDON LOOK AS THOUGH THE
PLACE HAD JUST BEEN VISITED BY SOME LARGE VIOLENT ANIMAL GAMES
IMPEDIMENTAHOCKEYSTICKS BOXINGGLOVES A BURST FOOTBALL A PAIR OF
SWEATY SHORTS TURNED INSIDE OUTLAY ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND ON THE
TABLE THERE WAS A LITTER OF DIRTY DISHES AND DOGEARED EXERCISEBOOKS
ON THE WALLS WERE SCARLET BANNERS OF THE YOUTH LEAGUE AND THE SPIES AND
A FULLSIZED POSTER OF BIG BROTHER THERE WAS THE USUAL BOILEDCABBAGE
SMELL COMMON TO THE WHOLE BUILDING BUT IT WAS SHOT THROUGH BY A SHARPER
REEK OF SWEAT WHICHONE KNEW THIS AT THE FIRST SNIFF THOUGH IT WAS
HARD TO SAY HOWWAS THE SWEAT OF SOME PERSON NOT PRESENT AT THE MOMENT
IN ANOTHER ROOM SOMEONE WITH A COMB AND A PIECE OF TOILET PAPER WAS
TRYING TO KEEP TUNE WITH THE MILITARY MUSIC WHICH WAS STILL ISSUING
FROM THE TELESCREEN

ITS THE CHILDREN SAID MRS PARSONS CASTING A HALFAPPREHENSIVE GLANCE
AT THE DOOR THEY HAVENT BEEN OUT TODAY AND OF COURSE

SHE HAD A HABIT OF BREAKING OFF HER SENTENCES IN THE MIDDLE THE KITCHEN
SINK WAS FULL NEARLY TO THE BRIM WITH FILTHY GREENISH WATER WHICH SMELT
WORSE THAN EVER OF CABBAGE WINSTON KNELT DOWN AND EXAMINED THE ANGLEJOINT
OF THE PIPE HE HATED USING HIS HANDS AND HE HATED BENDING DOWN WHICH WAS
ALWAYS LIABLE TO START HIM COUGHING MRS PARSONS LOOKED ON HELPLESSLY

OF COURSE IF TOM WAS HOME HED PUT IT RIGHT IN A MOMENT SHE SAID
HE LOVES ANYTHING LIKE THAT HES EVER SO GOOD WITH HIS HANDS TOM IS

PARSONS WAS WINSTONS FELLOWEMPLOYEE AT THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH HE WAS
A FATTISH BUT ACTIVE MAN OF PARALYSING STUPIDITY A MASS OF IMBECILE
ENTHUSIASMSONE OF THOSE COMPLETELY UNQUESTIONING DEVOTED DRUDGES ON
WHOM MORE EVEN THAN ON THE THOUGHT POLICE THE STABILITY OF THE PARTY
DEPENDED AT THIRTYFIVE HE HAD JUST BEEN UNWILLINGLY EVICTED FROM THE
YOUTH LEAGUE AND BEFORE GRADUATING INTO THE YOUTH LEAGUE HE HAD MANAGED TO
STAY ON IN THE SPIES FOR A YEAR BEYOND THE STATUTORY AGE AT THE MINISTRY
HE WAS EMPLOYED IN SOME SUBORDINATE POST FOR WHICH INTELLIGENCE WAS NOT
REQUIRED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE WAS A LEADING FIGURE ON THE SPORTS
COMMITTEE AND ALL THE OTHER COMMITTEES ENGAGED IN ORGANIZING COMMUNITY
HIKES SPONTANEOUS DEMONSTRATIONS SAVINGS CAMPAIGNS AND VOLUNTARY
ACTIVITIES GENERALLY HE WOULD INFORM YOU WITH QUIET PRIDE BETWEEN WHIFFS
OF HIS PIPE THAT HE HAD PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT THE COMMUNITY CENTRE EVERY
EVENING FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AN OVERPOWERING SMELL OF SWEAT A SORT OF
UNCONSCIOUS TESTIMONY TO THE STRENUOUSNESS OF HIS LIFE FOLLOWED HIM ABOUT
WHEREVER HE WENT AND EVEN REMAINED BEHIND HIM AFTER HE HAD GONE

HAVE YOU GOT A SPANNER SAID WINSTON FIDDLING WITH THE NUT ON THE
ANGLEJOINT

A SPANNER SAID MRS PARSONS IMMEDIATELY BECOMING INVERTEBRATE I DONT
KNOW IM SURE PERHAPS THE CHILDREN

THERE WAS A TRAMPLING OF BOOTS AND ANOTHER BLAST ON THE COMB AS THE
CHILDREN CHARGED INTO THE LIVINGROOM MRS PARSONS BROUGHT THE SPANNER
WINSTON LET OUT THE WATER AND DISGUSTEDLY REMOVED THE CLOT OF HUMAN HAIR
THAT HAD BLOCKED UP THE PIPE HE CLEANED HIS FINGERS AS BEST HE COULD IN
THE COLD WATER FROM THE TAP AND WENT BACK INTO THE OTHER ROOM

UP WITH YOUR HANDS YELLED A SAVAGE VOICE

A HANDSOME TOUGHLOOKING BOY OF NINE HAD POPPED UP FROM BEHIND THE TABLE
AND WAS MENACING HIM WITH A TOY AUTOMATIC PISTOL WHILE HIS SMALL SISTER
ABOUT TWO YEARS YOUNGER MADE THE SAME GESTURE WITH A FRAGMENT OF WOOD
BOTH OF THEM WERE DRESSED IN THE BLUE SHORTS GREY SHIRTS AND RED
NECKERCHIEFS WHICH WERE THE UNIFORM OF THE SPIES WINSTON RAISED HIS HANDS
ABOVE HIS HEAD BUT WITH AN UNEASY FEELING SO VICIOUS WAS THE BOYS
DEMEANOUR THAT IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A GAME

YOURE A TRAITOR YELLED THE BOY YOURE A THOUGHTCRIMINAL YOURE A
EURASIAN SPY ILL SHOOT YOU ILL VAPORIZE YOU ILL SEND YOU TO THE SALT
MINES

SUDDENLY THEY WERE BOTH LEAPING ROUND HIM SHOUTING TRAITOR AND
THOUGHTCRIMINAL THE LITTLE GIRL IMITATING HER BROTHER IN EVERY
MOVEMENT IT WAS SOMEHOW SLIGHTLY FRIGHTENING LIKE THE GAMBOLLING OF
TIGER CUBS WHICH WILL SOON GROW UP INTO MANEATERS THERE WAS A SORT OF
CALCULATING FEROCITY IN THE BOYS EYE A QUITE EVIDENT DESIRE TO HIT OR
KICK WINSTON AND A CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING VERY NEARLY BIG ENOUGH TO DO SO
IT WAS A GOOD JOB IT WAS NOT A REAL PISTOL HE WAS HOLDING WINSTON THOUGHT

MRS PARSONS EYES FLITTED NERVOUSLY FROM WINSTON TO THE CHILDREN AND BACK
AGAIN IN THE BETTER LIGHT OF THE LIVINGROOM HE NOTICED WITH INTEREST
THAT THERE ACTUALLY WAS DUST IN THE CREASES OF HER FACE

THEY DO GET SO NOISY SHE SAID THEYRE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THEY
COULDNT GO TO SEE THE HANGING THATS WHAT IT IS IM TOO BUSY TO TAKE
THEM AND TOM WONT BE BACK FROM WORK IN TIME

WHY CANT WE GO AND SEE THE HANGING ROARED THE BOY IN HIS HUGE VOICE

WANT TO SEE THE HANGING WANT TO SEE THE HANGING CHANTED THE LITTLE
GIRL STILL CAPERING ROUND

SOME EURASIAN PRISONERS GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES WERE TO BE HANGED IN THE
PARK THAT EVENING WINSTON REMEMBERED THIS HAPPENED ABOUT ONCE A MONTH
AND WAS A POPULAR SPECTACLE CHILDREN ALWAYS CLAMOURED TO BE TAKEN TO SEE
IT HE TOOK HIS LEAVE OF MRS PARSONS AND MADE FOR THE DOOR BUT HE HAD NOT
GONE SIX STEPS DOWN THE PASSAGE WHEN SOMETHING HIT THE BACK OF HIS NECK AN
AGONIZINGLY PAINFUL BLOW IT WAS AS THOUGH A REDHOT WIRE HAD BEEN JABBED
INTO HIM HE SPUN ROUND JUST IN TIME TO SEE MRS PARSONS DRAGGING HER SON
BACK INTO THE DOORWAY WHILE THE BOY POCKETED A CATAPULT

GOLDSTEIN BELLOWED THE BOY AS THE DOOR CLOSED ON HIM BUT WHAT MOST
STRUCK WINSTON WAS THE LOOK OF HELPLESS FRIGHT ON THE WOMANS GREYISH FACE

BACK IN THE FLAT HE STEPPED QUICKLY PAST THE TELESCREEN AND SAT DOWN AT THE
TABLE AGAIN STILL RUBBING HIS NECK THE MUSIC FROM THE TELESCREEN HAD
STOPPED INSTEAD A CLIPPED MILITARY VOICE WAS READING OUT WITH A SORT OF
BRUTAL RELISH A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARMAMENTS OF THE NEW FLOATING FORTRESS
WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ANCHORED BETWEEN ICELAND AND THE FAROE ISLANDS

WITH THOSE CHILDREN HE THOUGHT THAT WRETCHED WOMAN MUST LEAD A LIFE OF
TERROR ANOTHER YEAR TWO YEARS AND THEY WOULD BE WATCHING HER NIGHT
AND DAY FOR SYMPTOMS OF UNORTHODOXY NEARLY ALL CHILDREN NOWADAYS WERE
HORRIBLE WHAT WAS WORST OF ALL WAS THAT BY MEANS OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS
THE SPIES THEY WERE SYSTEMATICALLY TURNED INTO UNGOVERNABLE LITTLE SAVAGES
AND YET THIS PRODUCED IN THEM NO TENDENCY WHATEVER TO REBEL AGAINST THE
DISCIPLINE OF THE PARTY ON THE CONTRARY THEY ADORED THE PARTY AND
EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH IT THE SONGS THE PROCESSIONS THE BANNERS THE
HIKING THE DRILLING WITH DUMMY RIFLES THE YELLING OF SLOGANS THE WORSHIP
OF BIG BROTHERIT WAS ALL A SORT OF GLORIOUS GAME TO THEM ALL THEIR
FEROCITY WAS TURNED OUTWARDS AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF THE STATE AGAINST
FOREIGNERS TRAITORS SABOTEURS THOUGHTCRIMINALS IT WAS ALMOST NORMAL
FOR PEOPLE OVER THIRTY TO BE FRIGHTENED OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND WITH
GOOD REASON FOR HARDLY A WEEK PASSED IN WHICH THE TIMES DID NOT CARRY
A PARAGRAPH DESCRIBING HOW SOME EAVESDROPPING LITTLE SNEAKCHILD HERO
WAS THE PHRASE GENERALLY USEDHAD OVERHEARD SOME COMPROMISING REMARK
AND DENOUNCED ITS PARENTS TO THE THOUGHT POLICE

THE STING OF THE CATAPULT BULLET HAD WORN OFF HE PICKED UP HIS PEN
HALFHEARTEDLY WONDERING WHETHER HE COULD FIND SOMETHING MORE TO WRITE
IN THE DIARY SUDDENLY HE BEGAN THINKING OF OBRIEN AGAIN

YEARS AGOHOW LONG WAS IT SEVEN YEARS IT MUST BEHE HAD DREAMED THAT HE
WAS WALKING THROUGH A PITCHDARK ROOM AND SOMEONE SITTING TO ONE SIDE OF
HIM HAD SAID AS HE PASSED WE SHALL MEET IN THE PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO
DARKNESS IT WAS SAID VERY QUIETLY ALMOST CASUALLYA STATEMENT NOT A
COMMAND HE HAD WALKED ON WITHOUT PAUSING WHAT WAS CURIOUS WAS THAT AT THE
TIME IN THE DREAM THE WORDS HAD NOT MADE MUCH IMPRESSION ON HIM IT WAS
ONLY LATER AND BY DEGREES THAT THEY HAD SEEMED TO TAKE ON SIGNIFICANCE HE
COULD NOT NOW REMEMBER WHETHER IT WAS BEFORE OR AFTER HAVING THE DREAM THAT
HE HAD SEEN OBRIEN FOR THE FIRST TIME NOR COULD HE REMEMBER WHEN HE HAD
FIRST IDENTIFIED THE VOICE AS OBRIENS BUT AT ANY RATE THE IDENTIFICATION
EXISTED IT WAS OBRIEN WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OUT OF THE DARK

WINSTON HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FEEL SUREEVEN AFTER THIS MORNINGS FLASH
OF THE EYES IT WAS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SURE WHETHER OBRIEN WAS A FRIEND
OR AN ENEMY NOR DID IT EVEN SEEM TO MATTER GREATLY THERE WAS A LINK OF
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM MORE IMPORTANT THAN AFFECTION OR PARTISANSHIP
WE SHALL MEET IN THE PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO DARKNESS HE HAD SAID
WINSTON DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANT ONLY THAT IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER IT
WOULD COME TRUE

THE VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN PAUSED A TRUMPET CALL CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL
FLOATED INTO THE STAGNANT AIR THE VOICE CONTINUED RASPINGLY

ATTENTION YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE A NEWSFLASH HAS THIS MOMENT ARRIVED
FROM THE MALABAR FRONT OUR FORCES IN SOUTH INDIA HAVE WON A GLORIOUS
VICTORY I AM AUTHORIZED TO SAY THAT THE ACTION WE ARE NOW REPORTING MAY
WELL BRING THE WAR WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE OF ITS END HERE IS THE
NEWSFLASH

BAD NEWS COMING THOUGHT WINSTON AND SURE ENOUGH FOLLOWING ON A GORY
DESCRIPTION OF THE ANNIHILATION OF A EURASIAN ARMY WITH STUPENDOUS FIGURES
OF KILLED AND PRISONERS CAME THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT AS FROM NEXT WEEK
THE CHOCOLATE RATION WOULD BE REDUCED FROM THIRTY GRAMMES TO TWENTY

WINSTON BELCHED AGAIN THE GIN WAS WEARING OFF LEAVING A DEFLATED FEELING
THE TELESCREENPERHAPS TO CELEBRATE THE VICTORY PERHAPS TO DROWN THE
MEMORY OF THE LOST CHOCOLATECRASHED INTO OCEANIA TIS FOR THEE YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO STAND TO ATTENTION HOWEVER IN HIS PRESENT POSITION HE
WAS INVISIBLE

OCEANIA TIS FOR THEE GAVE WAY TO LIGHTER MUSIC WINSTON WALKED OVER TO
THE WINDOW KEEPING HIS BACK TO THE TELESCREEN THE DAY WAS STILL COLD AND
CLEAR SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY A ROCKET BOMB EXPLODED WITH A DULL REVERBERATING
ROAR ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY OF THEM A WEEK WERE FALLING ON LONDON AT
PRESENT

DOWN IN THE STREET THE WIND FLAPPED THE TORN POSTER TO AND FRO AND THE
WORD INGSOC FITFULLY APPEARED AND VANISHED INGSOC THE SACRED PRINCIPLES
OF INGSOC NEWSPEAK DOUBLETHINK THE MUTABILITY OF THE PAST HE FELT AS
THOUGH HE WERE WANDERING IN THE FORESTS OF THE SEA BOTTOM LOST IN A
MONSTROUS WORLD WHERE HE HIMSELF WAS THE MONSTER HE WAS ALONE THE PAST
WAS DEAD THE FUTURE WAS UNIMAGINABLE WHAT CERTAINTY HAD HE THAT A SINGLE
HUMAN CREATURE NOW LIVING WAS ON HIS SIDE AND WHAT WAY OF KNOWING THAT THE
DOMINION OF THE PARTY WOULD NOT ENDURE FOR EVER LIKE AN ANSWER THE THREE
SLOGANS ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH CAME BACK TO HIM


WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


HE TOOK A TWENTYFIVE CENT PIECE OUT OF HIS POCKET THERE TOO IN TINY
CLEAR LETTERING THE SAME SLOGANS WERE INSCRIBED AND ON THE OTHER FACE OF
THE COIN THE HEAD OF BIG BROTHER EVEN FROM THE COIN THE EYES PURSUED YOU
ON COINS ON STAMPS ON THE COVERS OF BOOKS ON BANNERS ON POSTERS AND ON
THE WRAPPINGS OF A CIGARETTE PACKETEVERYWHERE ALWAYS THE EYES WATCHING
YOU AND THE VOICE ENVELOPING YOU ASLEEP OR AWAKE WORKING OR EATING
INDOORS OR OUT OF DOORS IN THE BATH OR IN BEDNO ESCAPE NOTHING WAS YOUR
OWN EXCEPT THE FEW CUBIC CENTIMETRES INSIDE YOUR SKULL

THE SUN HAD SHIFTED ROUND AND THE MYRIAD WINDOWS OF THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH
WITH THE LIGHT NO LONGER SHINING ON THEM LOOKED GRIM AS THE LOOPHOLES OF A
FORTRESS HIS HEART QUAILED BEFORE THE ENORMOUS PYRAMIDAL SHAPE IT WAS TOO
STRONG IT COULD NOT BE STORMED A THOUSAND ROCKET BOMBS WOULD NOT BATTER
IT DOWN HE WONDERED AGAIN FOR WHOM HE WAS WRITING THE DIARY FOR THE
FUTURE FOR THE PASTFOR AN AGE THAT MIGHT BE IMAGINARY AND IN FRONT OF
HIM THERE LAY NOT DEATH BUT ANNIHILATION THE DIARY WOULD BE REDUCED TO
ASHES AND HIMSELF TO VAPOUR ONLY THE THOUGHT POLICE WOULD READ WHAT HE HAD
WRITTEN BEFORE THEY WIPED IT OUT OF EXISTENCE AND OUT OF MEMORY HOW COULD
YOU MAKE APPEAL TO THE FUTURE WHEN NOT A TRACE OF YOU NOT EVEN AN
ANONYMOUS WORD SCRIBBLED ON A PIECE OF PAPER COULD PHYSICALLY SURVIVE

THE TELESCREEN STRUCK FOURTEEN HE MUST LEAVE IN TEN MINUTES HE HAD TO BE
BACK AT WORK BY FOURTEENTHIRTY

CURIOUSLY THE CHIMING OF THE HOUR SEEMED TO HAVE PUT NEW HEART INTO HIM
HE WAS A LONELY GHOST UTTERING A TRUTH THAT NOBODY WOULD EVER HEAR BUT SO
LONG AS HE UTTERED IT IN SOME OBSCURE WAY THE CONTINUITY WAS NOT BROKEN
IT WAS NOT BY MAKING YOURSELF HEARD BUT BY STAYING SANE THAT YOU CARRIED ON
THE HUMAN HERITAGE HE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE DIPPED HIS PEN AND WROTE


TO THE FUTURE OR TO THE PAST TO A TIME WHEN THOUGHT IS FREE WHEN MEN
ARE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER AND DO NOT LIVE ALONETO A TIME WHEN TRUTH
EXISTS AND WHAT IS DONE CANNOT BE UNDONE
FROM THE AGE OF UNIFORMITY FROM THE AGE OF SOLITUDE FROM THE AGE OF
BIG BROTHER FROM THE AGE OF DOUBLETHINKGREETINGS


HE WAS ALREADY DEAD HE REFLECTED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS ONLY NOW
WHEN HE HAD BEGUN TO BE ABLE TO FORMULATE HIS THOUGHTS THAT HE HAD TAKEN
THE DECISIVE STEP THE CONSEQUENCES OF EVERY ACT ARE INCLUDED IN THE ACT
ITSELF HE WROTE


THOUGHTCRIME DOES NOT ENTAIL DEATH THOUGHTCRIME IS DEATH


NOW HE HAD RECOGNIZED HIMSELF AS A DEAD MAN IT BECAME IMPORTANT TO STAY
ALIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TWO FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND WERE INKSTAINED
IT WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF DETAIL THAT MIGHT BETRAY YOU SOME NOSING ZEALOT
IN THE MINISTRY A WOMAN PROBABLY SOMEONE LIKE THE LITTLE SANDYHAIRED
WOMAN OR THE DARKHAIRED GIRL FROM THE FICTION DEPARTMENT MIGHT START
WONDERING WHY HE HAD BEEN WRITING DURING THE LUNCH INTERVAL WHY HE HAD
USED AN OLDFASHIONED PEN WHAT HE HAD BEEN WRITINGAND THEN DROP A HINT
IN THE APPROPRIATE QUARTER HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND CAREFULLY SCRUBBED
THE INK AWAY WITH THE GRITTY DARKBROWN SOAP WHICH RASPED YOUR SKIN LIKE
SANDPAPER AND WAS THEREFORE WELL ADAPTED FOR THIS PURPOSE

HE PUT THE DIARY AWAY IN THE DRAWER IT WAS QUITE USELESS TO THINK OF
HIDING IT BUT HE COULD AT LEAST MAKE SURE WHETHER OR NOT ITS EXISTENCE HAD
BEEN DISCOVERED A HAIR LAID ACROSS THE PAGEENDS WAS TOO OBVIOUS WITH THE
TIP OF HIS FINGER HE PICKED UP AN IDENTIFIABLE GRAIN OF WHITISH DUST AND
DEPOSITED IT ON THE CORNER OF THE COVER WHERE IT WAS BOUND TO BE SHAKEN
OFF IF THE BOOK WAS MOVED




CHAPTER 3



WINSTON WAS DREAMING OF HIS MOTHER

HE MUST HE THOUGHT HAVE BEEN TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN HIS MOTHER HAD
DISAPPEARED SHE WAS A TALL STATUESQUE RATHER SILENT WOMAN WITH SLOW
MOVEMENTS AND MAGNIFICENT FAIR HAIR HIS FATHER HE REMEMBERED MORE VAGUELY
AS DARK AND THIN DRESSED ALWAYS IN NEAT DARK CLOTHES WINSTON REMEMBERED
ESPECIALLY THE VERY THIN SOLES OF HIS FATHERS SHOES AND WEARING
SPECTACLES THE TWO OF THEM MUST EVIDENTLY HAVE BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN ONE
OF THE FIRST GREAT PURGES OF THE FIFTIES

AT THIS MOMENT HIS MOTHER WAS SITTING IN SOME PLACE DEEP DOWN BENEATH HIM
WITH HIS YOUNG SISTER IN HER ARMS HE DID NOT REMEMBER HIS SISTER AT ALL
EXCEPT AS A TINY FEEBLE BABY ALWAYS SILENT WITH LARGE WATCHFUL EYES
BOTH OF THEM WERE LOOKING UP AT HIM THEY WERE DOWN IN SOME SUBTERRANEAN
PLACETHE BOTTOM OF A WELL FOR INSTANCE OR A VERY DEEP GRAVEBUT IT
WAS A PLACE WHICH ALREADY FAR BELOW HIM WAS ITSELF MOVING DOWNWARDS
THEY WERE IN THE SALOON OF A SINKING SHIP LOOKING UP AT HIM THROUGH THE
DARKENING WATER THERE WAS STILL AIR IN THE SALOON THEY COULD STILL SEE
HIM AND HE THEM BUT ALL THE WHILE THEY WERE SINKING DOWN DOWN INTO THE
GREEN WATERS WHICH IN ANOTHER MOMENT MUST HIDE THEM FROM SIGHT FOR EVER
HE WAS OUT IN THE LIGHT AND AIR WHILE THEY WERE BEING SUCKED DOWN TO DEATH
AND THEY WERE DOWN THERE BECAUSE HE WAS UP HERE HE KNEW IT AND THEY KNEW
IT AND HE COULD SEE THE KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR FACES THERE WAS NO REPROACH
EITHER IN THEIR FACES OR IN THEIR HEARTS ONLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY
MUST DIE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT REMAIN ALIVE AND THAT THIS WAS PART OF
THE UNAVOIDABLE ORDER OF THINGS

HE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT HE KNEW IN HIS DREAM THAT IN
SOME WAY THE LIVES OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER HAD BEEN SACRIFICED TO HIS
OWN IT WAS ONE OF THOSE DREAMS WHICH WHILE RETAINING THE CHARACTERISTIC
DREAM SCENERY ARE A CONTINUATION OF ONES INTELLECTUAL LIFE AND IN WHICH
ONE BECOMES AWARE OF FACTS AND IDEAS WHICH STILL SEEM NEW AND VALUABLE
AFTER ONE IS AWAKE THE THING THAT NOW SUDDENLY STRUCK WINSTON WAS THAT HIS
MOTHERS DEATH NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AGO HAD BEEN TRAGIC AND SORROWFUL IN
A WAY THAT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TRAGEDY HE PERCEIVED BELONGED TO THE
ANCIENT TIME TO A TIME WHEN THERE WAS STILL PRIVACY LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP
AND WHEN THE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY STOOD BY ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT NEEDING TO
KNOW THE REASON HIS MOTHERS MEMORY TORE AT HIS HEART BECAUSE SHE HAD DIED
LOVING HIM WHEN HE WAS TOO YOUNG AND SELFISH TO LOVE HER IN RETURN AND
BECAUSE SOMEHOW HE DID NOT REMEMBER HOW SHE HAD SACRIFICED HERSELF TO A
CONCEPTION OF LOYALTY THAT WAS PRIVATE AND UNALTERABLE SUCH THINGS HE
SAW COULD NOT HAPPEN TODAY TODAY THERE WERE FEAR HATRED AND PAIN BUT
NO DIGNITY OF EMOTION NO DEEP OR COMPLEX SORROWS ALL THIS HE SEEMED TO
SEE IN THE LARGE EYES OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER LOOKING UP AT HIM
THROUGH THE GREEN WATER HUNDREDS OF FATHOMS DOWN AND STILL SINKING

SUDDENLY HE WAS STANDING ON SHORT SPRINGY TURF ON A SUMMER EVENING WHEN
THE SLANTING RAYS OF THE SUN GILDED THE GROUND THE LANDSCAPE THAT HE WAS
LOOKING AT RECURRED SO OFTEN IN HIS DREAMS THAT HE WAS NEVER FULLY CERTAIN
WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD SEEN IT IN THE REAL WORLD IN HIS WAKING THOUGHTS HE
CALLED IT THE GOLDEN COUNTRY IT WAS AN OLD RABBITBITTEN PASTURE WITH A
FOOTTRACK WANDERING ACROSS IT AND A MOLEHILL HERE AND THERE IN THE RAGGED
HEDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FIELD THE BOUGHS OF THE ELM TREES WERE
SWAYING VERY FAINTLY IN THE BREEZE THEIR LEAVES JUST STIRRING IN DENSE
MASSES LIKE WOMENS HAIR SOMEWHERE NEAR AT HAND THOUGH OUT OF SIGHT
THERE WAS A CLEAR SLOWMOVING STREAM WHERE DACE WERE SWIMMING IN THE
POOLS UNDER THE WILLOW TREES

THE GIRL WITH DARK HAIR WAS COMING TOWARDS THEM ACROSS THE FIELD WITH
WHAT SEEMED A SINGLE MOVEMENT SHE TORE OFF HER CLOTHES AND FLUNG THEM
DISDAINFULLY ASIDE HER BODY WAS WHITE AND SMOOTH BUT IT AROUSED NO DESIRE
IN HIM INDEED HE BARELY LOOKED AT IT WHAT OVERWHELMED HIM IN THAT INSTANT
WAS ADMIRATION FOR THE GESTURE WITH WHICH SHE HAD THROWN HER CLOTHES ASIDE
WITH ITS GRACE AND CARELESSNESS IT SEEMED TO ANNIHILATE A WHOLE CULTURE
A WHOLE SYSTEM OF THOUGHT AS THOUGH BIG BROTHER AND THE PARTY AND THE
THOUGHT POLICE COULD ALL BE SWEPT INTO NOTHINGNESS BY A SINGLE SPLENDID
MOVEMENT OF THE ARM THAT TOO WAS A GESTURE BELONGING TO THE ANCIENT TIME
WINSTON WOKE UP WITH THE WORD SHAKESPEARE ON HIS LIPS

THE TELESCREEN WAS GIVING FORTH AN EARSPLITTING WHISTLE WHICH CONTINUED ON
THE SAME NOTE FOR THIRTY SECONDS IT WAS NOUGHT SEVEN FIFTEEN GETTINGUP
TIME FOR OFFICE WORKERS WINSTON WRENCHED HIS BODY OUT OF BEDNAKED FOR
A MEMBER OF THE OUTER PARTY RECEIVED ONLY 3000 CLOTHING COUPONS ANNUALLY
AND A SUIT OF PYJAMAS WAS 600AND SEIZED A DINGY SINGLET AND A PAIR OF
SHORTS THAT WERE LYING ACROSS A CHAIR THE PHYSICAL JERKS WOULD BEGIN IN
THREE MINUTES THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS DOUBLED UP BY A VIOLENT COUGHING FIT
WHICH NEARLY ALWAYS ATTACKED HIM SOON AFTER WAKING UP IT EMPTIED HIS LUNGS
SO COMPLETELY THAT HE COULD ONLY BEGIN BREATHING AGAIN BY LYING ON HIS BACK
AND TAKING A SERIES OF DEEP GASPS HIS VEINS HAD SWELLED WITH THE EFFORT OF
THE COUGH AND THE VARICOSE ULCER HAD STARTED ITCHING

THIRTY TO FORTY GROUP YAPPED A PIERCING FEMALE VOICE THIRTY TO FORTY
GROUP TAKE YOUR PLACES PLEASE THIRTIES TO FORTIES

WINSTON SPRANG TO ATTENTION IN FRONT OF THE TELESCREEN UPON WHICH THE
IMAGE OF A YOUNGISH WOMAN SCRAWNY BUT MUSCULAR DRESSED IN TUNIC AND
GYMSHOES HAD ALREADY APPEARED

ARMS BENDING AND STRETCHING SHE RAPPED OUT TAKE YOUR TIME BY ME ONE
TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR COME ON COMRADES PUT A BIT OF
LIFE INTO IT ONE TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR

THE PAIN OF THE COUGHING FIT HAD NOT QUITE DRIVEN OUT OF WINSTONS MIND THE
IMPRESSION MADE BY HIS DREAM AND THE RHYTHMIC MOVEMENTS OF THE EXERCISE
RESTORED IT SOMEWHAT AS HE MECHANICALLY SHOT HIS ARMS BACK AND FORTH
WEARING ON HIS FACE THE LOOK OF GRIM ENJOYMENT WHICH WAS CONSIDERED PROPER
DURING THE PHYSICAL JERKS HE WAS STRUGGLING TO THINK HIS WAY BACKWARD INTO
THE DIM PERIOD OF HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT
BEYOND THE LATE FIFTIES EVERYTHING FADED WHEN THERE WERE NO EXTERNAL
RECORDS THAT YOU COULD REFER TO EVEN THE OUTLINE OF YOUR OWN LIFE LOST
ITS SHARPNESS YOU REMEMBERED HUGE EVENTS WHICH HAD QUITE PROBABLY NOT
HAPPENED YOU REMEMBERED THE DETAIL OF INCIDENTS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO
RECAPTURE THEIR ATMOSPHERE AND THERE WERE LONG BLANK PERIODS TO WHICH YOU
COULD ASSIGN NOTHING EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DIFFERENT THEN EVEN THE NAMES OF
COUNTRIES AND THEIR SHAPES ON THE MAP HAD BEEN DIFFERENT AIRSTRIP ONE
FOR INSTANCE HAD NOT BEEN SO CALLED IN THOSE DAYS IT HAD BEEN CALLED
ENGLAND OR BRITAIN THOUGH LONDON HE FELT FAIRLY CERTAIN HAD ALWAYS BEEN
CALLED LONDON

WINSTON COULD NOT DEFINITELY REMEMBER A TIME WHEN HIS COUNTRY HAD NOT BEEN
AT WAR BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A FAIRLY LONG INTERVAL OF
PEACE DURING HIS CHILDHOOD BECAUSE ONE OF HIS EARLY MEMORIES WAS OF AN AIR
RAID WHICH APPEARED TO TAKE EVERYONE BY SURPRISE PERHAPS IT WAS THE TIME
WHEN THE ATOMIC BOMB HAD FALLEN ON COLCHESTER HE DID NOT REMEMBER THE RAID
ITSELF BUT HE DID REMEMBER HIS FATHERS HAND CLUTCHING HIS OWN AS THEY
HURRIED DOWN DOWN DOWN INTO SOME PLACE DEEP IN THE EARTH ROUND AND ROUND
A SPIRAL STAIRCASE WHICH RANG UNDER HIS FEET AND WHICH FINALLY SO WEARIED
HIS LEGS THAT HE BEGAN WHIMPERING AND THEY HAD TO STOP AND REST HIS
MOTHER IN HER SLOW DREAMY WAY WAS FOLLOWING A LONG WAY BEHIND THEM SHE
WAS CARRYING HIS BABY SISTEROR PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY A BUNDLE OF BLANKETS
THAT SHE WAS CARRYING HE WAS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER HIS SISTER HAD BEEN BORN
THEN FINALLY THEY HAD EMERGED INTO A NOISY CROWDED PLACE WHICH HE HAD
REALIZED TO BE A TUBE STATION

THERE WERE PEOPLE SITTING ALL OVER THE STONEFLAGGED FLOOR AND OTHER
PEOPLE PACKED TIGHTLY TOGETHER WERE SITTING ON METAL BUNKS ONE ABOVE
THE OTHER WINSTON AND HIS MOTHER AND FATHER FOUND THEMSELVES A PLACE ON
THE FLOOR AND NEAR THEM AN OLD MAN AND AN OLD WOMAN WERE SITTING SIDE BY
SIDE ON A BUNK THE OLD MAN HAD ON A DECENT DARK SUIT AND A BLACK CLOTH CAP
PUSHED BACK FROM VERY WHITE HAIR HIS FACE WAS SCARLET AND HIS EYES WERE
BLUE AND FULL OF TEARS HE REEKED OF GIN IT SEEMED TO BREATHE OUT OF HIS
SKIN IN PLACE OF SWEAT AND ONE COULD HAVE FANCIED THAT THE TEARS WELLING
FROM HIS EYES WERE PURE GIN BUT THOUGH SLIGHTLY DRUNK HE WAS ALSO
SUFFERING UNDER SOME GRIEF THAT WAS GENUINE AND UNBEARABLE IN HIS CHILDISH
WAY WINSTON GRASPED THAT SOME TERRIBLE THING SOMETHING THAT WAS BEYOND
FORGIVENESS AND COULD NEVER BE REMEDIED HAD JUST HAPPENED IT ALSO SEEMED
TO HIM THAT HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS SOMEONE WHOM THE OLD MAN LOVEDA LITTLE
GRANDDAUGHTER PERHAPSHAD BEEN KILLED EVERY FEW MINUTES THE OLD MAN KEPT
REPEATING

WE DIDNT OUGHT TO AVE TRUSTED EM I SAID SO MA DIDNT I THATS WHAT
COMES OF TRUSTING EM I SAID SO ALL ALONG WE DIDNT OUGHT TO AVE TRUSTED
THE BUGGERS

BUT WHICH BUGGERS THEY DIDNT OUGHT TO HAVE TRUSTED WINSTON COULD NOT NOW
REMEMBER

SINCE ABOUT THAT TIME WAR HAD BEEN LITERALLY CONTINUOUS THOUGH STRICTLY
SPEAKING IT HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME WAR FOR SEVERAL MONTHS DURING HIS
CHILDHOOD THERE HAD BEEN CONFUSED STREET FIGHTING IN LONDON ITSELF SOME
OF WHICH HE REMEMBERED VIVIDLY BUT TO TRACE OUT THE HISTORY OF THE WHOLE
PERIOD TO SAY WHO WAS FIGHTING WHOM AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN
UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE SINCE NO WRITTEN RECORD AND NO SPOKEN WORD EVER MADE
MENTION OF ANY OTHER ALIGNMENT THAN THE EXISTING ONE AT THIS MOMENT FOR
EXAMPLE IN 1984 IF IT WAS 1984 OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EURASIA AND
IN ALLIANCE WITH EASTASIA IN NO PUBLIC OR PRIVATE UTTERANCE WAS IT EVER
ADMITTED THAT THE THREE POWERS HAD AT ANY TIME BEEN GROUPED ALONG DIFFERENT
LINES ACTUALLY AS WINSTON WELL KNEW IT WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS SINCE OCEANIA
HAD BEEN AT WAR WITH EASTASIA AND IN ALLIANCE WITH EURASIA BUT THAT WAS
MERELY A PIECE OF FURTIVE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE HAPPENED TO POSSESS BECAUSE
HIS MEMORY WAS NOT SATISFACTORILY UNDER CONTROL OFFICIALLY THE CHANGE OF
PARTNERS HAD NEVER HAPPENED OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EURASIA THEREFORE
OCEANIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH EURASIA THE ENEMY OF THE MOMENT ALWAYS
REPRESENTED ABSOLUTE EVIL AND IT FOLLOWED THAT ANY PAST OR FUTURE
AGREEMENT WITH HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE

THE FRIGHTENING THING HE REFLECTED FOR THE TEN THOUSANDTH TIME AS HE
FORCED HIS SHOULDERS PAINFULLY BACKWARD WITH HANDS ON HIPS THEY WERE
GYRATING THEIR BODIES FROM THE WAIST AN EXERCISE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
GOOD FOR THE BACK MUSCLESTHE FRIGHTENING THING WAS THAT IT MIGHT ALL BE
TRUE IF THE PARTY COULD THRUST ITS HAND INTO THE PAST AND SAY OF THIS OR
THAT EVENT IT NEVER HAPPENEDTHAT SURELY WAS MORE TERRIFYING THAN MERE
TORTURE AND DEATH

THE PARTY SAID THAT OCEANIA HAD NEVER BEEN IN ALLIANCE WITH EURASIA HE
WINSTON SMITH KNEW THAT OCEANIA HAD BEEN IN ALLIANCE WITH EURASIA AS SHORT
A TIME AS FOUR YEARS AGO BUT WHERE DID THAT KNOWLEDGE EXIST ONLY IN HIS
OWN CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IN ANY CASE MUST SOON BE ANNIHILATED AND IF ALL
OTHERS ACCEPTED THE LIE WHICH THE PARTY IMPOSEDIF ALL RECORDS TOLD THE
SAME TALETHEN THE LIE PASSED INTO HISTORY AND BECAME TRUTH WHO CONTROLS
THE PAST RAN THE PARTY SLOGAN CONTROLS THE FUTURE WHO CONTROLS THE
PRESENT CONTROLS THE PAST AND YET THE PAST THOUGH OF ITS NATURE
ALTERABLE NEVER HAD BEEN ALTERED WHATEVER WAS TRUE NOW WAS TRUE FROM
EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING IT WAS QUITE SIMPLE ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS
AN UNENDING SERIES OF VICTORIES OVER YOUR OWN MEMORY REALITY CONTROL
THEY CALLED IT IN NEWSPEAK DOUBLETHINK

STAND EASY BARKED THE INSTRUCTRESS A LITTLE MORE GENIALLY

WINSTON SANK HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES AND SLOWLY REFILLED HIS LUNGS WITH AIR
HIS MIND SLID AWAY INTO THE LABYRINTHINE WORLD OF DOUBLETHINK TO KNOW
AND NOT TO KNOW TO BE CONSCIOUS OF COMPLETE TRUTHFULNESS WHILE TELLING
CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED LIES TO HOLD SIMULTANEOUSLY TWO OPINIONS WHICH
CANCELLED OUT KNOWING THEM TO BE CONTRADICTORY AND BELIEVING IN BOTH OF
THEM TO USE LOGIC AGAINST LOGIC TO REPUDIATE MORALITY WHILE LAYING CLAIM
TO IT TO BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT THE PARTY WAS THE
GUARDIAN OF DEMOCRACY TO FORGET WHATEVER IT WAS NECESSARY TO FORGET THEN
TO DRAW IT BACK INTO MEMORY AGAIN AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS NEEDED AND
THEN PROMPTLY TO FORGET IT AGAIN AND ABOVE ALL TO APPLY THE SAME PROCESS
TO THE PROCESS ITSELF THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE SUBTLETY CONSCIOUSLY TO
INDUCE UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN ONCE AGAIN TO BECOME UNCONSCIOUS OF
THE ACT OF HYPNOSIS YOU HAD JUST PERFORMED EVEN TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD
DOUBLETHINK INVOLVED THE USE OF DOUBLETHINK

THE INSTRUCTRESS HAD CALLED THEM TO ATTENTION AGAIN AND NOW LETS SEE
WHICH OF US CAN TOUCH OUR TOES SHE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY RIGHT OVER
FROM THE HIPS PLEASE COMRADES ONETWO ONETWO

WINSTON LOATHED THIS EXERCISE WHICH SENT SHOOTING PAINS ALL THE WAY FROM
HIS HEELS TO HIS BUTTOCKS AND OFTEN ENDED BY BRINGING ON ANOTHER COUGHING
FIT THE HALFPLEASANT QUALITY WENT OUT OF HIS MEDITATIONS THE PAST HE
REFLECTED HAD NOT MERELY BEEN ALTERED IT HAD BEEN ACTUALLY DESTROYED FOR
HOW COULD YOU ESTABLISH EVEN THE MOST OBVIOUS FACT WHEN THERE EXISTED NO
RECORD OUTSIDE YOUR OWN MEMORY HE TRIED TO REMEMBER IN WHAT YEAR HE HAD
FIRST HEARD MENTION OF BIG BROTHER HE THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AT SOME
TIME IN THE SIXTIES BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CERTAIN IN THE PARTY
HISTORIES OF COURSE BIG BROTHER FIGURED AS THE LEADER AND GUARDIAN OF THE
REVOLUTION SINCE ITS VERY EARLIEST DAYS HIS EXPLOITS HAD BEEN GRADUALLY
PUSHED BACKWARDS IN TIME UNTIL ALREADY THEY EXTENDED INTO THE FABULOUS
WORLD OF THE FORTIES AND THE THIRTIES WHEN THE CAPITALISTS IN THEIR
STRANGE CYLINDRICAL HATS STILL RODE THROUGH THE STREETS OF LONDON IN GREAT
GLEAMING MOTORCARS OR HORSE CARRIAGES WITH GLASS SIDES THERE WAS NO
KNOWING HOW MUCH OF THIS LEGEND WAS TRUE AND HOW MUCH INVENTED WINSTON
COULD NOT EVEN REMEMBER AT WHAT DATE THE PARTY ITSELF HAD COME INTO
EXISTENCE HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE HAD EVER HEARD THE WORD INGSOC BEFORE
1960 BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT IN ITS OLDSPEAK FORMENGLISH SOCIALISM
THAT IS TO SAYIT HAD BEEN CURRENT EARLIER EVERYTHING MELTED INTO MIST
SOMETIMES INDEED YOU COULD PUT YOUR FINGER ON A DEFINITE LIE IT WAS NOT
TRUE FOR EXAMPLE AS WAS CLAIMED IN THE PARTY HISTORY BOOKS THAT THE
PARTY HAD INVENTED AEROPLANES HE REMEMBERED AEROPLANES SINCE HIS EARLIEST
CHILDHOOD BUT YOU COULD PROVE NOTHING THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE JUST
ONCE IN HIS WHOLE LIFE HE HAD HELD IN HIS HANDS UNMISTAKABLE DOCUMENTARY
PROOF OF THE FALSIFICATION OF AN HISTORICAL FACT AND ON THAT OCCASION

SMITH SCREAMED THE SHREWISH VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN 6079 SMITH W
YES YOU BEND LOWER PLEASE YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT YOURE NOT
TRYING LOWER PLEASE THATS BETTER COMRADE NOW STAND AT EASE THE
WHOLE SQUAD AND WATCH ME

A SUDDEN HOT SWEAT HAD BROKEN OUT ALL OVER WINSTONS BODY HIS FACE
REMAINED COMPLETELY INSCRUTABLE NEVER SHOW DISMAY NEVER SHOW RESENTMENT
A SINGLE FLICKER OF THE EYES COULD GIVE YOU AWAY HE STOOD WATCHING WHILE
THE INSTRUCTRESS RAISED HER ARMS ABOVE HER HEAD ANDONE COULD NOT SAY
GRACEFULLY BUT WITH REMARKABLE NEATNESS AND EFFICIENCYBENT OVER AND
TUCKED THE FIRST JOINT OF HER FINGERS UNDER HER TOES

THERE COMRADES THATS HOW I WANT TO SEE YOU DOING IT WATCH ME AGAIN
IM THIRTYNINE AND IVE HAD FOUR CHILDREN NOW LOOK SHE BENT OVER AGAIN
YOU SEE MY KNEES ARENT BENT YOU CAN ALL DO IT IF YOU WANT TO SHE ADDED
AS SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP ANYONE UNDER FORTYFIVE IS PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF TOUCHING HIS TOES WE DONT ALL HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF FIGHTING
IN THE FRONT LINE BUT AT LEAST WE CAN ALL KEEP FIT REMEMBER OUR BOYS ON
THE MALABAR FRONT AND THE SAILORS IN THE FLOATING FORTRESSES JUST THINK
WHAT THEY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH NOW TRY AGAIN THATS BETTER COMRADE
THATS MUCH BETTER SHE ADDED ENCOURAGINGLY AS WINSTON WITH A VIOLENT
LUNGE SUCCEEDED IN TOUCHING HIS TOES WITH KNEES UNBENT FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN SEVERAL YEARS




CHAPTER 4



WITH THE DEEP UNCONSCIOUS SIGH WHICH NOT EVEN THE NEARNESS OF THE
TELESCREEN COULD PREVENT HIM FROM UTTERING WHEN HIS DAYS WORK STARTED
WINSTON PULLED THE SPEAKWRITE TOWARDS HIM BLEW THE DUST FROM ITS
MOUTHPIECE AND PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES THEN HE UNROLLED AND CLIPPED
TOGETHER FOUR SMALL CYLINDERS OF PAPER WHICH HAD ALREADY FLOPPED OUT OF
THE PNEUMATIC TUBE ON THE RIGHTHAND SIDE OF HIS DESK

IN THE WALLS OF THE CUBICLE THERE WERE THREE ORIFICES TO THE RIGHT OF THE
SPEAKWRITE A SMALL PNEUMATIC TUBE FOR WRITTEN MESSAGES TO THE LEFT A
LARGER ONE FOR NEWSPAPERS AND IN THE SIDE WALL WITHIN EASY REACH OF
WINSTONS ARM A LARGE OBLONG SLIT PROTECTED BY A WIRE GRATING THIS LAST
WAS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE PAPER SIMILAR SLITS EXISTED IN THOUSANDS OR
TENS OF THOUSANDS THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING NOT ONLY IN EVERY ROOM BUT AT
SHORT INTERVALS IN EVERY CORRIDOR FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE NICKNAMED
MEMORY HOLES WHEN ONE KNEW THAT ANY DOCUMENT WAS DUE FOR DESTRUCTION OR
EVEN WHEN ONE SAW A SCRAP OF WASTE PAPER LYING ABOUT IT WAS AN AUTOMATIC
ACTION TO LIFT THE FLAP OF THE NEAREST MEMORY HOLE AND DROP IT IN
WHEREUPON IT WOULD BE WHIRLED AWAY ON A CURRENT OF WARM AIR TO THE ENORMOUS
FURNACES WHICH WERE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THE RECESSES OF THE BUILDING

WINSTON EXAMINED THE FOUR SLIPS OF PAPER WHICH HE HAD UNROLLED EACH
CONTAINED A MESSAGE OF ONLY ONE OR TWO LINES IN THE ABBREVIATED
JARGONNOT ACTUALLY NEWSPEAK BUT CONSISTING
LARGELY OF NEWSPEAK WORDSWHICH WAS USED IN THE MINISTRY FOR INTERNAL
PURPOSES THEY RAN


TIMES 17384 BB SPEECH MALREPORTED AFRICA RECTIFY

TIMES 14284 MINIPLENTY MALQUOTED CHOCOLATE RECTIFY

TIMES 31283 REPORTING BB DAYORDER DOUBLEPLUSUNGOOD REFS UNPERSONS REWRITE
FULLWISE UPSUB ANTEFILING


WITH A FAINT FEELING OF SATISFACTION WINSTON LAID THE FOURTH MESSAGE ASIDE
IT WAS AN INTRICATE AND RESPONSIBLE JOB AND HAD BETTER BE DEALT WITH LAST
THE OTHER THREE WERE ROUTINE MATTERS THOUGH THE SECOND ONE WOULD PROBABLY
MEAN SOME TEDIOUS WADING THROUGH LISTS OF FIGURES

WINSTON DIALLED BACK NUMBERS ON THE TELESCREEN AND CALLED FOR THE
APPROPRIATE ISSUES OF THE TIMES WHICH SLID OUT OF THE PNEUMATIC TUBE
AFTER ONLY A FEW MINUTES DELAY THE MESSAGES HE HAD RECEIVED REFERRED TO
ARTICLES OR NEWS ITEMS WHICH FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER IT WAS THOUGHT
NECESSARY TO ALTER OR AS THE OFFICIAL PHRASE HAD IT TO RECTIFY FOR
EXAMPLE IT APPEARED FROM THE TIMES OF THE SEVENTEENTH OF MARCH THAT BIG
BROTHER IN HIS SPEECH OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HAD PREDICTED THAT THE SOUTH
INDIAN FRONT WOULD REMAIN QUIET BUT THAT A EURASIAN OFFENSIVE WOULD SHORTLY
BE LAUNCHED IN NORTH AFRICA AS IT HAPPENED THE EURASIAN HIGHER COMMAND
HAD LAUNCHED ITS OFFENSIVE IN SOUTH INDIA AND LEFT NORTH AFRICA ALONE IT
WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO REWRITE A PARAGRAPH OF BIG BROTHERS SPEECH IN
SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE HIM PREDICT THE THING THAT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED OR
AGAIN THE TIMES OF THE NINETEENTH OF DECEMBER HAD PUBLISHED THE OFFICIAL
FORECASTS OF THE OUTPUT OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF CONSUMPTION GOODS IN THE
FOURTH QUARTER OF 1983 WHICH WAS ALSO THE SIXTH QUARTER OF THE NINTH
THREEYEAR PLAN TODAYS ISSUE CONTAINED A STATEMENT OF THE ACTUAL OUTPUT
FROM WHICH IT APPEARED THAT THE FORECASTS WERE IN EVERY INSTANCE GROSSLY
WRONG WINSTONS JOB WAS TO RECTIFY THE ORIGINAL FIGURES BY MAKING THEM
AGREE WITH THE LATER ONES AS FOR THE THIRD MESSAGE IT REFERRED TO A VERY
SIMPLE ERROR WHICH COULD BE SET RIGHT IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES AS SHORT
A TIME AGO AS FEBRUARY THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY HAD ISSUED A PROMISE
A CATEGORICAL PLEDGE WERE THE OFFICIAL WORDS THAT THERE WOULD BE
NO REDUCTION OF THE CHOCOLATE RATION DURING 1984 ACTUALLY AS WINSTON
WAS AWARE THE CHOCOLATE RATION WAS TO BE REDUCED FROM THIRTY GRAMMES
TO TWENTY AT THE END OF THE PRESENT WEEK ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS TO
SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ORIGINAL PROMISE A WARNING THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE RATION AT SOME TIME IN APRIL

AS SOON AS WINSTON HAD DEALT WITH EACH OF THE MESSAGES HE CLIPPED HIS
SPEAKWRITTEN CORRECTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE COPY OF THE TIMES AND PUSHED
THEM INTO THE PNEUMATIC TUBE THEN WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS AS NEARLY AS
POSSIBLE UNCONSCIOUS HE CRUMPLED UP THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE AND ANY NOTES
THAT HE HIMSELF HAD MADE AND DROPPED THEM INTO THE MEMORY HOLE TO BE
DEVOURED BY THE FLAMES

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE UNSEEN LABYRINTH TO WHICH THE PNEUMATIC TUBES LED HE
DID NOT KNOW IN DETAIL BUT HE DID KNOW IN GENERAL TERMS AS SOON AS ALL
THE CORRECTIONS WHICH HAPPENED TO BE NECESSARY IN ANY PARTICULAR NUMBER
OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED AND COLLATED THAT NUMBER WOULD BE
REPRINTED THE ORIGINAL COPY DESTROYED AND THE CORRECTED COPY PLACED ON
THE FILES IN ITS STEAD THIS PROCESS OF CONTINUOUS ALTERATION WAS APPLIED
NOT ONLY TO NEWSPAPERS BUT TO BOOKS PERIODICALS PAMPHLETS POSTERS
LEAFLETS FILMS SOUNDTRACKS CARTOONS PHOTOGRAPHSTO EVERY KIND OF
LITERATURE OR DOCUMENTATION WHICH MIGHT CONCEIVABLY HOLD ANY POLITICAL OR
IDEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE DAY BY DAY AND ALMOST MINUTE BY MINUTE THE PAST
WAS BROUGHT UP TO DATE IN THIS WAY EVERY PREDICTION MADE BY THE PARTY
COULD BE SHOWN BY DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE TO HAVE BEEN CORRECT NOR WAS ANY
ITEM OF NEWS OR ANY EXPRESSION OF OPINION WHICH CONFLICTED WITH THE
NEEDS OF THE MOMENT EVER ALLOWED TO REMAIN ON RECORD ALL HISTORY WAS
A PALIMPSEST SCRAPED CLEAN AND REINSCRIBED EXACTLY AS OFTEN AS WAS
NECESSARY IN NO CASE WOULD IT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE ONCE THE DEED WAS DONE
TO PROVE THAT ANY FALSIFICATION HAD TAKEN PLACE THE LARGEST SECTION OF
THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT FAR LARGER THAN THE ONE ON WHICH WINSTON WORKED
CONSISTED SIMPLY OF PERSONS WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO TRACK DOWN AND COLLECT ALL
COPIES OF BOOKS NEWSPAPERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN SUPERSEDED
AND WERE DUE FOR DESTRUCTION A NUMBER OF THE TIMES WHICH MIGHT BECAUSE
OF CHANGES IN POLITICAL ALIGNMENT OR MISTAKEN PROPHECIES UTTERED BY BIG
BROTHER HAVE BEEN REWRITTEN A DOZEN TIMES STILL STOOD ON THE FILES BEARING
ITS ORIGINAL DATE AND NO OTHER COPY EXISTED TO CONTRADICT IT BOOKS ALSO
WERE RECALLED AND REWRITTEN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WERE INVARIABLY REISSUED
WITHOUT ANY ADMISSION THAT ANY ALTERATION HAD BEEN MADE EVEN THE WRITTEN
INSTRUCTIONS WHICH WINSTON RECEIVED AND WHICH HE INVARIABLY GOT RID OF
AS SOON AS HE HAD DEALT WITH THEM NEVER STATED OR IMPLIED THAT AN ACT OF
FORGERY WAS TO BE COMMITTED ALWAYS THE REFERENCE WAS TO SLIPS ERRORS
MISPRINTS OR MISQUOTATIONS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO PUT RIGHT IN THE
INTERESTS OF ACCURACY

BUT ACTUALLY HE THOUGHT AS HE READJUSTED THE MINISTRY OF PLENTYS
FIGURES IT WAS NOT EVEN FORGERY IT WAS MERELY THE SUBSTITUTION OF ONE
PIECE OF NONSENSE FOR ANOTHER MOST OF THE MATERIAL THAT YOU WERE DEALING
WITH HAD NO CONNEXION WITH ANYTHING IN THE REAL WORLD NOT EVEN THE KIND OF
CONNEXION THAT IS CONTAINED IN A DIRECT LIE STATISTICS WERE JUST AS MUCH
A FANTASY IN THEIR ORIGINAL VERSION AS IN THEIR RECTIFIED VERSION A GREAT
DEAL OF THE TIME YOU WERE EXPECTED TO MAKE THEM UP OUT OF YOUR HEAD FOR
EXAMPLE THE MINISTRY OF PLENTYS FORECAST HAD ESTIMATED THE OUTPUT OF
BOOTS FOR THE QUARTER AT 145 MILLION PAIRS THE ACTUAL OUTPUT WAS GIVEN AS
SIXTYTWO MILLIONS WINSTON HOWEVER IN REWRITING THE FORECAST MARKED
THE FIGURE DOWN TO FIFTYSEVEN MILLIONS SO AS TO ALLOW FOR THE USUAL CLAIM
THAT THE QUOTA HAD BEEN OVERFULFILLED IN ANY CASE SIXTYTWO MILLIONS WAS
NO NEARER THE TRUTH THAN FIFTYSEVEN MILLIONS OR THAN 145 MILLIONS VERY
LIKELY NO BOOTS HAD BEEN PRODUCED AT ALL LIKELIER STILL NOBODY KNEW
HOW MANY HAD BEEN PRODUCED MUCH LESS CARED ALL ONE KNEW WAS THAT EVERY
QUARTER ASTRONOMICAL NUMBERS OF BOOTS WERE PRODUCED ON PAPER WHILE PERHAPS
HALF THE POPULATION OF OCEANIA WENT BAREFOOT AND SO IT WAS WITH EVERY
CLASS OF RECORDED FACT GREAT OR SMALL EVERYTHING FADED AWAY INTO A
SHADOWWORLD IN WHICH FINALLY EVEN THE DATE OF THE YEAR HAD BECOME
UNCERTAIN

WINSTON GLANCED ACROSS THE HALL IN THE CORRESPONDING CUBICLE ON THE OTHER
SIDE A SMALL PRECISELOOKING DARKCHINNED MAN NAMED TILLOTSON WAS WORKING
STEADILY AWAY WITH A FOLDED NEWSPAPER ON HIS KNEE AND HIS MOUTH VERY CLOSE
TO THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE SPEAKWRITE HE HAD THE AIR OF TRYING TO KEEP WHAT
HE WAS SAYING A SECRET BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE TELESCREEN HE LOOKED UP
AND HIS SPECTACLES DARTED A HOSTILE FLASH IN WINSTONS DIRECTION

WINSTON HARDLY KNEW TILLOTSON AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT WORK HE WAS EMPLOYED
ON PEOPLE IN THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT DID NOT READILY TALK ABOUT THEIR JOBS
IN THE LONG WINDOWLESS HALL WITH ITS DOUBLE ROW OF CUBICLES AND ITS
ENDLESS RUSTLE OF PAPERS AND HUM OF VOICES MURMURING INTO SPEAKWRITES
THERE WERE QUITE A DOZEN PEOPLE WHOM WINSTON DID NOT EVEN KNOW BY NAME
THOUGH HE DAILY SAW THEM HURRYING TO AND FRO IN THE CORRIDORS OR
GESTICULATING IN THE TWO MINUTES HATE HE KNEW THAT IN THE CUBICLE NEXT
TO HIM THE LITTLE WOMAN WITH SANDY HAIR TOILED DAY IN DAY OUT SIMPLY AT
TRACKING DOWN AND DELETING FROM THE PRESS THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN
VAPORIZED AND WERE THEREFORE CONSIDERED NEVER TO HAVE EXISTED THERE WAS A
CERTAIN FITNESS IN THIS SINCE HER OWN HUSBAND HAD BEEN VAPORIZED A COUPLE
OF YEARS EARLIER AND A FEW CUBICLES AWAY A MILD INEFFECTUAL DREAMY
CREATURE NAMED AMPLEFORTH WITH VERY HAIRY EARS AND A SURPRISING TALENT
FOR JUGGLING WITH RHYMES AND METRES WAS ENGAGED IN PRODUCING GARBLED
VERSIONSDEFINITIVE TEXTS THEY WERE CALLEDOF POEMS WHICH HAD BECOME
IDEOLOGICALLY OFFENSIVE BUT WHICH FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER WERE TO BE
RETAINED IN THE ANTHOLOGIES AND THIS HALL WITH ITS FIFTY WORKERS OR
THEREABOUTS WAS ONLY ONE SUBSECTION A SINGLE CELL AS IT WERE IN THE
HUGE COMPLEXITY OF THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT BEYOND ABOVE BELOW WERE OTHER
SWARMS OF WORKERS ENGAGED IN AN UNIMAGINABLE MULTITUDE OF JOBS THERE WERE
THE HUGE PRINTINGSHOPS WITH THEIR SUBEDITORS THEIR TYPOGRAPHY EXPERTS
AND THEIR ELABORATELY EQUIPPED STUDIOS FOR THE FAKING OF PHOTOGRAPHS THERE
WAS THE TELEPROGRAMMES SECTION WITH ITS ENGINEERS ITS PRODUCERS AND ITS
TEAMS OF ACTORS SPECIALLY CHOSEN FOR THEIR SKILL IN IMITATING VOICES THERE
WERE THE ARMIES OF REFERENCE CLERKS WHOSE JOB WAS SIMPLY TO DRAW UP LISTS
OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS WHICH WERE DUE FOR RECALL THERE WERE THE VAST
REPOSITORIES WHERE THE CORRECTED DOCUMENTS WERE STORED AND THE HIDDEN
FURNACES WHERE THE ORIGINAL COPIES WERE DESTROYED AND SOMEWHERE OR OTHER
QUITE ANONYMOUS THERE WERE THE DIRECTING BRAINS WHO COORDINATED THE WHOLE
EFFORT AND LAID DOWN THE LINES OF POLICY WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT THIS
FRAGMENT OF THE PAST SHOULD BE PRESERVED THAT ONE FALSIFIED AND THE OTHER
RUBBED OUT OF EXISTENCE

AND THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT AFTER ALL WAS ITSELF ONLY A SINGLE BRANCH OF
THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH WHOSE PRIMARY JOB WAS NOT TO RECONSTRUCT THE PAST
BUT TO SUPPLY THE CITIZENS OF OCEANIA WITH NEWSPAPERS FILMS TEXTBOOKS
TELESCREEN PROGRAMMES PLAYS NOVELSWITH EVERY CONCEIVABLE KIND OF
INFORMATION INSTRUCTION OR ENTERTAINMENT FROM A STATUE TO A SLOGAN
FROM A LYRIC POEM TO A BIOLOGICAL TREATISE AND FROM A CHILDS
SPELLINGBOOK TO A NEWSPEAK DICTIONARY AND THE MINISTRY HAD NOT ONLY TO
SUPPLY THE MULTIFARIOUS NEEDS OF THE PARTY BUT ALSO TO REPEAT THE WHOLE
OPERATION AT A LOWER LEVEL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PROLETARIAT THERE
WAS A WHOLE CHAIN OF SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS DEALING WITH PROLETARIAN
LITERATURE MUSIC DRAMA AND ENTERTAINMENT GENERALLY HERE WERE PRODUCED
RUBBISHY NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING ALMOST NOTHING EXCEPT SPORT CRIME AND
ASTROLOGY SENSATIONAL FIVECENT NOVELETTES FILMS OOZING WITH SEX AND
SENTIMENTAL SONGS WHICH WERE COMPOSED ENTIRELY BY MECHANICAL MEANS ON A
SPECIAL KIND OF KALEIDOSCOPE KNOWN AS A VERSIFICATOR THERE WAS EVEN
A WHOLE SUBSECTIONPORNOSEC IT WAS CALLED IN NEWSPEAKENGAGED IN
PRODUCING THE LOWEST KIND OF PORNOGRAPHY WHICH WAS SENT OUT IN SEALED
PACKETS AND WHICH NO PARTY MEMBER OTHER THAN THOSE WHO WORKED ON IT
WAS PERMITTED TO LOOK AT

THREE MESSAGES HAD SLID OUT OF THE PNEUMATIC TUBE WHILE WINSTON WAS
WORKING BUT THEY WERE SIMPLE MATTERS AND HE HAD DISPOSED OF THEM BEFORE
THE TWO MINUTES HATE INTERRUPTED HIM WHEN THE HATE WAS OVER HE RETURNED
TO HIS CUBICLE TOOK THE NEWSPEAK DICTIONARY FROM THE SHELF PUSHED THE
SPEAKWRITE TO ONE SIDE CLEANED HIS SPECTACLES AND SETTLED DOWN TO HIS
MAIN JOB OF THE MORNING

WINSTONS GREATEST PLEASURE IN LIFE WAS IN HIS WORK MOST OF IT WAS A
TEDIOUS ROUTINE BUT INCLUDED IN IT THERE WERE ALSO JOBS SO DIFFICULT AND
INTRICATE THAT YOU COULD LOSE YOURSELF IN THEM AS IN THE DEPTHS OF A
MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMDELICATE PIECES OF FORGERY IN WHICH YOU HAD NOTHING
TO GUIDE YOU EXCEPT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF INGSOC AND YOUR
ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE PARTY WANTED YOU TO SAY WINSTON WAS GOOD AT THIS KIND
OF THING ON OCCASION HE HAD EVEN BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE RECTIFICATION OF
THE TIMES LEADING ARTICLES WHICH WERE WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN NEWSPEAK
HE UNROLLED THE MESSAGE THAT HE HAD SET ASIDE EARLIER IT RAN

IN OLDSPEAK OR STANDARD ENGLISH THIS MIGHT BE RENDERED


THE REPORTING OF BIG BROTHERS ORDER FOR THE DAY IN THE TIMES OF DECEMBER
3RD 1983 IS EXTREMELY UNSATISFACTORY AND MAKES REFERENCES TO NONEXISTENT
PERSONS REWRITE IT IN FULL AND SUBMIT YOUR DRAFT TO HIGHER AUTHORITY
BEFORE FILING


WINSTON READ THROUGH THE OFFENDING ARTICLE BIG BROTHERS ORDER FOR THE
DAY IT SEEMED HAD BEEN CHIEFLY DEVOTED TO PRAISING THE WORK OF AN
ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS FFCC WHICH SUPPLIED CIGARETTES AND OTHER COMFORTS
TO THE SAILORS IN THE FLOATING FORTRESSES A CERTAIN COMRADE WITHERS A
PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE INNER PARTY HAD BEEN SINGLED OUT FOR SPECIAL
MENTION AND AWARDED A DECORATION THE ORDER OF CONSPICUOUS MERIT SECOND
CLASS

THREE MONTHS LATER FFCC HAD SUDDENLY BEEN DISSOLVED WITH NO REASONS GIVEN
ONE COULD ASSUME THAT WITHERS AND HIS ASSOCIATES WERE NOW IN DISGRACE BUT
THERE HAD BEEN NO REPORT OF THE MATTER IN THE PRESS OR ON THE TELESCREEN
THAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED SINCE IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR POLITICAL OFFENDERS TO
BE PUT ON TRIAL OR EVEN PUBLICLY DENOUNCED THE GREAT PURGES INVOLVING
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH PUBLIC TRIALS OF TRAITORS AND THOUGHTCRIMINALS
WHO MADE ABJECT CONFESSION OF THEIR CRIMES AND WERE AFTERWARDS EXECUTED
WERE SPECIAL SHOWPIECES NOT OCCURRING OFTENER THAN ONCE IN A COUPLE OF
YEARS MORE COMMONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE
PARTY SIMPLY DISAPPEARED AND WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN ONE NEVER HAD THE
SMALLEST CLUE AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM IN SOME CASES THEY MIGHT
NOT EVEN BE DEAD PERHAPS THIRTY PEOPLE PERSONALLY KNOWN TO WINSTON NOT
COUNTING HIS PARENTS HAD DISAPPEARED AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER

WINSTON STROKED HIS NOSE GENTLY WITH A PAPERCLIP IN THE CUBICLE
ACROSS THE WAY COMRADE TILLOTSON WAS STILL CROUCHING SECRETIVELY OVER
HIS SPEAKWRITE HE RAISED HIS HEAD FOR A MOMENT AGAIN THE HOSTILE
SPECTACLEFLASH WINSTON WONDERED WHETHER COMRADE TILLOTSON WAS ENGAGED
ON THE SAME JOB AS HIMSELF IT WAS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE SO TRICKY A PIECE
OF WORK WOULD NEVER BE ENTRUSTED TO A SINGLE PERSON ON THE OTHER HAND
TO TURN IT OVER TO A COMMITTEE WOULD BE TO ADMIT OPENLY THAT AN ACT OF
FABRICATION WAS TAKING PLACE VERY LIKELY AS MANY AS A DOZEN PEOPLE WERE
NOW WORKING AWAY ON RIVAL VERSIONS OF WHAT BIG BROTHER HAD ACTUALLY SAID
AND PRESENTLY SOME MASTER BRAIN IN THE INNER PARTY WOULD SELECT THIS
VERSION OR THAT WOULD REEDIT IT AND SET IN MOTION THE COMPLEX PROCESSES
OF CROSSREFERENCING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED AND THEN THE CHOSEN LIE
WOULD PASS INTO THE PERMANENT RECORDS AND BECOME TRUTH

WINSTON DID NOT KNOW WHY WITHERS HAD BEEN DISGRACED PERHAPS IT WAS FOR
CORRUPTION OR INCOMPETENCE PERHAPS BIG BROTHER WAS MERELY GETTING RID OF
A TOOPOPULAR SUBORDINATE PERHAPS WITHERS OR SOMEONE CLOSE TO HIM HAD
BEEN SUSPECTED OF HERETICAL TENDENCIES OR PERHAPSWHAT WAS LIKELIEST OF
ALLTHE THING HAD SIMPLY HAPPENED BECAUSE PURGES AND VAPORIZATIONS WERE A
NECESSARY PART OF THE MECHANICS OF GOVERNMENT THE ONLY REAL CLUE LAY IN
THE WORDS REFS UNPERSONS WHICH INDICATED THAT WITHERS WAS ALREADY DEAD
YOU COULD NOT INVARIABLY ASSUME THIS TO BE THE CASE WHEN PEOPLE WERE
ARRESTED SOMETIMES THEY WERE RELEASED AND ALLOWED TO REMAIN AT LIBERTY
FOR AS MUCH AS A YEAR OR TWO YEARS BEFORE BEING EXECUTED VERY OCCASIONALLY
SOME PERSON WHOM YOU HAD BELIEVED DEAD LONG SINCE WOULD MAKE A GHOSTLY
REAPPEARANCE AT SOME PUBLIC TRIAL WHERE HE WOULD IMPLICATE HUNDREDS OF
OTHERS BY HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE VANISHING THIS TIME FOR EVER WITHERS
HOWEVER WAS ALREADY AN UNPERSON HE DID NOT EXIST HE HAD NEVER EXISTED
WINSTON DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH SIMPLY TO REVERSE THE TENDENCY
OF BIG BROTHERS SPEECH IT WAS BETTER TO MAKE IT DEAL WITH SOMETHING
TOTALLY UNCONNECTED WITH ITS ORIGINAL SUBJECT

HE MIGHT TURN THE SPEECH INTO THE USUAL DENUNCIATION OF TRAITORS AND
THOUGHTCRIMINALS BUT THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS WHILE TO INVENT A
VICTORY AT THE FRONT OR SOME TRIUMPH OF OVERPRODUCTION IN THE NINTH
THREEYEAR PLAN MIGHT COMPLICATE THE RECORDS TOO MUCH WHAT WAS NEEDED
WAS A PIECE OF PURE FANTASY SUDDENLY THERE SPRANG INTO HIS MIND READY
MADE AS IT WERE THE IMAGE OF A CERTAIN COMRADE OGILVY WHO HAD RECENTLY
DIED IN BATTLE IN HEROIC CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WERE OCCASIONS WHEN BIG
BROTHER DEVOTED HIS ORDER FOR THE DAY TO COMMEMORATING SOME HUMBLE
RANKANDFILE PARTY MEMBER WHOSE LIFE AND DEATH HE HELD UP AS AN EXAMPLE
WORTHY TO BE FOLLOWED TODAY HE SHOULD COMMEMORATE COMRADE OGILVY IT WAS
TRUE THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON AS COMRADE OGILVY BUT A FEW LINES OF
PRINT AND A COUPLE OF FAKED PHOTOGRAPHS WOULD SOON BRING HIM INTO
EXISTENCE

WINSTON THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THEN PULLED THE SPEAKWRITE TOWARDS HIM AND
BEGAN DICTATING IN BIG BROTHERS FAMILIAR STYLE A STYLE AT ONCE MILITARY
AND PEDANTIC AND BECAUSE OF A TRICK OF ASKING QUESTIONS AND THEN
PROMPTLY ANSWERING THEM WHAT LESSONS DO WE LEARN FROM THIS FACT
COMRADES THE LESSONWHICH IS ALSO ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
OF INGSOCTHAT ETC ETC EASY TO IMITATE

AT THE AGE OF THREE COMRADE OGILVY HAD REFUSED ALL TOYS EXCEPT A DRUM A
SUBMACHINE GUN AND A MODEL HELICOPTER AT SIXA YEAR EARLY BY A SPECIAL
RELAXATION OF THE RULESHE HAD JOINED THE SPIES AT NINE HE HAD BEEN A
TROOP LEADER AT ELEVEN HE HAD DENOUNCED HIS UNCLE TO THE THOUGHT POLICE
AFTER OVERHEARING A CONVERSATION WHICH APPEARED TO HIM TO HAVE CRIMINAL
TENDENCIES AT SEVENTEEN HE HAD BEEN A DISTRICT ORGANIZER OF THE JUNIOR
ANTISEX LEAGUE AT NINETEEN HE HAD DESIGNED A HANDGRENADE WHICH HAD
BEEN ADOPTED BY THE MINISTRY OF PEACE AND WHICH AT ITS FIRST TRIAL HAD
KILLED THIRTYONE EURASIAN PRISONERS IN ONE BURST AT TWENTYTHREE HE HAD
PERISHED IN ACTION PURSUED BY ENEMY JET PLANES WHILE FLYING OVER THE
INDIAN OCEAN WITH IMPORTANT DESPATCHES HE HAD WEIGHTED HIS BODY WITH HIS
MACHINE GUN AND LEAPT OUT OF THE HELICOPTER INTO DEEP WATER DESPATCHES
AND ALLAN END SAID BIG BROTHER WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE
WITHOUT FEELINGS OF ENVY BIG BROTHER ADDED A FEW REMARKS ON THE PURITY
AND SINGLEMINDEDNESS OF COMRADE OGILVYS LIFE HE WAS A TOTAL ABSTAINER
AND A NONSMOKER HAD NO RECREATIONS EXCEPT A DAILY HOUR IN THE GYMNASIUM
AND HAD TAKEN A VOW OF CELIBACY BELIEVING MARRIAGE AND THE CARE OF A
FAMILY TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A TWENTYFOURHOURADAY DEVOTION TO DUTY
HE HAD NO SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION EXCEPT THE PRINCIPLES OF INGSOC AND
NO AIM IN LIFE EXCEPT THE DEFEAT OF THE EURASIAN ENEMY AND THE HUNTINGDOWN
OF SPIES SABOTEURS THOUGHTCRIMINALS AND TRAITORS GENERALLY

WINSTON DEBATED WITH HIMSELF WHETHER TO AWARD COMRADE OGILVY THE ORDER OF
CONSPICUOUS MERIT IN THE END HE DECIDED AGAINST IT BECAUSE OF THE
UNNECESSARY CROSSREFERENCING THAT IT WOULD ENTAIL

ONCE AGAIN HE GLANCED AT HIS RIVAL IN THE OPPOSITE CUBICLE SOMETHING
SEEMED TO TELL HIM WITH CERTAINTY THAT TILLOTSON WAS BUSY ON THE SAME JOB
AS HIMSELF THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHOSE JOB WOULD FINALLY BE ADOPTED
BUT HE FELT A PROFOUND CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD BE HIS OWN COMRADE OGILVY
UNIMAGINED AN HOUR AGO WAS NOW A FACT IT STRUCK HIM AS CURIOUS THAT YOU
COULD CREATE DEAD MEN BUT NOT LIVING ONES COMRADE OGILVY WHO HAD NEVER
EXISTED IN THE PRESENT NOW EXISTED IN THE PAST AND WHEN ONCE THE ACT OF
FORGERY WAS FORGOTTEN HE WOULD EXIST JUST AS AUTHENTICALLY AND UPON THE
SAME EVIDENCE AS CHARLEMAGNE OR JULIUS CAESAR




CHAPTER 5



IN THE LOWCEILINGED CANTEEN DEEP UNDERGROUND THE LUNCH QUEUE JERKED
SLOWLY FORWARD THE ROOM WAS ALREADY VERY FULL AND DEAFENINGLY NOISY FROM
THE GRILLE AT THE COUNTER THE STEAM OF STEW CAME POURING FORTH WITH A SOUR
METALLIC SMELL WHICH DID NOT QUITE OVERCOME THE FUMES OF VICTORY GIN ON
THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A SMALL BAR A MERE HOLE IN THE WALL
WHERE GIN COULD BE BOUGHT AT TEN CENTS THE LARGE NIP

JUST THE MAN I WAS LOOKING FOR SAID A VOICE AT WINSTONS BACK

HE TURNED ROUND IT WAS HIS FRIEND SYME WHO WORKED IN THE RESEARCH
DEPARTMENT PERHAPS FRIEND WAS NOT EXACTLY THE RIGHT WORD YOU DID NOT
HAVE FRIENDS NOWADAYS YOU HAD COMRADES BUT THERE WERE SOME COMRADES WHOSE
SOCIETY WAS PLEASANTER THAN THAT OF OTHERS SYME WAS A PHILOLOGIST A
SPECIALIST IN NEWSPEAK INDEED HE WAS ONE OF THE ENORMOUS TEAM OF EXPERTS
NOW ENGAGED IN COMPILING THE ELEVENTH EDITION OF THE NEWSPEAK DICTIONARY
HE WAS A TINY CREATURE SMALLER THAN WINSTON WITH DARK HAIR AND LARGE
PROTUBERANT EYES AT ONCE MOURNFUL AND DERISIVE WHICH SEEMED TO SEARCH
YOUR FACE CLOSELY WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING TO YOU

I WANTED TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOUD GOT ANY RAZOR BLADES HE SAID

NOT ONE SAID WINSTON WITH A SORT OF GUILTY HASTE IVE TRIED ALL OVER
THE PLACE THEY DONT EXIST ANY LONGER

EVERYONE KEPT ASKING YOU FOR RAZOR BLADES ACTUALLY HE HAD TWO UNUSED ONES
WHICH HE WAS HOARDING UP THERE HAD BEEN A FAMINE OF THEM FOR MONTHS PAST
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT THERE WAS SOME NECESSARY ARTICLE WHICH THE PARTY SHOPS
WERE UNABLE TO SUPPLY SOMETIMES IT WAS BUTTONS SOMETIMES IT WAS DARNING
WOOL SOMETIMES IT WAS SHOELACES AT PRESENT IT WAS RAZOR BLADES YOU COULD
ONLY GET HOLD OF THEM IF AT ALL BY SCROUNGING MORE OR LESS FURTIVELY ON
THE FREE MARKET

IVE BEEN USING THE SAME BLADE FOR SIX WEEKS HE ADDED UNTRUTHFULLY

THE QUEUE GAVE ANOTHER JERK FORWARD AS THEY HALTED HE TURNED AND FACED
SYME AGAIN EACH OF THEM TOOK A GREASY METAL TRAY FROM A PILE AT THE END
OF THE COUNTER

DID YOU GO AND SEE THE PRISONERS HANGED YESTERDAY SAID SYME

I WAS WORKING SAID WINSTON INDIFFERENTLY I SHALL SEE IT ON THE
FLICKS I SUPPOSE

A VERY INADEQUATE SUBSTITUTE SAID SYME

HIS MOCKING EYES ROVED OVER WINSTONS FACE I KNOW YOU THE EYES SEEMED
TO SAY I SEE THROUGH YOU I KNOW VERY WELL WHY YOU DIDNT GO TO SEE
THOSE PRISONERS HANGED IN AN INTELLECTUAL WAY SYME WAS VENOMOUSLY
ORTHODOX HE WOULD TALK WITH A DISAGREEABLE GLOATING SATISFACTION OF
HELICOPTER RAIDS ON ENEMY VILLAGES AND TRIALS AND CONFESSIONS OF
THOUGHTCRIMINALS THE EXECUTIONS IN THE CELLARS OF THE MINISTRY OF LOVE
TALKING TO HIM WAS LARGELY A MATTER OF GETTING HIM AWAY FROM SUCH SUBJECTS
AND ENTANGLING HIM IF POSSIBLE IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF NEWSPEAK ON
WHICH HE WAS AUTHORITATIVE AND INTERESTING WINSTON TURNED HIS HEAD A
LITTLE ASIDE TO AVOID THE SCRUTINY OF THE LARGE DARK EYES

IT WAS A GOOD HANGING SAID SYME REMINISCENTLY I THINK IT SPOILS IT
WHEN THEY TIE THEIR FEET TOGETHER I LIKE TO SEE THEM KICKING AND ABOVE
ALL AT THE END THE TONGUE STICKING RIGHT OUT AND BLUEA QUITE BRIGHT
BLUE THATS THE DETAIL THAT APPEALS TO ME

NEX PLEASE YELLED THE WHITEAPRONED PROLE WITH THE LADLE

WINSTON AND SYME PUSHED THEIR TRAYS BENEATH THE GRILLE ON TO EACH WAS
DUMPED SWIFTLY THE REGULATION LUNCHA METAL PANNIKIN OF PINKISHGREY STEW
A HUNK OF BREAD A CUBE OF CHEESE A MUG OF MILKLESS VICTORY COFFEE AND
ONE SACCHARINE TABLET

THERES A TABLE OVER THERE UNDER THAT TELESCREEN SAID SYME LETS PICK
UP A GIN ON THE WAY

THE GIN WAS SERVED OUT TO THEM IN HANDLELESS CHINA MUGS THEY THREADED
THEIR WAY ACROSS THE CROWDED ROOM AND UNPACKED THEIR TRAYS ON TO THE
METALTOPPED TABLE ON ONE CORNER OF WHICH SOMEONE HAD LEFT A POOL OF STEW
A FILTHY LIQUID MESS THAT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF VOMIT WINSTON TOOK UP HIS
MUG OF GIN PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT TO COLLECT HIS NERVE AND GULPED THE
OILYTASTING STUFF DOWN WHEN HE HAD WINKED THE TEARS OUT OF HIS EYES HE
SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS HUNGRY HE BEGAN SWALLOWING SPOONFULS OF
THE STEW WHICH IN AMONG ITS GENERAL SLOPPINESS HAD CUBES OF SPONGY
PINKISH STUFF WHICH WAS PROBABLY A PREPARATION OF MEAT NEITHER OF THEM
SPOKE AGAIN TILL THEY HAD EMPTIED THEIR PANNIKINS FROM THE TABLE AT
WINSTONS LEFT A LITTLE BEHIND HIS BACK SOMEONE WAS TALKING RAPIDLY AND
CONTINUOUSLY A HARSH GABBLE ALMOST LIKE THE QUACKING OF A DUCK WHICH
PIERCED THE GENERAL UPROAR OF THE ROOM

HOW IS THE DICTIONARY GETTING ON SAID WINSTON RAISING HIS VOICE TO
OVERCOME THE NOISE

SLOWLY SAID SYME IM ON THE ADJECTIVES ITS FASCINATING

HE HAD BRIGHTENED UP IMMEDIATELY AT THE MENTION OF NEWSPEAK HE PUSHED HIS
PANNIKIN ASIDE TOOK UP HIS HUNK OF BREAD IN ONE DELICATE HAND AND HIS
CHEESE IN THE OTHER AND LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK
WITHOUT SHOUTING

THE ELEVENTH EDITION IS THE DEFINITIVE EDITION HE SAID WERE GETTING
THE LANGUAGE INTO ITS FINAL SHAPETHE SHAPE ITS GOING TO HAVE WHEN NOBODY
SPEAKS ANYTHING ELSE WHEN WEVE FINISHED WITH IT PEOPLE LIKE YOU WILL
HAVE TO LEARN IT ALL OVER AGAIN YOU THINK I DARE SAY THAT OUR CHIEF JOB
IS INVENTING NEW WORDS BUT NOT A BIT OF IT WERE DESTROYING WORDSSCORES
OF THEM HUNDREDS OF THEM EVERY DAY WERE CUTTING THE LANGUAGE DOWN TO
THE BONE THE ELEVENTH EDITION WONT CONTAIN A SINGLE WORD THAT WILL BECOME
OBSOLETE BEFORE THE YEAR 2050

HE BIT HUNGRILY INTO HIS BREAD AND SWALLOWED A COUPLE OF MOUTHFULS THEN
CONTINUED SPEAKING WITH A SORT OF PEDANTS PASSION HIS THIN DARK FACE
HAD BECOME ANIMATED HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR MOCKING EXPRESSION AND GROWN
ALMOST DREAMY

ITS A BEAUTIFUL THING THE DESTRUCTION OF WORDS OF COURSE THE GREAT
WASTAGE IS IN THE VERBS AND ADJECTIVES BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF NOUNS
THAT CAN BE GOT RID OF AS WELL IT ISNT ONLY THE SYNONYMS THERE ARE ALSO
THE ANTONYMS AFTER ALL WHAT JUSTIFICATION IS THERE FOR A WORD WHICH IS
SIMPLY THE OPPOSITE OF SOME OTHER WORD A WORD CONTAINS ITS OPPOSITE IN
ITSELF TAKE GOOD FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A WORD LIKE GOOD WHAT
NEED IS THERE FOR A WORD LIKE BAD UNGOOD WILL DO JUST AS WELLBETTER
BECAUSE ITS AN EXACT OPPOSITE WHICH THE OTHER IS NOT OR AGAIN IF YOU
WANT A STRONGER VERSION OF GOOD WHAT SENSE IS THERE IN HAVING A WHOLE
STRING OF VAGUE USELESS WORDS LIKE EXCELLENT AND SPLENDID AND ALL THE
REST OF THEM PLUSGOOD COVERS THE MEANING OR DOUBLEPLUSGOOD IF YOU
WANT SOMETHING STRONGER STILL OF COURSE WE USE THOSE FORMS ALREADY BUT
IN THE FINAL VERSION OF NEWSPEAK THERELL BE NOTHING ELSE IN THE END THE
WHOLE NOTION OF GOODNESS AND BADNESS WILL BE COVERED BY ONLY SIX WORDSIN
REALITY ONLY ONE WORD DONT YOU SEE THE BEAUTY OF THAT WINSTON IT WAS
BBS IDEA ORIGINALLY OF COURSE HE ADDED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT

A SORT OF VAPID EAGERNESS FLITTED ACROSS WINSTONS FACE AT THE MENTION OF
BIG BROTHER NEVERTHELESS SYME IMMEDIATELY DETECTED A CERTAIN LACK OF
ENTHUSIASM

YOU HAVENT A REAL APPRECIATION OF NEWSPEAK WINSTON HE SAID ALMOST
SADLY EVEN WHEN YOU WRITE IT YOURE STILL THINKING IN OLDSPEAK IVE READ
SOME OF THOSE PIECES THAT YOU WRITE IN THE TIMES OCCASIONALLY THEYRE
GOOD ENOUGH BUT THEYRE TRANSLATIONS IN YOUR HEART YOUD PREFER TO STICK
TO OLDSPEAK WITH ALL ITS VAGUENESS AND ITS USELESS SHADES OF MEANING
YOU DONT GRASP THE BEAUTY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WORDS DO YOU KNOW THAT
NEWSPEAK IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD WHOSE VOCABULARY GETS SMALLER
EVERY YEAR

WINSTON DID KNOW THAT OF COURSE HE SMILED SYMPATHETICALLY HE HOPED NOT
TRUSTING HIMSELF TO SPEAK SYME BIT OFF ANOTHER FRAGMENT OF THE
DARKCOLOURED BREAD CHEWED IT BRIEFLY AND WENT ON

DONT YOU SEE THAT THE WHOLE AIM OF NEWSPEAK IS TO NARROW THE RANGE OF
THOUGHT IN THE END WE SHALL MAKE THOUGHTCRIME LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO WORDS IN WHICH TO EXPRESS IT EVERY CONCEPT THAT
CAN EVER BE NEEDED WILL BE EXPRESSED BY EXACTLY ONE WORD WITH ITS MEANING
RIGIDLY DEFINED AND ALL ITS SUBSIDIARY MEANINGS RUBBED OUT AND FORGOTTEN
ALREADY IN THE ELEVENTH EDITION WERE NOT FAR FROM THAT POINT BUT THE
PROCESS WILL STILL BE CONTINUING LONG AFTER YOU AND I ARE DEAD EVERY YEAR
FEWER AND FEWER WORDS AND THE RANGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS ALWAYS A LITTLE
SMALLER EVEN NOW OF COURSE THERES NO REASON OR EXCUSE FOR COMMITTING
THOUGHTCRIME ITS MERELY A QUESTION OF SELFDISCIPLINE REALITYCONTROL
BUT IN THE END THERE WONT BE ANY NEED EVEN FOR THAT THE REVOLUTION WILL
BE COMPLETE WHEN THE LANGUAGE IS PERFECT NEWSPEAK IS INGSOC AND INGSOC
IS NEWSPEAK HE ADDED WITH A SORT OF MYSTICAL SATISFACTION HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU WINSTON THAT BY THE YEAR 2050 AT THE VERY LATEST NOT A
SINGLE HUMAN BEING WILL BE ALIVE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND SUCH A CONVERSATION
AS WE ARE HAVING NOW

EXCEPT BEGAN WINSTON DOUBTFULLY AND HE STOPPED

IT HAD BEEN ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE TO SAY EXCEPT THE PROLES BUT HE
CHECKED HIMSELF NOT FEELING FULLY CERTAIN THAT THIS REMARK WAS NOT IN
SOME WAY UNORTHODOX SYME HOWEVER HAD DIVINED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY

THE PROLES ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS HE SAID CARELESSLY BY 2050EARLIER
PROBABLYALL REAL KNOWLEDGE OF OLDSPEAK WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED THE WHOLE
LITERATURE OF THE PAST WILL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED CHAUCER SHAKESPEARE
MILTON BYRONTHEYLL EXIST ONLY IN NEWSPEAK VERSIONS NOT MERELY CHANGED
INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT ACTUALLY CHANGED INTO SOMETHING CONTRADICTORY
OF WHAT THEY USED TO BE EVEN THE LITERATURE OF THE PARTY WILL CHANGE
EVEN THE SLOGANS WILL CHANGE HOW COULD YOU HAVE A SLOGAN LIKE FREEDOM IS
SLAVERY WHEN THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM HAS BEEN ABOLISHED THE WHOLE CLIMATE
OF THOUGHT WILL BE DIFFERENT IN FACT THERE WILL BE NO THOUGHT AS WE
UNDERSTAND IT NOW ORTHODOXY MEANS NOT THINKINGNOT NEEDING TO THINK
ORTHODOXY IS UNCONSCIOUSNESS

ONE OF THESE DAYS THOUGHT WINSTON WITH SUDDEN DEEP CONVICTION SYME WILL
BE VAPORIZED HE IS TOO INTELLIGENT HE SEES TOO CLEARLY AND SPEAKS TOO
PLAINLY THE PARTY DOES NOT LIKE SUCH PEOPLE ONE DAY HE WILL DISAPPEAR
IT IS WRITTEN IN HIS FACE

WINSTON HAD FINISHED HIS BREAD AND CHEESE HE TURNED A LITTLE SIDEWAYS
IN HIS CHAIR TO DRINK HIS MUG OF COFFEE AT THE TABLE ON HIS LEFT THE MAN
WITH THE STRIDENT VOICE WAS STILL TALKING REMORSELESSLY AWAY A YOUNG
WOMAN WHO WAS PERHAPS HIS SECRETARY AND WHO WAS SITTING WITH HER BACK
TO WINSTON WAS LISTENING TO HIM AND SEEMED TO BE EAGERLY AGREEING WITH
EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID FROM TIME TO TIME WINSTON CAUGHT SOME SUCH REMARK
AS I THINK YOURE SO RIGHT I DO SO AGREE WITH YOU UTTERED IN A YOUTHFUL
AND RATHER SILLY FEMININE VOICE BUT THE OTHER VOICE NEVER STOPPED FOR AN
INSTANT EVEN WHEN THE GIRL WAS SPEAKING WINSTON KNEW THE MAN BY SIGHT
THOUGH HE KNEW NO MORE ABOUT HIM THAN THAT HE HELD SOME IMPORTANT POST
IN THE FICTION DEPARTMENT HE WAS A MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY WITH A MUSCULAR
THROAT AND A LARGE MOBILE MOUTH HIS HEAD WAS THROWN BACK A LITTLE AND
BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE AT WHICH HE WAS SITTING HIS SPECTACLES CAUGHT THE
LIGHT AND PRESENTED TO WINSTON TWO BLANK DISCS INSTEAD OF EYES WHAT WAS
SLIGHTLY HORRIBLE WAS THAT FROM THE STREAM OF SOUND THAT POURED OUT OF
HIS MOUTH IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH A SINGLE WORD JUST
ONCE WINSTON CAUGHT A PHRASECOMPLETE AND FINAL ELIMINATION OF
GOLDSTEINISMJERKED OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND AS IT SEEMED ALL IN ONE PIECE
LIKE A LINE OF TYPE CAST SOLID FOR THE REST IT WAS JUST A NOISE A
QUACKQUACKQUACKING AND YET THOUGH YOU COULD NOT ACTUALLY HEAR WHAT THE
MAN WAS SAYING YOU COULD NOT BE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT ITS GENERAL NATURE
HE MIGHT BE DENOUNCING GOLDSTEIN AND DEMANDING STERNER MEASURES AGAINST
THOUGHTCRIMINALS AND SABOTEURS HE MIGHT BE FULMINATING AGAINST THE
ATROCITIES OF THE EURASIAN ARMY HE MIGHT BE PRAISING BIG BROTHER OR THE
HEROES ON THE MALABAR FRONTIT MADE NO DIFFERENCE WHATEVER IT WAS YOU
COULD BE CERTAIN THAT EVERY WORD OF IT WAS PURE ORTHODOXY PURE INGSOC
AS HE WATCHED THE EYELESS FACE WITH THE JAW MOVING RAPIDLY UP AND DOWN
WINSTON HAD A CURIOUS FEELING THAT THIS WAS NOT A REAL HUMAN BEING BUT
SOME KIND OF DUMMY IT WAS NOT THE MANS BRAIN THAT WAS SPEAKING IT WAS
HIS LARYNX THE STUFF THAT WAS COMING OUT OF HIM CONSISTED OF WORDS BUT
IT WAS NOT SPEECH IN THE TRUE SENSE IT WAS A NOISE UTTERED IN
UNCONSCIOUSNESS LIKE THE QUACKING OF A DUCK

SYME HAD FALLEN SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS SPOON WAS
TRACING PATTERNS IN THE PUDDLE OF STEW THE VOICE FROM THE OTHER TABLE
QUACKED RAPIDLY ON EASILY AUDIBLE IN SPITE OF THE SURROUNDING DIN

THERE IS A WORD IN NEWSPEAK SAID SYME I DONT KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW
IT DUCKSPEAK TO QUACK LIKE A DUCK IT IS ONE OF THOSE INTERESTING WORDS
THAT HAVE TWO CONTRADICTORY MEANINGS APPLIED TO AN OPPONENT IT IS ABUSE
APPLIED TO SOMEONE YOU AGREE WITH IT IS PRAISE

UNQUESTIONABLY SYME WILL BE VAPORIZED WINSTON THOUGHT AGAIN HE THOUGHT
IT WITH A KIND OF SADNESS ALTHOUGH WELL KNOWING THAT SYME DESPISED HIM
AND SLIGHTLY DISLIKED HIM AND WAS FULLY CAPABLE OF DENOUNCING HIM AS A
THOUGHTCRIMINAL IF HE SAW ANY REASON FOR DOING SO THERE WAS SOMETHING
SUBTLY WRONG WITH SYME THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HE LACKED DISCRETION
ALOOFNESS A SORT OF SAVING STUPIDITY YOU COULD NOT SAY THAT HE WAS
UNORTHODOX HE BELIEVED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF INGSOC HE VENERATED BIG
BROTHER HE REJOICED OVER VICTORIES HE HATED HERETICS NOT MERELY WITH
SINCERITY BUT WITH A SORT OF RESTLESS ZEAL AN UPTODATENESS OF
INFORMATION WHICH THE ORDINARY PARTY MEMBER DID NOT APPROACH YET A FAINT
AIR OF DISREPUTABILITY ALWAYS CLUNG TO HIM HE SAID THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN BETTER UNSAID HE HAD READ TOO MANY BOOKS HE FREQUENTED THE CHESTNUT
TREE CAFE HAUNT OF PAINTERS AND MUSICIANS THERE WAS NO LAW NOT EVEN AN
UNWRITTEN LAW AGAINST FREQUENTING THE CHESTNUT TREE CAFE YET THE PLACE
WAS SOMEHOW ILLOMENED THE OLD DISCREDITED LEADERS OF THE PARTY HAD BEEN
USED TO GATHER THERE BEFORE THEY WERE FINALLY PURGED GOLDSTEIN HIMSELF
IT WAS SAID HAD SOMETIMES BEEN SEEN THERE YEARS AND DECADES AGO SYMES
FATE WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO FORESEE AND YET IT WAS A FACT THAT IF SYME
GRASPED EVEN FOR THREE SECONDS THE NATURE OF HIS WINSTONS SECRET
OPINIONS HE WOULD BETRAY HIM INSTANTLY TO THE THOUGHT POLICE SO WOULD
ANYBODY ELSE FOR THAT MATTER BUT SYME MORE THAN MOST ZEAL WAS NOT
ENOUGH ORTHODOXY WAS UNCONSCIOUSNESS

SYME LOOKED UP HERE COMES PARSONS HE SAID

SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF HIS VOICE SEEMED TO ADD THAT BLOODY FOOL
PARSONS WINSTONS FELLOWTENANT AT VICTORY MANSIONS WAS IN FACT THREADING
HIS WAY ACROSS THE ROOMA TUBBY MIDDLESIZED MAN WITH FAIR HAIR AND A
FROGLIKE FACE AT THIRTYFIVE HE WAS ALREADY PUTTING ON ROLLS OF FAT AT
NECK AND WAISTLINE BUT HIS MOVEMENTS WERE BRISK AND BOYISH HIS WHOLE
APPEARANCE WAS THAT OF A LITTLE BOY GROWN LARGE SO MUCH SO THAT ALTHOUGH
HE WAS WEARING THE REGULATION OVERALLS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO
THINK OF HIM AS BEING DRESSED IN THE BLUE SHORTS GREY SHIRT AND RED
NECKERCHIEF OF THE SPIES IN VISUALIZING HIM ONE SAW ALWAYS A PICTURE OF
DIMPLED KNEES AND SLEEVES ROLLED BACK FROM PUDGY FOREARMS PARSONS DID
INDEED INVARIABLY REVERT TO SHORTS WHEN A COMMUNITY HIKE OR ANY OTHER
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE FOR DOING SO HE GREETED THEM BOTH
WITH A CHEERY HULLO HULLO AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE GIVING OFF AN
INTENSE SMELL OF SWEAT BEADS OF MOISTURE STOOD OUT ALL OVER HIS PINK FACE
HIS POWERS OF SWEATING WERE EXTRAORDINARY AT THE COMMUNITY CENTRE YOU
COULD ALWAYS TELL WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLAYING TABLETENNIS BY THE DAMPNESS OF
THE BAT HANDLE SYME HAD PRODUCED A STRIP OF PAPER ON WHICH THERE WAS A
LONG COLUMN OF WORDS AND WAS STUDYING IT WITH AN INKPENCIL BETWEEN HIS
FINGERS

LOOK AT HIM WORKING AWAY IN THE LUNCH HOUR SAID PARSONS NUDGING
WINSTON KEENNESS EH WHATS THAT YOUVE GOT THERE OLD BOY SOMETHING
A BIT TOO BRAINY FOR ME I EXPECT SMITH OLD BOY ILL TELL YOU WHY IM
CHASING YOU ITS THAT SUB YOU FORGOT TO GIVE ME

WHICH SUB IS THAT SAID WINSTON AUTOMATICALLY FEELING FOR MONEY ABOUT
A QUARTER OF ONES SALARY HAD TO BE EARMARKED FOR VOLUNTARY SUBSCRIPTIONS
WHICH WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM

FOR HATE WEEK YOU KNOWTHE HOUSEBYHOUSE FUND IM TREASURER FOR OUR
BLOCK WERE MAKING AN ALLOUT EFFORTGOING TO PUT ON A TREMENDOUS SHOW
I TELL YOU IT WONT BE MY FAULT IF OLD VICTORY MANSIONS DOESNT HAVE THE
BIGGEST OUTFIT OF FLAGS IN THE WHOLE STREET TWO DOLLARS YOU PROMISED ME

WINSTON FOUND AND HANDED OVER TWO CREASED AND FILTHY NOTES WHICH PARSONS
ENTERED IN A SMALL NOTEBOOK IN THE NEAT HANDWRITING OF THE ILLITERATE

BY THE WAY OLD BOY HE SAID I HEAR THAT LITTLE BEGGAR OF MINE LET FLY
AT YOU WITH HIS CATAPULT YESTERDAY I GAVE HIM A GOOD DRESSINGDOWN FOR IT
IN FACT I TOLD HIM ID TAKE THE CATAPULT AWAY IF HE DOES IT AGAIN

I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE UPSET AT NOT GOING TO THE EXECUTION SAID
WINSTON

AH WELLWHAT I MEAN TO SAY SHOWS THE RIGHT SPIRIT DOESNT IT
MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE BEGGARS THEY ARE BOTH OF THEM BUT TALK ABOUT KEENNESS
ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS THE SPIES AND THE WAR OF COURSE DYOU KNOW WHAT
THAT LITTLE GIRL OF MINE DID LAST SATURDAY WHEN HER TROOP WAS ON A HIKE
OUT BERKHAMSTED WAY SHE GOT TWO OTHER GIRLS TO GO WITH HER SLIPPED OFF
FROM THE HIKE AND SPENT THE WHOLE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING A STRANGE MAN THEY
KEPT ON HIS TAIL FOR TWO HOURS RIGHT THROUGH THE WOODS AND THEN WHEN
THEY GOT INTO AMERSHAM HANDED HIM OVER TO THE PATROLS

WHAT DID THEY DO THAT FOR SAID WINSTON SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK PARSONS
WENT ON TRIUMPHANTLY

MY KID MADE SURE HE WAS SOME KIND OF ENEMY AGENTMIGHT HAVE BEEN DROPPED
BY PARACHUTE FOR INSTANCE BUT HERES THE POINT OLD BOY WHAT DO YOU
THINK PUT HER ON TO HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE SPOTTED HE WAS WEARING A
FUNNY KIND OF SHOESSAID SHED NEVER SEEN ANYONE WEARING SHOES LIKE THAT
BEFORE SO THE CHANCES WERE HE WAS A FOREIGNER PRETTY SMART FOR A NIPPER
OF SEVEN EH

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN SAID WINSTON

AH THAT I COULDNT SAY OF COURSE BUT I WOULDNT BE ALTOGETHER SURPRISED
IF PARSONS MADE THE MOTION OF AIMING A RIFLE AND CLICKED HIS TONGUE
FOR THE EXPLOSION

GOOD SAID SYME ABSTRACTEDLY WITHOUT LOOKING UP FROM HIS STRIP OF PAPER

OF COURSE WE CANT AFFORD TO TAKE CHANCES AGREED WINSTON DUTIFULLY

WHAT I MEAN TO SAY THERE IS A WAR ON SAID PARSONS

AS THOUGH IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS A TRUMPET CALL FLOATED FROM THE
TELESCREEN JUST ABOVE THEIR HEADS HOWEVER IT WAS NOT THE PROCLAMATION OF
A MILITARY VICTORY THIS TIME BUT MERELY AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE MINISTRY
OF PLENTY

COMRADES CRIED AN EAGER YOUTHFUL VOICE ATTENTION COMRADES WE HAVE
GLORIOUS NEWS FOR YOU WE HAVE WON THE BATTLE FOR PRODUCTION RETURNS NOW
COMPLETED OF THE OUTPUT OF ALL CLASSES OF CONSUMPTION GOODS SHOW THAT THE
STANDARD OF LIVING HAS RISEN BY NO LESS THAN 20 PER CENT OVER THE PAST
YEAR ALL OVER OCEANIA THIS MORNING THERE WERE IRREPRESSIBLE SPONTANEOUS
DEMONSTRATIONS WHEN WORKERS MARCHED OUT OF FACTORIES AND OFFICES AND
PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS WITH BANNERS VOICING THEIR GRATITUDE TO BIG
BROTHER FOR THE NEW HAPPY LIFE WHICH HIS WISE LEADERSHIP HAS BESTOWED
UPON US HERE ARE SOME OF THE COMPLETED FIGURES FOODSTUFFS

THE PHRASE OUR NEW HAPPY LIFE RECURRED SEVERAL TIMES IT HAD BEEN A
FAVOURITE OF LATE WITH THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY PARSONS HIS ATTENTION
CAUGHT BY THE TRUMPET CALL SAT LISTENING WITH A SORT OF GAPING SOLEMNITY
A SORT OF EDIFIED BOREDOM HE COULD NOT FOLLOW THE FIGURES BUT HE WAS
AWARE THAT THEY WERE IN SOME WAY A CAUSE FOR SATISFACTION HE HAD LUGGED
OUT A HUGE AND FILTHY PIPE WHICH WAS ALREADY HALF FULL OF CHARRED TOBACCO
WITH THE TOBACCO RATION AT 100 GRAMMES A WEEK IT WAS SELDOM POSSIBLE TO
FILL A PIPE TO THE TOP WINSTON WAS SMOKING A VICTORY CIGARETTE WHICH HE
HELD CAREFULLY HORIZONTAL THE NEW RATION DID NOT START TILL TOMORROW AND
HE HAD ONLY FOUR CIGARETTES LEFT FOR THE MOMENT HE HAD SHUT HIS EARS TO
THE REMOTER NOISES AND WAS LISTENING TO THE STUFF THAT STREAMED OUT OF THE
TELESCREEN IT APPEARED THAT THERE HAD EVEN BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS TO THANK
BIG BROTHER FOR RAISING THE CHOCOLATE RATION TO TWENTY GRAMMES A WEEK AND
ONLY YESTERDAY HE REFLECTED IT HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT THE RATION WAS
TO BE REDUCED TO TWENTY GRAMMES A WEEK WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD
SWALLOW THAT AFTER ONLY TWENTYFOUR HOURS YES THEY SWALLOWED IT PARSONS
SWALLOWED IT EASILY WITH THE STUPIDITY OF AN ANIMAL THE EYELESS CREATURE
AT THE OTHER TABLE SWALLOWED IT FANATICALLY PASSIONATELY WITH A FURIOUS
DESIRE TO TRACK DOWN DENOUNCE AND VAPORIZE ANYONE WHO SHOULD SUGGEST THAT
LAST WEEK THE RATION HAD BEEN THIRTY GRAMMES SYME TOOIN SOME MORE
COMPLEX WAY INVOLVING DOUBLETHINK SYME SWALLOWED IT WAS HE THEN ALONE
IN THE POSSESSION OF A MEMORY

THE FABULOUS STATISTICS CONTINUED TO POUR OUT OF THE TELESCREEN AS
COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR THERE WAS MORE FOOD MORE CLOTHES MORE HOUSES
MORE FURNITURE MORE COOKINGPOTS MORE FUEL MORE SHIPS MORE HELICOPTERS
MORE BOOKS MORE BABIESMORE OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT DISEASE CRIME AND
INSANITY YEAR BY YEAR AND MINUTE BY MINUTE EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING WAS
WHIZZING RAPIDLY UPWARDS AS SYME HAD DONE EARLIER WINSTON HAD TAKEN UP
HIS SPOON AND WAS DABBLING IN THE PALECOLOURED GRAVY THAT DRIBBLED ACROSS
THE TABLE DRAWING A LONG STREAK OF IT OUT INTO A PATTERN HE MEDITATED
RESENTFULLY ON THE PHYSICAL TEXTURE OF LIFE HAD IT ALWAYS BEEN LIKE
THIS HAD FOOD ALWAYS TASTED LIKE THIS HE LOOKED ROUND THE CANTEEN
A LOWCEILINGED CROWDED ROOM ITS WALLS GRIMY FROM THE CONTACT OF
INNUMERABLE BODIES BATTERED METAL TABLES AND CHAIRS PLACED SO CLOSE
TOGETHER THAT YOU SAT WITH ELBOWS TOUCHING BENT SPOONS DENTED TRAYS
COARSE WHITE MUGS ALL SURFACES GREASY GRIME IN EVERY CRACK AND A
SOURISH COMPOSITE SMELL OF BAD GIN AND BAD COFFEE AND METALLIC STEW AND
DIRTY CLOTHES ALWAYS IN YOUR STOMACH AND IN YOUR SKIN THERE WAS A SORT
OF PROTEST A FEELING THAT YOU HAD BEEN CHEATED OF SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD
A RIGHT TO IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD NO MEMORIES OF ANYTHING GREATLY
DIFFERENT IN ANY TIME THAT HE COULD ACCURATELY REMEMBER THERE HAD NEVER
BEEN QUITE ENOUGH TO EAT ONE HAD NEVER HAD SOCKS OR UNDERCLOTHES THAT
WERE NOT FULL OF HOLES FURNITURE HAD ALWAYS BEEN BATTERED AND RICKETY
ROOMS UNDERHEATED TUBE TRAINS CROWDED HOUSES FALLING TO PIECES
BREAD DARKCOLOURED TEA A RARITY COFFEE FILTHYTASTING CIGARETTES
INSUFFICIENTNOTHING CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL EXCEPT SYNTHETIC GIN AND THOUGH
OF COURSE IT GREW WORSE AS ONES BODY AGED WAS IT NOT A SIGN THAT THIS
WAS NOT THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS IF ONES HEART SICKENED AT THE
DISCOMFORT AND DIRT AND SCARCITY THE INTERMINABLE WINTERS THE STICKINESS
OF ONES SOCKS THE LIFTS THAT NEVER WORKED THE COLD WATER THE GRITTY
SOAP THE CIGARETTES THAT CAME TO PIECES THE FOOD WITH ITS STRANGE EVIL
TASTES WHY SHOULD ONE FEEL IT TO BE INTOLERABLE UNLESS ONE HAD SOME KIND
OF ANCESTRAL MEMORY THAT THINGS HAD ONCE BEEN DIFFERENT

HE LOOKED ROUND THE CANTEEN AGAIN NEARLY EVERYONE WAS UGLY AND WOULD
STILL HAVE BEEN UGLY EVEN IF DRESSED OTHERWISE THAN IN THE UNIFORM BLUE
OVERALLS ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM SITTING AT A TABLE ALONE A SMALL
CURIOUSLY BEETLELIKE MAN WAS DRINKING A CUP OF COFFEE HIS LITTLE EYES
DARTING SUSPICIOUS GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE HOW EASY IT WAS THOUGHT
WINSTON IF YOU DID NOT LOOK ABOUT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THE PHYSICAL TYPE
SET UP BY THE PARTY AS AN IDEALTALL MUSCULAR YOUTHS AND DEEPBOSOMED
MAIDENS BLONDHAIRED VITAL SUNBURNT CAREFREEEXISTED AND EVEN
PREDOMINATED ACTUALLY SO FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
IN AIRSTRIP ONE WERE SMALL DARK AND ILLFAVOURED IT WAS CURIOUS HOW THAT
BEETLELIKE TYPE PROLIFERATED IN THE MINISTRIES LITTLE DUMPY MEN GROWING
STOUT VERY EARLY IN LIFE WITH SHORT LEGS SWIFT SCUTTLING MOVEMENTS AND
FAT INSCRUTABLE FACES WITH VERY SMALL EYES IT WAS THE TYPE THAT SEEMED TO
FLOURISH BEST UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE PARTY

THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY ENDED ON ANOTHER TRUMPET CALL
AND GAVE WAY TO TINNY MUSIC PARSONS STIRRED TO VAGUE ENTHUSIASM BY THE
BOMBARDMENT OF FIGURES TOOK HIS PIPE OUT OF HIS MOUTH

THE MINISTRY OF PLENTYS CERTAINLY DONE A GOOD JOB THIS YEAR HE SAID
WITH A KNOWING SHAKE OF HIS HEAD BY THE WAY SMITH OLD BOY I SUPPOSE
YOU HAVENT GOT ANY RAZOR BLADES YOU CAN LET ME HAVE

NOT ONE SAID WINSTON IVE BEEN USING THE SAME BLADE FOR SIX WEEKS
MYSELF

AH WELLJUST THOUGHT ID ASK YOU OLD BOY

SORRY SAID WINSTON

THE QUACKING VOICE FROM THE NEXT TABLE TEMPORARILY SILENCED DURING THE
MINISTRYS ANNOUNCEMENT HAD STARTED UP AGAIN AS LOUD AS EVER FOR SOME
REASON WINSTON SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF THINKING OF MRS PARSONS WITH HER
WISPY HAIR AND THE DUST IN THE CREASES OF HER FACE WITHIN TWO YEARS THOSE
CHILDREN WOULD BE DENOUNCING HER TO THE THOUGHT POLICE MRS PARSONS WOULD
BE VAPORIZED SYME WOULD BE VAPORIZED WINSTON WOULD BE VAPORIZED OBRIEN
WOULD BE VAPORIZED PARSONS ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD NEVER BE VAPORIZED
THE EYELESS CREATURE WITH THE QUACKING VOICE WOULD NEVER BE VAPORIZED
THE LITTLE BEETLELIKE MEN WHO SCUTTLE SO NIMBLY THROUGH THE LABYRINTHINE
CORRIDORS OF MINISTRIES THEY TOO WOULD NEVER BE VAPORIZED AND THE GIRL
WITH DARK HAIR THE GIRL FROM THE FICTION DEPARTMENTSHE WOULD NEVER BE
VAPORIZED EITHER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE KNEW INSTINCTIVELY WHO WOULD
SURVIVE AND WHO WOULD PERISH THOUGH JUST WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE FOR
SURVIVAL IT WAS NOT EASY TO SAY

AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS DRAGGED OUT OF HIS REVERIE WITH A VIOLENT JERK THE
GIRL AT THE NEXT TABLE HAD TURNED PARTLY ROUND AND WAS LOOKING AT HIM IT
WAS THE GIRL WITH DARK HAIR SHE WAS LOOKING AT HIM IN A SIDELONG WAY BUT
WITH CURIOUS INTENSITY THE INSTANT SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE SHE LOOKED AWAY
AGAIN

THE SWEAT STARTED OUT ON WINSTONS BACKBONE A HORRIBLE PANG OF TERROR
WENT THROUGH HIM IT WAS GONE ALMOST AT ONCE BUT IT LEFT A SORT OF NAGGING
UNEASINESS BEHIND WHY WAS SHE WATCHING HIM WHY DID SHE KEEP FOLLOWING HIM
ABOUT UNFORTUNATELY HE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHETHER SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN AT
THE TABLE WHEN HE ARRIVED OR HAD COME THERE AFTERWARDS BUT YESTERDAY AT
ANY RATE DURING THE TWO MINUTES HATE SHE HAD SAT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM
WHEN THERE WAS NO APPARENT NEED TO DO SO QUITE LIKELY HER REAL OBJECT HAD
BEEN TO LISTEN TO HIM AND MAKE SURE WHETHER HE WAS SHOUTING LOUDLY ENOUGH

HIS EARLIER THOUGHT RETURNED TO HIM PROBABLY SHE WAS NOT ACTUALLY A MEMBER
OF THE THOUGHT POLICE BUT THEN IT WAS PRECISELY THE AMATEUR SPY WHO WAS
THE GREATEST DANGER OF ALL HE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING
AT HIM BUT PERHAPS FOR AS MUCH AS FIVE MINUTES AND IT WAS POSSIBLE
THAT HIS FEATURES HAD NOT BEEN PERFECTLY UNDER CONTROL IT WAS TERRIBLY
DANGEROUS TO LET YOUR THOUGHTS WANDER WHEN YOU WERE IN ANY PUBLIC PLACE
OR WITHIN RANGE OF A TELESCREEN THE SMALLEST THING COULD GIVE YOU AWAY
A NERVOUS TIC AN UNCONSCIOUS LOOK OF ANXIETY A HABIT OF MUTTERING TO
YOURSELFANYTHING THAT CARRIED WITH IT THE SUGGESTION OF ABNORMALITY OF
HAVING SOMETHING TO HIDE IN ANY CASE TO WEAR AN IMPROPER EXPRESSION ON
YOUR FACE TO LOOK INCREDULOUS WHEN A VICTORY WAS ANNOUNCED FOR EXAMPLE
WAS ITSELF A PUNISHABLE OFFENCE THERE WAS EVEN A WORD FOR IT IN NEWSPEAK
FACECRIME IT WAS CALLED

THE GIRL HAD TURNED HER BACK ON HIM AGAIN PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE WAS NOT
REALLY FOLLOWING HIM ABOUT PERHAPS IT WAS COINCIDENCE THAT SHE HAD SAT SO
CLOSE TO HIM TWO DAYS RUNNING HIS CIGARETTE HAD GONE OUT AND HE LAID IT
CAREFULLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE HE WOULD FINISH SMOKING IT AFTER WORK
IF HE COULD KEEP THE TOBACCO IN IT QUITE LIKELY THE PERSON AT THE NEXT
TABLE WAS A SPY OF THE THOUGHT POLICE AND QUITE LIKELY HE WOULD BE IN THE
CELLARS OF THE MINISTRY OF LOVE WITHIN THREE DAYS BUT A CIGARETTE END
MUST NOT BE WASTED SYME HAD FOLDED UP HIS STRIP OF PAPER AND STOWED IT
AWAY IN HIS POCKET PARSONS HAD BEGUN TALKING AGAIN

DID I EVER TELL YOU OLD BOY HE SAID CHUCKLING ROUND THE STEM OF HIS
PIPE ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THOSE TWO NIPPERS OF MINE SET FIRE TO THE OLD
MARKETWOMANS SKIRT BECAUSE THEY SAW HER WRAPPING UP SAUSAGES IN A POSTER
OF BB SNEAKED UP BEHIND HER AND SET FIRE TO IT WITH A BOX OF MATCHES
BURNED HER QUITE BADLY I BELIEVE LITTLE BEGGARS EH BUT KEEN AS MUSTARD
THATS A FIRSTRATE TRAINING THEY GIVE THEM IN THE SPIES NOWADAYSBETTER
THAN IN MY DAY EVEN WHAT DYOU THINKS THE LATEST THING THEYVE SERVED
THEM OUT WITH EAR TRUMPETS FOR LISTENING THROUGH KEYHOLES MY LITTLE
GIRL BROUGHT ONE HOME THE OTHER NIGHTTRIED IT OUT ON OUR SITTINGROOM
DOOR AND RECKONED SHE COULD HEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS WITH HER EAR TO THE
HOLE OF COURSE ITS ONLY A TOY MIND YOU STILL GIVES EM THE RIGHT
IDEA EH

AT THIS MOMENT THE TELESCREEN LET OUT A PIERCING WHISTLE IT WAS THE
SIGNAL TO RETURN TO WORK ALL THREE MEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET TO JOIN IN
THE STRUGGLE ROUND THE LIFTS AND THE REMAINING TOBACCO FELL OUT OF
WINSTONS CIGARETTE




CHAPTER 6



WINSTON WAS WRITING IN HIS DIARY


IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO IT WAS ON A DARK EVENING IN A NARROW
SIDESTREET NEAR ONE OF THE BIG RAILWAY STATIONS SHE WAS STANDING NEAR A
DOORWAY IN THE WALL UNDER A STREET LAMP THAT HARDLY GAVE ANY LIGHT SHE
HAD A YOUNG FACE PAINTED VERY THICK IT WAS REALLY THE PAINT THAT APPEALED
TO ME THE WHITENESS OF IT LIKE A MASK AND THE BRIGHT RED LIPS PARTY
WOMEN NEVER PAINT THEIR FACES THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN THE STREET AND NO
TELESCREENS SHE SAID TWO DOLLARS I


FOR THE MOMENT IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO GO ON HE SHUT HIS EYES AND PRESSED
HIS FINGERS AGAINST THEM TRYING TO SQUEEZE OUT THE VISION THAT KEPT
RECURRING HE HAD AN ALMOST OVERWHELMING TEMPTATION TO SHOUT A STRING OF
FILTHY WORDS AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE OR TO BANG HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
TO KICK OVER THE TABLE AND HURL THE INKPOT THROUGH THE WINDOWTO DO ANY
VIOLENT OR NOISY OR PAINFUL THING THAT MIGHT BLACK OUT THE MEMORY THAT WAS
TORMENTING HIM

YOUR WORST ENEMY HE REFLECTED WAS YOUR OWN NERVOUS SYSTEM AT ANY MOMENT
THE TENSION INSIDE YOU WAS LIABLE TO TRANSLATE ITSELF INTO SOME VISIBLE
SYMPTOM HE THOUGHT OF A MAN WHOM HE HAD PASSED IN THE STREET A FEW WEEKS
BACK A QUITE ORDINARYLOOKING MAN A PARTY MEMBER AGED THIRTYFIVE TO
FORTY TALLISH AND THIN CARRYING A BRIEFCASE THEY WERE A FEW METRES
APART WHEN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MANS FACE WAS SUDDENLY CONTORTED BY A SORT
OF SPASM IT HAPPENED AGAIN JUST AS THEY WERE PASSING ONE ANOTHER IT WAS
ONLY A TWITCH A QUIVER RAPID AS THE CLICKING OF A CAMERA SHUTTER BUT
OBVIOUSLY HABITUAL HE REMEMBERED THINKING AT THE TIME THAT POOR DEVIL IS
DONE FOR AND WHAT WAS FRIGHTENING WAS THAT THE ACTION WAS QUITE POSSIBLY
UNCONSCIOUS THE MOST DEADLY DANGER OF ALL WAS TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP THERE
WAS NO WAY OF GUARDING AGAINST THAT SO FAR AS HE COULD SEE

HE DREW HIS BREATH AND WENT ON WRITING


I WENT WITH HER THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND ACROSS A BACKYARD INTO A
BASEMENT KITCHEN THERE WAS A BED AGAINST THE WALL AND A LAMP ON THE
TABLE TURNED DOWN VERY LOW SHE


HIS TEETH WERE SET ON EDGE HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SPIT SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH THE WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT KITCHEN HE THOUGHT OF KATHARINE HIS WIFE
WINSTON WAS MARRIEDHAD BEEN MARRIED AT ANY RATE PROBABLY HE STILL WAS
MARRIED SO FAR AS HE KNEW HIS WIFE WAS NOT DEAD HE SEEMED TO BREATHE
AGAIN THE WARM STUFFY ODOUR OF THE BASEMENT KITCHEN AN ODOUR COMPOUNDED
OF BUGS AND DIRTY CLOTHES AND VILLAINOUS CHEAP SCENT BUT NEVERTHELESS
ALLURING BECAUSE NO WOMAN OF THE PARTY EVER USED SCENT OR COULD BE
IMAGINED AS DOING SO ONLY THE PROLES USED SCENT IN HIS MIND THE SMELL
OF IT WAS INEXTRICABLY MIXED UP WITH FORNICATION

WHEN HE HAD GONE WITH THAT WOMAN IT HAD BEEN HIS FIRST LAPSE IN TWO YEARS
OR THEREABOUTS CONSORTING WITH PROSTITUTES WAS FORBIDDEN OF COURSE BUT
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE RULES THAT YOU COULD OCCASIONALLY NERVE YOURSELF TO
BREAK IT WAS DANGEROUS BUT IT WAS NOT A LIFEANDDEATH MATTER TO BE
CAUGHT WITH A PROSTITUTE MIGHT MEAN FIVE YEARS IN A FORCEDLABOUR CAMP
NOT MORE IF YOU HAD COMMITTED NO OTHER OFFENCE AND IT WAS EASY ENOUGH
PROVIDED THAT YOU COULD AVOID BEING CAUGHT IN THE ACT THE POORER QUARTERS
SWARMED WITH WOMEN WHO WERE READY TO SELL THEMSELVES SOME COULD EVEN BE
PURCHASED FOR A BOTTLE OF GIN WHICH THE PROLES WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK
TACITLY THE PARTY WAS EVEN INCLINED TO ENCOURAGE PROSTITUTION AS AN OUTLET
FOR INSTINCTS WHICH COULD NOT BE ALTOGETHER SUPPRESSED MERE DEBAUCHERY
DID NOT MATTER VERY MUCH SO LONG AS IT WAS FURTIVE AND JOYLESS AND ONLY
INVOLVED THE WOMEN OF A SUBMERGED AND DESPISED CLASS THE UNFORGIVABLE
CRIME WAS PROMISCUITY BETWEEN PARTY MEMBERS BUTTHOUGH THIS WAS ONE
OF THE CRIMES THAT THE ACCUSED IN THE GREAT PURGES INVARIABLY CONFESSED
TOIT WAS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE ANY SUCH THING ACTUALLY HAPPENING

THE AIM OF THE PARTY WAS NOT MERELY TO PREVENT MEN AND WOMEN FROM FORMING
LOYALTIES WHICH IT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL ITS REAL UNDECLARED
PURPOSE WAS TO REMOVE ALL PLEASURE FROM THE SEXUAL ACT NOT LOVE SO MUCH
AS EROTICISM WAS THE ENEMY INSIDE MARRIAGE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE IT ALL
MARRIAGES BETWEEN PARTY MEMBERS HAD TO BE APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE
APPOINTED FOR THE PURPOSE ANDTHOUGH THE PRINCIPLE WAS NEVER CLEARLY
STATEDPERMISSION WAS ALWAYS REFUSED IF THE COUPLE CONCERNED GAVE
THE IMPRESSION OF BEING PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO ONE ANOTHER THE ONLY
RECOGNIZED PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE WAS TO BEGET CHILDREN FOR THE SERVICE OF
THE PARTY SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WAS TO BE LOOKED ON AS A SLIGHTLY DISGUSTING
MINOR OPERATION LIKE HAVING AN ENEMA THIS AGAIN WAS NEVER PUT INTO PLAIN
WORDS BUT IN AN INDIRECT WAY IT WAS RUBBED INTO EVERY PARTY MEMBER FROM
CHILDHOOD ONWARDS THERE WERE EVEN ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE JUNIOR
ANTISEX LEAGUE WHICH ADVOCATED COMPLETE CELIBACY FOR BOTH SEXES ALL
CHILDREN WERE TO BE BEGOTTEN BY ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION ARTSEM IT WAS
CALLED IN NEWSPEAK AND BROUGHT UP IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THIS WINSTON
WAS AWARE WAS NOT MEANT ALTOGETHER SERIOUSLY BUT SOMEHOW IT FITTED IN
WITH THE GENERAL IDEOLOGY OF THE PARTY THE PARTY WAS TRYING TO KILL THE
SEX INSTINCT OR IF IT COULD NOT BE KILLED THEN TO DISTORT IT AND DIRTY
IT HE DID NOT KNOW WHY THIS WAS SO BUT IT SEEMED NATURAL THAT IT SHOULD
BE SO AND AS FAR AS THE WOMEN WERE CONCERNED THE PARTYS EFFORTS WERE
LARGELY SUCCESSFUL

HE THOUGHT AGAIN OF KATHARINE IT MUST BE NINE TENNEARLY ELEVEN YEARS
SINCE THEY HAD PARTED IT WAS CURIOUS HOW SELDOM HE THOUGHT OF HER FOR
DAYS AT A TIME HE WAS CAPABLE OF FORGETTING THAT HE HAD EVER BEEN MARRIED
THEY HAD ONLY BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MONTHS THE PARTY DID NOT
PERMIT DIVORCE BUT IT RATHER ENCOURAGED SEPARATION IN CASES WHERE THERE
WERE NO CHILDREN

KATHARINE WAS A TALL FAIRHAIRED GIRL VERY STRAIGHT WITH SPLENDID
MOVEMENTS SHE HAD A BOLD AQUILINE FACE A FACE THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE CALLED
NOBLE UNTIL ONE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE NOTHING
BEHIND IT VERY EARLY IN HER MARRIED LIFE HE HAD DECIDEDTHOUGH PERHAPS
IT WAS ONLY THAT HE KNEW HER MORE INTIMATELY THAN HE KNEW MOST PEOPLETHAT
SHE HAD WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST STUPID VULGAR EMPTY MIND THAT HE HAD
EVER ENCOUNTERED SHE HAD NOT A THOUGHT IN HER HEAD THAT WAS NOT A SLOGAN
AND THERE WAS NO IMBECILITY ABSOLUTELY NONE THAT SHE WAS NOT CAPABLE OF
SWALLOWING IF THE PARTY HANDED IT OUT TO HER THE HUMAN SOUNDTRACK HE
NICKNAMED HER IN HIS OWN MIND YET HE COULD HAVE ENDURED LIVING WITH HER
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR JUST ONE THINGSEX

AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED HER SHE SEEMED TO WINCE AND STIFFEN TO EMBRACE HER
WAS LIKE EMBRACING A JOINTED WOODEN IMAGE AND WHAT WAS STRANGE WAS THAT
EVEN WHEN SHE WAS CLASPING HIM AGAINST HER HE HAD THE FEELING THAT SHE
WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY PUSHING HIM AWAY WITH ALL HER STRENGTH THE RIGIDITY
OF HER MUSCLES MANAGED TO CONVEY THAT IMPRESSION SHE WOULD LIE THERE
WITH SHUT EYES NEITHER RESISTING NOR COOPERATING BUT SUBMITTING IT WAS
EXTRAORDINARILY EMBARRASSING AND AFTER A WHILE HORRIBLE BUT EVEN THEN
HE COULD HAVE BORNE LIVING WITH HER IF IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD
REMAIN CELIBATE BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH IT WAS KATHARINE WHO REFUSED THIS
THEY MUST SHE SAID PRODUCE A CHILD IF THEY COULD SO THE PERFORMANCE
CONTINUED TO HAPPEN ONCE A WEEK QUITE REGULARLY WHENEVER IT WAS NOT
IMPOSSIBLE SHE EVEN USED TO REMIND HIM OF IT IN THE MORNING AS SOMETHING
WHICH HAD TO BE DONE THAT EVENING AND WHICH MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN SHE HAD
TWO NAMES FOR IT ONE WAS MAKING A BABY AND THE OTHER WAS OUR DUTY TO
THE PARTY YES SHE HAD ACTUALLY USED THAT PHRASE QUITE SOON HE GREW TO
HAVE A FEELING OF POSITIVE DREAD WHEN THE APPOINTED DAY CAME ROUND BUT
LUCKILY NO CHILD APPEARED AND IN THE END SHE AGREED TO GIVE UP TRYING
AND SOON AFTERWARDS THEY PARTED

WINSTON SIGHED INAUDIBLY HE PICKED UP HIS PEN AGAIN AND
WROTE


SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN ON THE BED AND AT ONCE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF
PRELIMINARY IN THE MOST COARSE HORRIBLE WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE PULLED UP
HER SKIRT I


HE SAW HIMSELF STANDING THERE IN THE DIM LAMPLIGHT WITH THE SMELL OF BUGS
AND CHEAP SCENT IN HIS NOSTRILS AND IN HIS HEART A FEELING OF DEFEAT AND
RESENTMENT WHICH EVEN AT THAT MOMENT WAS MIXED UP WITH THE THOUGHT OF
KATHARINES WHITE BODY FROZEN FOR EVER BY THE HYPNOTIC POWER OF THE PARTY
WHY DID IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS WHY COULD HE NOT HAVE A WOMAN OF
HIS OWN INSTEAD OF THESE FILTHY SCUFFLES AT INTERVALS OF YEARS BUT A REAL
LOVE AFFAIR WAS AN ALMOST UNTHINKABLE EVENT THE WOMEN OF THE PARTY WERE
ALL ALIKE CHASTITY WAS AS DEEP INGRAINED IN THEM AS PARTY LOYALTY BY
CAREFUL EARLY CONDITIONING BY GAMES AND COLD WATER BY THE RUBBISH THAT
WAS DINNED INTO THEM AT SCHOOL AND IN THE SPIES AND THE YOUTH LEAGUE BY
LECTURES PARADES SONGS SLOGANS AND MARTIAL MUSIC THE NATURAL FEELING
HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THEM HIS REASON TOLD HIM THAT THERE MUST BE
EXCEPTIONS BUT HIS HEART DID NOT BELIEVE IT THEY WERE ALL IMPREGNABLE
AS THE PARTY INTENDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE AND WHAT HE WANTED MORE EVEN
THAN TO BE LOVED WAS TO BREAK DOWN THAT WALL OF VIRTUE EVEN IF IT WERE
ONLY ONCE IN HIS WHOLE LIFE THE SEXUAL ACT SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED WAS
REBELLION DESIRE WAS THOUGHTCRIME EVEN TO HAVE AWAKENED KATHARINE IF HE
COULD HAVE ACHIEVED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A SEDUCTION ALTHOUGH SHE WAS
HIS WIFE

BUT THE REST OF THE STORY HAD GOT TO BE WRITTEN DOWN HE WROTE


I TURNED UP THE LAMP WHEN I SAW HER IN THE LIGHT


AFTER THE DARKNESS THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF THE PARAFFIN LAMP HAD SEEMED VERY
BRIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE COULD SEE THE WOMAN PROPERLY HE HAD TAKEN A
STEP TOWARDS HER AND THEN HALTED FULL OF LUST AND TERROR HE WAS PAINFULLY
CONSCIOUS OF THE RISK HE HAD TAKEN IN COMING HERE IT WAS PERFECTLY
POSSIBLE THAT THE PATROLS WOULD CATCH HIM ON THE WAY OUT FOR THAT MATTER
THEY MIGHT BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR AT THIS MOMENT IF HE WENT AWAY
WITHOUT EVEN DOING WHAT HE HAD COME HERE TO DO

IT HAD GOT TO BE WRITTEN DOWN IT HAD GOT TO BE CONFESSED WHAT HE HAD
SUDDENLY SEEN IN THE LAMPLIGHT WAS THAT THE WOMAN WAS OLD THE PAINT WAS
PLASTERED SO THICK ON HER FACE THAT IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT CRACK
LIKE A CARDBOARD MASK THERE WERE STREAKS OF WHITE IN HER HAIR BUT THE
TRULY DREADFUL DETAIL WAS THAT HER MOUTH HAD FALLEN A LITTLE OPEN
REVEALING NOTHING EXCEPT A CAVERNOUS BLACKNESS SHE HAD NO TEETH AT ALL

HE WROTE HURRIEDLY IN SCRABBLING HANDWRITING


WHEN I SAW HER IN THE LIGHT SHE WAS QUITE AN OLD WOMAN FIFTY YEARS OLD
AT LEAST BUT I WENT AHEAD AND DID IT JUST THE SAME


HE PRESSED HIS FINGERS AGAINST HIS EYELIDS AGAIN HE HAD WRITTEN IT DOWN
AT LAST BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THE THERAPY HAD NOT WORKED THE URGE
TO SHOUT FILTHY WORDS AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE WAS AS STRONG AS EVER




CHAPTER 7



IF THERE IS HOPE WROTE WINSTON IT LIES IN THE PROLES

IF THERE WAS HOPE IT MUST LIE IN THE PROLES BECAUSE ONLY THERE IN THOSE
SWARMING DISREGARDED MASSES 85 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF OCEANIA
COULD THE FORCE TO DESTROY THE PARTY EVER BE GENERATED THE PARTY COULD
NOT BE OVERTHROWN FROM WITHIN ITS ENEMIES IF IT HAD ANY ENEMIES HAD
NO WAY OF COMING TOGETHER OR EVEN OF IDENTIFYING ONE ANOTHER EVEN IF
THE LEGENDARY BROTHERHOOD EXISTED AS JUST POSSIBLY IT MIGHT IT WAS
INCONCEIVABLE THAT ITS MEMBERS COULD EVER ASSEMBLE IN LARGER NUMBERS THAN
TWOS AND THREES REBELLION MEANT A LOOK IN THE EYES AN INFLEXION OF THE
VOICE AT THE MOST AN OCCASIONAL WHISPERED WORD BUT THE PROLES IF ONLY
THEY COULD SOMEHOW BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN STRENGTH WOULD HAVE NO
NEED TO CONSPIRE THEY NEEDED ONLY TO RISE UP AND SHAKE THEMSELVES LIKE
A HORSE SHAKING OFF FLIES IF THEY CHOSE THEY COULD BLOW THE PARTY TO
PIECES TOMORROW MORNING SURELY SOONER OR LATER IT MUST OCCUR TO THEM TO
DO IT AND YET

HE REMEMBERED HOW ONCE HE HAD BEEN WALKING DOWN A CROWDED STREET WHEN A
TREMENDOUS SHOUT OF HUNDREDS OF VOICES WOMENS VOICESHAD BURST FROM A
SIDESTREET A LITTLE WAY AHEAD IT WAS A GREAT FORMIDABLE CRY OF ANGER
AND DESPAIR A DEEP LOUD OHOOOOH THAT WENT HUMMING ON LIKE THE
REVERBERATION OF A BELL HIS HEART HAD LEAPT ITS STARTED HE HAD THOUGHT
A RIOT THE PROLES ARE BREAKING LOOSE AT LAST WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE SPOT
IT WAS TO SEE A MOB OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED WOMEN CROWDING ROUND THE STALLS
OF A STREET MARKET WITH FACES AS TRAGIC AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN THE DOOMED
PASSENGERS ON A SINKING SHIP BUT AT THIS MOMENT THE GENERAL DESPAIR BROKE
DOWN INTO A MULTITUDE OF INDIVIDUAL QUARRELS IT APPEARED THAT ONE OF THE
STALLS HAD BEEN SELLING TIN SAUCEPANS THEY WERE WRETCHED FLIMSY THINGS
BUT COOKINGPOTS OF ANY KIND WERE ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO GET NOW THE SUPPLY
HAD UNEXPECTEDLY GIVEN OUT THE SUCCESSFUL WOMEN BUMPED AND JOSTLED BY
THE REST WERE TRYING TO MAKE OFF WITH THEIR SAUCEPANS WHILE DOZENS OF
OTHERS CLAMOURED ROUND THE STALL ACCUSING THE STALLKEEPER OF FAVOURITISM
AND OF HAVING MORE SAUCEPANS SOMEWHERE IN RESERVE THERE WAS A FRESH
OUTBURST OF YELLS TWO BLOATED WOMEN ONE OF THEM WITH HER HAIR COMING
DOWN HAD GOT HOLD OF THE SAME SAUCEPAN AND WERE TRYING TO TEAR IT OUT OF
ONE ANOTHERS HANDS FOR A MOMENT THEY WERE BOTH TUGGING AND THEN THE
HANDLE CAME OFF WINSTON WATCHED THEM DISGUSTEDLY AND YET JUST FOR A
MOMENT WHAT ALMOST FRIGHTENING POWER HAD SOUNDED IN THAT CRY FROM ONLY
A FEW HUNDRED THROATS WHY WAS IT THAT THEY COULD NEVER SHOUT LIKE THAT
ABOUT ANYTHING THAT MATTERED

HE WROTE


UNTIL THEY BECOME CONSCIOUS THEY WILL NEVER REBEL AND UNTIL AFTER THEY
HAVE REBELLED THEY CANNOT BECOME CONSCIOUS


THAT HE REFLECTED MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN A TRANSCRIPTION FROM ONE OF THE
PARTY TEXTBOOKS THE PARTY CLAIMED OF COURSE TO HAVE LIBERATED THE PROLES
FROM BONDAGE BEFORE THE REVOLUTION THEY HAD BEEN HIDEOUSLY OPPRESSED BY
THE CAPITALISTS THEY HAD BEEN STARVED AND FLOGGED WOMEN HAD BEEN FORCED
TO WORK IN THE COAL MINES WOMEN STILL DID WORK IN THE COAL MINES AS A
MATTER OF FACT CHILDREN HAD BEEN SOLD INTO THE FACTORIES AT THE AGE
OF SIX BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY TRUE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF DOUBLETHINK THE
PARTY TAUGHT THAT THE PROLES WERE NATURAL INFERIORS WHO MUST BE KEPT IN
SUBJECTION LIKE ANIMALS BY THE APPLICATION OF A FEW SIMPLE RULES IN
REALITY VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROLES IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO
KNOW MUCH SO LONG AS THEY CONTINUED TO WORK AND BREED THEIR OTHER
ACTIVITIES WERE WITHOUT IMPORTANCE LEFT TO THEMSELVES LIKE CATTLE TURNED
LOOSE UPON THE PLAINS OF ARGENTINA THEY HAD REVERTED TO A STYLE OF LIFE
THAT APPEARED TO BE NATURAL TO THEM A SORT OF ANCESTRAL PATTERN THEY WERE
BORN THEY GREW UP IN THE GUTTERS THEY WENT TO WORK AT TWELVE THEY PASSED
THROUGH A BRIEF BLOSSOMINGPERIOD OF BEAUTY AND SEXUAL DESIRE THEY MARRIED
AT TWENTY THEY WERE MIDDLEAGED AT THIRTY THEY DIED FOR THE MOST PART
AT SIXTY HEAVY PHYSICAL WORK THE CARE OF HOME AND CHILDREN PETTY
QUARRELS WITH NEIGHBOURS FILMS FOOTBALL BEER AND ABOVE ALL GAMBLING
FILLED UP THE HORIZON OF THEIR MINDS TO KEEP THEM IN CONTROL WAS NOT
DIFFICULT A FEW AGENTS OF THE THOUGHT POLICE MOVED ALWAYS AMONG THEM
SPREADING FALSE RUMOURS AND MARKING DOWN AND ELIMINATING THE FEW
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE JUDGED CAPABLE OF BECOMING DANGEROUS BUT NO ATTEMPT
WAS MADE TO INDOCTRINATE THEM WITH THE IDEOLOGY OF THE PARTY IT WAS NOT
DESIRABLE THAT THE PROLES SHOULD HAVE STRONG POLITICAL FEELINGS ALL THAT
WAS REQUIRED OF THEM WAS A PRIMITIVE PATRIOTISM WHICH COULD BE APPEALED TO
WHENEVER IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM ACCEPT LONGER WORKINGHOURS OR
SHORTER RATIONS AND EVEN WHEN THEY BECAME DISCONTENTED AS THEY SOMETIMES
DID THEIR DISCONTENT LED NOWHERE BECAUSE BEING WITHOUT GENERAL IDEAS
THEY COULD ONLY FOCUS IT ON PETTY SPECIFIC GRIEVANCES THE LARGER EVILS
INVARIABLY ESCAPED THEIR NOTICE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PROLES DID NOT EVEN
HAVE TELESCREENS IN THEIR HOMES EVEN THE CIVIL POLICE INTERFERED WITH THEM
VERY LITTLE THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF CRIMINALITY IN LONDON A WHOLE
WORLDWITHINAWORLD OF THIEVES BANDITS PROSTITUTES DRUGPEDDLERS AND
RACKETEERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION BUT SINCE IT ALL HAPPENED AMONG THE PROLES
THEMSELVES IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE IN ALL QUESTIONS OF MORALS THEY WERE
ALLOWED TO FOLLOW THEIR ANCESTRAL CODE THE SEXUAL PURITANISM OF THE
PARTY WAS NOT IMPOSED UPON THEM PROMISCUITY WENT UNPUNISHED DIVORCE
WAS PERMITTED FOR THAT MATTER EVEN RELIGIOUS WORSHIP WOULD HAVE BEEN
PERMITTED IF THE PROLES HAD SHOWN ANY SIGN OF NEEDING OR WANTING IT
THEY WERE BENEATH SUSPICION AS THE PARTY SLOGAN PUT IT PROLES AND
ANIMALS ARE FREE

WINSTON REACHED DOWN AND CAUTIOUSLY SCRATCHED HIS VARICOSE ULCER IT
HAD BEGUN ITCHING AGAIN THE THING YOU INVARIABLY CAME BACK TO WAS THE
IMPOSSIBILITY OF KNOWING WHAT LIFE BEFORE THE REVOLUTION HAD REALLY BEEN
LIKE HE TOOK OUT OF THE DRAWER A COPY OF A CHILDRENS HISTORY TEXTBOOK
WHICH HE HAD BORROWED FROM MRS PARSONS AND BEGAN COPYING A PASSAGE INTO
THE DIARY


IN THE OLD DAYS IT RAN BEFORE THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION LONDON WAS
NOT THE BEAUTIFUL CITY THAT WE KNOW TODAY IT WAS A DARK DIRTY MISERABLE
PLACE WHERE HARDLY ANYBODY HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND WHERE HUNDREDS AND
THOUSANDS OF POOR PEOPLE HAD NO BOOTS ON THEIR FEET AND NOT EVEN A ROOF TO
SLEEP UNDER CHILDREN NO OLDER THAN YOU HAD TO WORK TWELVE HOURS A DAY FOR
CRUEL MASTERS WHO FLOGGED THEM WITH WHIPS IF THEY WORKED TOO SLOWLY AND
FED THEM ON NOTHING BUT STALE BREADCRUSTS AND WATER BUT IN AMONG ALL
THIS TERRIBLE POVERTY THERE WERE JUST A FEW GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL HOUSES
THAT WERE LIVED IN BY RICH MEN WHO HAD AS MANY AS THIRTY SERVANTS TO LOOK
AFTER THEM THESE RICH MEN WERE CALLED CAPITALISTS THEY WERE FAT UGLY
MEN WITH WICKED FACES LIKE THE ONE IN THE PICTURE ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS DRESSED IN A LONG BLACK COAT WHICH WAS CALLED A
FROCK COAT AND A QUEER SHINY HAT SHAPED LIKE A STOVEPIPE WHICH WAS
CALLED A TOP HAT THIS WAS THE UNIFORM OF THE CAPITALISTS AND NO ONE ELSE
WAS ALLOWED TO WEAR IT THE CAPITALISTS OWNED EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND
EVERYONE ELSE WAS THEIR SLAVE THEY OWNED ALL THE LAND ALL THE HOUSES
ALL THE FACTORIES AND ALL THE MONEY IF ANYONE DISOBEYED THEM THEY COULD
THROW THEM INTO PRISON OR THEY COULD TAKE HIS JOB AWAY AND STARVE HIM TO
DEATH WHEN ANY ORDINARY PERSON SPOKE TO A CAPITALIST HE HAD TO CRINGE AND
BOW TO HIM AND TAKE OFF HIS CAP AND ADDRESS HIM AS SIR THE CHIEF OF
ALL THE CAPITALISTS WAS CALLED THE KING AND


BUT HE KNEW THE REST OF THE CATALOGUE THERE WOULD BE MENTION OF THE
BISHOPS IN THEIR LAWN SLEEVES THE JUDGES IN THEIR ERMINE ROBES THE
PILLORY THE STOCKS THE TREADMILL THE CATONINE TAILS THE LORD MAYORS
BANQUET AND THE PRACTICE OF KISSING THE POPES TOE THERE WAS ALSO
SOMETHING CALLED THE JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS WHICH WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE
MENTIONED IN A TEXTBOOK FOR CHILDREN IT WAS THE LAW BY WHICH EVERY
CAPITALIST HAD THE RIGHT TO SLEEP WITH ANY WOMAN WORKING IN ONE OF HIS
FACTORIES

HOW COULD YOU TELL HOW MUCH OF IT WAS LIES IT MIGHT BE TRUE THAT THE
AVERAGE HUMAN BEING WAS BETTER OFF NOW THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE THE
REVOLUTION THE ONLY EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY WAS THE MUTE PROTEST IN YOUR
OWN BONES THE INSTINCTIVE FEELING THAT THE CONDITIONS YOU LIVED IN WERE
INTOLERABLE AND THAT AT SOME OTHER TIME THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IT
STRUCK HIM THAT THE TRULY CHARACTERISTIC THING ABOUT MODERN LIFE WAS NOT
ITS CRUELTY AND INSECURITY BUT SIMPLY ITS BARENESS ITS DINGINESS ITS
LISTLESSNESS LIFE IF YOU LOOKED ABOUT YOU BORE NO RESEMBLANCE NOT ONLY
TO THE LIES THAT STREAMED OUT OF THE TELESCREENS BUT EVEN TO THE IDEALS
THAT THE PARTY WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE GREAT AREAS OF IT EVEN FOR A PARTY
MEMBER WERE NEUTRAL AND NONPOLITICAL A MATTER OF SLOGGING THROUGH DREARY
JOBS FIGHTING FOR A PLACE ON THE TUBE DARNING A WORNOUT SOCK CADGING
A SACCHARINE TABLET SAVING A CIGARETTE END THE IDEAL SET UP BY THE
PARTY WAS SOMETHING HUGE TERRIBLE AND GLITTERINGA WORLD OF STEEL
AND CONCRETE OF MONSTROUS MACHINES AND TERRIFYING WEAPONSA NATION OF
WARRIORS AND FANATICS MARCHING FORWARD IN PERFECT UNITY ALL THINKING THE
SAME THOUGHTS AND SHOUTING THE SAME SLOGANS PERPETUALLY WORKING FIGHTING
TRIUMPHING PERSECUTINGTHREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE ALL WITH THE SAME
FACE THE REALITY WAS DECAYING DINGY CITIES WHERE UNDERFED PEOPLE SHUFFLED
TO AND FRO IN LEAKY SHOES IN PATCHEDUP NINETEENTHCENTURY HOUSES THAT
SMELT ALWAYS OF CABBAGE AND BAD LAVATORIES HE SEEMED TO SEE A VISION OF
LONDON VAST AND RUINOUS CITY OF A MILLION DUSTBINS AND MIXED UP WITH IT
WAS A PICTURE OF MRS PARSONS A WOMAN WITH LINED FACE AND WISPY HAIR
FIDDLING HELPLESSLY WITH A BLOCKED WASTEPIPE

HE REACHED DOWN AND SCRATCHED HIS ANKLE AGAIN DAY AND NIGHT THE
TELESCREENS BRUISED YOUR EARS WITH STATISTICS PROVING THAT PEOPLE TODAY
HAD MORE FOOD MORE CLOTHES BETTER HOUSES BETTER RECREATIONSTHAT THEY
LIVED LONGER WORKED SHORTER HOURS WERE BIGGER HEALTHIER STRONGER
HAPPIER MORE INTELLIGENT BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE PEOPLE OF FIFTY YEARS
AGO NOT A WORD OF IT COULD EVER BE PROVED OR DISPROVED THE PARTY CLAIMED
FOR EXAMPLE THAT TODAY 40 PER CENT OF ADULT PROLES WERE LITERATE BEFORE
THE REVOLUTION IT WAS SAID THE NUMBER HAD ONLY BEEN 15 PER CENT THE
PARTY CLAIMED THAT THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE WAS NOW ONLY 160 PER
THOUSAND WHEREAS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION IT HAD BEEN 300AND SO IT WENT
ON IT WAS LIKE A SINGLE EQUATION WITH TWO UNKNOWNS IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE
THAT LITERALLY EVERY WORD IN THE HISTORY BOOKS EVEN THE THINGS THAT ONE
ACCEPTED WITHOUT QUESTION WAS PURE FANTASY FOR ALL HE KNEW THERE MIGHT
NEVER HAVE BEEN ANY SUCH LAW AS THE JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS OR ANY SUCH CREATURE
AS A CAPITALIST OR ANY SUCH GARMENT AS A TOP HAT

EVERYTHING FADED INTO MIST THE PAST WAS ERASED THE ERASURE WAS FORGOTTEN
THE LIE BECAME TRUTH JUST ONCE IN HIS LIFE HE HAD POSSESSEDAFTER THE
EVENT THAT WAS WHAT COUNTEDCONCRETE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF AN ACT OF
FALSIFICATION HE HAD HELD IT BETWEEN HIS FINGERS FOR AS LONG AS THIRTY
SECONDS IN 1973 IT MUST HAVE BEENAT ANY RATE IT WAS AT ABOUT THE TIME
WHEN HE AND KATHARINE HAD PARTED BUT THE REALLY RELEVANT DATE WAS SEVEN
OR EIGHT YEARS EARLIER

THE STORY REALLY BEGAN IN THE MIDDLE SIXTIES THE PERIOD OF THE GREAT
PURGES IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL LEADERS OF THE REVOLUTION WERE WIPED OUT
ONCE AND FOR ALL BY 1970 NONE OF THEM WAS LEFT EXCEPT BIG BROTHER
HIMSELF ALL THE REST HAD BY THAT TIME BEEN EXPOSED AS TRAITORS AND
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES GOLDSTEIN HAD FLED AND WAS HIDING NO ONE KNEW
WHERE AND OF THE OTHERS A FEW HAD SIMPLY DISAPPEARED WHILE THE MAJORITY
HAD BEEN EXECUTED AFTER SPECTACULAR PUBLIC TRIALS AT WHICH THEY MADE
CONFESSION OF THEIR CRIMES AMONG THE LAST SURVIVORS WERE THREE MEN NAMED
JONES AARONSON AND RUTHERFORD IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN 1965 THAT THESE THREE
HAD BEEN ARRESTED AS OFTEN HAPPENED THEY HAD VANISHED FOR A YEAR OR MORE
SO THAT ONE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE ALIVE OR DEAD AND THEN HAD
SUDDENLY BEEN BROUGHT FORTH TO INCRIMINATE THEMSELVES IN THE USUAL WAY
THEY HAD CONFESSED TO INTELLIGENCE WITH THE ENEMY AT THAT DATE TOO THE
ENEMY WAS EURASIA EMBEZZLEMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS THE MURDER OF VARIOUS
TRUSTED PARTY MEMBERS INTRIGUES AGAINST THE LEADERSHIP OF BIG BROTHER
WHICH HAD STARTED LONG BEFORE THE REVOLUTION HAPPENED AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE
CAUSING THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AFTER CONFESSING TO
THESE THINGS THEY HAD BEEN PARDONED REINSTATED IN THE PARTY AND GIVEN
POSTS WHICH WERE IN FACT SINECURES BUT WHICH SOUNDED IMPORTANT ALL THREE
HAD WRITTEN LONG ABJECT ARTICLES IN THE TIMES ANALYSING THE REASONS
FOR THEIR DEFECTION AND PROMISING TO MAKE AMENDS

SOME TIME AFTER THEIR RELEASE WINSTON HAD ACTUALLY SEEN ALL THREE OF THEM
IN THE CHESTNUT TREE CAFE HE REMEMBERED THE SORT OF TERRIFIED FASCINATION
WITH WHICH HE HAD WATCHED THEM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE THEY WERE MEN
FAR OLDER THAN HIMSELF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD ALMOST THE LAST GREAT
FIGURES LEFT OVER FROM THE HEROIC DAYS OF THE PARTY THE GLAMOUR OF THE
UNDERGROUND STRUGGLE AND THE CIVIL WAR STILL FAINTLY CLUNG TO THEM HE HAD
THE FEELING THOUGH ALREADY AT THAT TIME FACTS AND DATES WERE GROWING
BLURRY THAT HE HAD KNOWN THEIR NAMES YEARS EARLIER THAN HE HAD KNOWN THAT
OF BIG BROTHER BUT ALSO THEY WERE OUTLAWS ENEMIES UNTOUCHABLES DOOMED
WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY TO EXTINCTION WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO NO ONE WHO HAD
ONCE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE THOUGHT POLICE EVER ESCAPED IN THE END
THEY WERE CORPSES WAITING TO BE SENT BACK TO THE GRAVE

THERE WAS NO ONE AT ANY OF THE TABLES NEAREST TO THEM IT WAS NOT WISE
EVEN TO BE SEEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SUCH PEOPLE THEY WERE SITTING
IN SILENCE BEFORE GLASSES OF THE GIN FLAVOURED WITH CLOVES WHICH WAS THE
SPECIALITY OF THE CAFE OF THE THREE IT WAS RUTHERFORD WHOSE APPEARANCE
HAD MOST IMPRESSED WINSTON RUTHERFORD HAD ONCE BEEN A FAMOUS CARICATURIST
WHOSE BRUTAL CARTOONS HAD HELPED TO INFLAME POPULAR OPINION BEFORE AND
DURING THE REVOLUTION EVEN NOW AT LONG INTERVALS HIS CARTOONS WERE
APPEARING IN THE TIMES THEY WERE SIMPLY AN IMITATION OF HIS EARLIER
MANNER AND CURIOUSLY LIFELESS AND UNCONVINCING ALWAYS THEY WERE A
REHASHING OF THE ANCIENT THEMESSLUM TENEMENTS STARVING CHILDREN STREET
BATTLES CAPITALISTS IN TOP HATSEVEN ON THE BARRICADES THE CAPITALISTS
STILL SEEMED TO CLING TO THEIR TOP HATS AN ENDLESS HOPELESS EFFORT TO
GET BACK INTO THE PAST HE WAS A MONSTROUS MAN WITH A MANE OF GREASY
GREY HAIR HIS FACE POUCHED AND SEAMED WITH THICK NEGROID LIPS AT ONE
TIME HE MUST HAVE BEEN IMMENSELY STRONG NOW HIS GREAT BODY WAS SAGGING
SLOPING BULGING FALLING AWAY IN EVERY DIRECTION HE SEEMED TO BE BREAKING
UP BEFORE ONES EYES LIKE A MOUNTAIN CRUMBLING

IT WAS THE LONELY HOUR OF FIFTEEN WINSTON COULD NOT NOW REMEMBER HOW HE
HAD COME TO BE IN THE CAFE AT SUCH A TIME THE PLACE WAS ALMOST EMPTY A
TINNY MUSIC WAS TRICKLING FROM THE TELESCREENS THE THREE MEN SAT IN THEIR
CORNER ALMOST MOTIONLESS NEVER SPEAKING UNCOMMANDED THE WAITER BROUGHT
FRESH GLASSES OF GIN THERE WAS A CHESSBOARD ON THE TABLE BESIDE THEM WITH
THE PIECES SET OUT BUT NO GAME STARTED AND THEN FOR PERHAPS HALF A MINUTE
IN ALL SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE TELESCREENS THE TUNE THAT THEY WERE
PLAYING CHANGED AND THE TONE OF THE MUSIC CHANGED TOO THERE CAME INTO
ITBUT IT WAS SOMETHING HARD TO DESCRIBE IT WAS A PECULIAR CRACKED
BRAYING JEERING NOTE IN HIS MIND WINSTON CALLED IT A YELLOW NOTE AND
THEN A VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN WAS SINGING


UNDER THE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREE
I SOLD YOU AND YOU SOLD ME
THERE LIE THEY AND HERE LIE WE
UNDER THE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREE


THE THREE MEN NEVER STIRRED BUT WHEN WINSTON GLANCED AGAIN AT RUTHERFORDS
RUINOUS FACE HE SAW THAT HIS EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME HE NOTICED WITH A KIND OF INWARD SHUDDER AND YET NOT KNOWING
AT WHAT HE SHUDDERED THAT BOTH AARONSON AND RUTHERFORD HAD BROKEN NOSES

A LITTLE LATER ALL THREE WERE REARRESTED IT APPEARED THAT THEY HAD
ENGAGED IN FRESH CONSPIRACIES FROM THE VERY MOMENT OF THEIR RELEASE AT
THEIR SECOND TRIAL THEY CONFESSED TO ALL THEIR OLD CRIMES OVER AGAIN WITH
A WHOLE STRING OF NEW ONES THEY WERE EXECUTED AND THEIR FATE WAS RECORDED
IN THE PARTY HISTORIES A WARNING TO POSTERITY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AFTER
THIS IN 1973 WINSTON WAS UNROLLING A WAD OF DOCUMENTS WHICH HAD JUST
FLOPPED OUT OF THE PNEUMATIC TUBE ON TO HIS DESK WHEN HE CAME ON A FRAGMENT
OF PAPER WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SLIPPED IN AMONG THE OTHERS AND THEN
FORGOTTEN THE INSTANT HE HAD FLATTENED IT OUT HE SAW ITS SIGNIFICANCE
IT WAS A HALFPAGE TORN OUT OF THE TIMES OF ABOUT TEN YEARS EARLIERTHE
TOP HALF OF THE PAGE SO THAT IT INCLUDED THE DATEAND IT CONTAINED A
PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DELEGATES AT SOME PARTY FUNCTION IN NEW YORK PROMINENT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP WERE JONES AARONSON AND RUTHERFORD THERE WAS
NO MISTAKING THEM IN ANY CASE THEIR NAMES WERE IN THE CAPTION AT THE
BOTTOM

THE POINT WAS THAT AT BOTH TRIALS ALL THREE MEN HAD CONFESSED THAT ON THAT
DATE THEY HAD BEEN ON EURASIAN SOIL THEY HAD FLOWN FROM A SECRET AIRFIELD
IN CANADA TO A RENDEZVOUS SOMEWHERE IN SIBERIA AND HAD CONFERRED WITH
MEMBERS OF THE EURASIAN GENERAL STAFF TO WHOM THEY HAD BETRAYED IMPORTANT
MILITARY SECRETS THE DATE HAD STUCK IN WINSTONS MEMORY BECAUSE IT CHANCED
TO BE MIDSUMMER DAY BUT THE WHOLE STORY MUST BE ON RECORD IN COUNTLESS
OTHER PLACES AS WELL THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE CONCLUSION THE
CONFESSIONS WERE LIES

OF COURSE THIS WAS NOT IN ITSELF A DISCOVERY EVEN AT THAT TIME WINSTON
HAD NOT IMAGINED THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WIPED OUT IN THE PURGES HAD
ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE CRIMES THAT THEY WERE ACCUSED OF BUT THIS WAS
CONCRETE EVIDENCE IT WAS A FRAGMENT OF THE ABOLISHED PAST LIKE A FOSSIL
BONE WHICH TURNS UP IN THE WRONG STRATUM AND DESTROYS A GEOLOGICAL THEORY
IT WAS ENOUGH TO BLOW THE PARTY TO ATOMS IF IN SOME WAY IT COULD HAVE
BEEN PUBLISHED TO THE WORLD AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE MADE KNOWN

HE HAD GONE STRAIGHT ON WORKING AS SOON AS HE SAW WHAT THE PHOTOGRAPH
WAS AND WHAT IT MEANT HE HAD COVERED IT UP WITH ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER
LUCKILY WHEN HE UNROLLED IT IT HAD BEEN UPSIDEDOWN FROM THE POINT OF
VIEW OF THE TELESCREEN

HE TOOK HIS SCRIBBLING PAD ON HIS KNEE AND PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR SO AS
TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM THE TELESCREEN AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP YOUR FACE
EXPRESSIONLESS WAS NOT DIFFICULT AND EVEN YOUR BREATHING COULD BE
CONTROLLED WITH AN EFFORT BUT YOU COULD NOT CONTROL THE BEATING OF YOUR
HEART AND THE TELESCREEN WAS QUITE DELICATE ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE LET
WHAT HE JUDGED TO BE TEN MINUTES GO BY TORMENTED ALL THE WHILE BY THE
FEAR THAT SOME ACCIDENTA SUDDEN DRAUGHT BLOWING ACROSS HIS DESK FOR
INSTANCEWOULD BETRAY HIM THEN WITHOUT UNCOVERING IT AGAIN HE DROPPED
THE PHOTOGRAPH INTO THE MEMORY HOLE ALONG WITH SOME OTHER WASTE PAPERS
WITHIN ANOTHER MINUTE PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE CRUMBLED INTO ASHES

THAT WAS TENELEVEN YEARS AGO TODAY PROBABLY HE WOULD HAVE KEPT THAT
PHOTOGRAPH IT WAS CURIOUS THAT THE FACT OF HAVING HELD IT IN HIS FINGERS
SEEMED TO HIM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE EVEN NOW WHEN THE PHOTOGRAPH ITSELF
AS WELL AS THE EVENT IT RECORDED WAS ONLY MEMORY WAS THE PARTYS HOLD
UPON THE PAST LESS STRONG HE WONDERED BECAUSE A PIECE OF EVIDENCE WHICH
EXISTED NO LONGER HAD ONCE EXISTED

BUT TODAY SUPPOSING THAT IT COULD BE SOMEHOW RESURRECTED FROM ITS ASHES
THE PHOTOGRAPH MIGHT NOT EVEN BE EVIDENCE ALREADY AT THE TIME WHEN HE
MADE HIS DISCOVERY OCEANIA WAS NO LONGER AT WAR WITH EURASIA AND IT MUST
HAVE BEEN TO THE AGENTS OF EASTASIA THAT THE THREE DEAD MEN HAD BETRAYED
THEIR COUNTRY SINCE THEN THERE HAD BEEN OTHER CHANGESTWO THREE
HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HOW MANY VERY LIKELY THE CONFESSIONS HAD BEEN
REWRITTEN AND REWRITTEN UNTIL THE ORIGINAL FACTS AND DATES NO LONGER
HAD THE SMALLEST SIGNIFICANCE THE PAST NOT ONLY CHANGED BUT CHANGED
CONTINUOUSLY WHAT MOST AFFLICTED HIM WITH THE SENSE OF NIGHTMARE WAS THAT
HE HAD NEVER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY THE HUGE IMPOSTURE WAS UNDERTAKEN
THE IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGES OF FALSIFYING THE PAST WERE OBVIOUS BUT THE
ULTIMATE MOTIVE WAS MYSTERIOUS HE TOOK UP HIS PEN AGAIN AND WROTE


I UNDERSTAND HOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY


HE WONDERED AS HE HAD MANY TIMES WONDERED BEFORE WHETHER HE HIMSELF WAS
A LUNATIC PERHAPS A LUNATIC WAS SIMPLY A MINORITY OF ONE AT ONE TIME IT
HAD BEEN A SIGN OF MADNESS TO BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH GOES ROUND THE SUN
TODAY TO BELIEVE THAT THE PAST IS UNALTERABLE HE MIGHT BE ALONE IN
HOLDING THAT BELIEF AND IF ALONE THEN A LUNATIC BUT THE THOUGHT OF BEING
A LUNATIC DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE HIM THE HORROR WAS THAT HE MIGHT ALSO
BE WRONG

HE PICKED UP THE CHILDRENS HISTORY BOOK AND LOOKED AT THE PORTRAIT OF
BIG BROTHER WHICH FORMED ITS FRONTISPIECE THE HYPNOTIC EYES GAZED INTO
HIS OWN IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME HUGE FORCE WERE PRESSING DOWN UPON
YOUSOMETHING THAT PENETRATED INSIDE YOUR SKULL BATTERING AGAINST YOUR
BRAIN FRIGHTENING YOU OUT OF YOUR BELIEFS PERSUADING YOU ALMOST TO
DENY THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR SENSES IN THE END THE PARTY WOULD ANNOUNCE THAT
TWO AND TWO MADE FIVE AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE IT IT WAS INEVITABLE
THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE THAT CLAIM SOONER OR LATER THE LOGIC OF THEIR
POSITION DEMANDED IT NOT MERELY THE VALIDITY OF EXPERIENCE BUT THE VERY
EXISTENCE OF EXTERNAL REALITY WAS TACITLY DENIED BY THEIR PHILOSOPHY THE
HERESY OF HERESIES WAS COMMON SENSE AND WHAT WAS TERRIFYING WAS NOT THAT
THEY WOULD KILL YOU FOR THINKING OTHERWISE BUT THAT THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT
FOR AFTER ALL HOW DO WE KNOW THAT TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR OR THAT THE
FORCE OF GRAVITY WORKS OR THAT THE PAST IS UNCHANGEABLE IF BOTH THE PAST
AND THE EXTERNAL WORLD EXIST ONLY IN THE MIND AND IF THE MIND ITSELF IS
CONTROLLABLE WHAT THEN

BUT NO HIS COURAGE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO STIFFEN OF ITS OWN ACCORD THE FACE
OF OBRIEN NOT CALLED UP BY ANY OBVIOUS ASSOCIATION HAD FLOATED INTO HIS
MIND HE KNEW WITH MORE CERTAINTY THAN BEFORE THAT OBRIEN WAS ON HIS
SIDE HE WAS WRITING THE DIARY FOR OBRIENTO OBRIEN IT WAS LIKE AN
INTERMINABLE LETTER WHICH NO ONE WOULD EVER READ BUT WHICH WAS ADDRESSED
TO A PARTICULAR PERSON AND TOOK ITS COLOUR FROM THAT FACT

THE PARTY TOLD YOU TO REJECT THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR EYES AND EARS IT WAS
THEIR FINAL MOST ESSENTIAL COMMAND HIS HEART SANK AS HE THOUGHT OF
THE ENORMOUS POWER ARRAYED AGAINST HIM THE EASE WITH WHICH ANY PARTY
INTELLECTUAL WOULD OVERTHROW HIM IN DEBATE THE SUBTLE ARGUMENTS WHICH HE
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND MUCH LESS ANSWER AND YET HE WAS IN THE
RIGHT THEY WERE WRONG AND HE WAS RIGHT THE OBVIOUS THE SILLY AND THE
TRUE HAD GOT TO BE DEFENDED TRUISMS ARE TRUE HOLD ON TO THAT THE SOLID
WORLD EXISTS ITS LAWS DO NOT CHANGE STONES ARE HARD WATER IS WET
OBJECTS UNSUPPORTED FALL TOWARDS THE EARTHS CENTRE WITH THE FEELING THAT
HE WAS SPEAKING TO OBRIEN AND ALSO THAT HE WAS SETTING FORTH AN IMPORTANT
AXIOM HE WROTE


FREEDOM IS THE FREEDOM TO SAY THAT TWO PLUS TWO MAKE FOUR IF THAT IS
GRANTED ALL ELSE FOLLOWS




CHAPTER 8



FROM SOMEWHERE AT THE BOTTOM OF A PASSAGE THE SMELL OF ROASTING
COFFEEREAL COFFEE NOT VICTORY COFFEECAME FLOATING OUT INTO THE STREET
WINSTON PAUSED INVOLUNTARILY FOR PERHAPS TWO SECONDS HE WAS BACK IN THE
HALFFORGOTTEN WORLD OF HIS CHILDHOOD THEN A DOOR BANGED SEEMING TO CUT
OFF THE SMELL AS ABRUPTLY AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A SOUND

HE HAD WALKED SEVERAL KILOMETRES OVER PAVEMENTS AND HIS VARICOSE ULCER
WAS THROBBING THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME IN THREE WEEKS THAT HE HAD MISSED
AN EVENING AT THE COMMUNITY CENTRE A RASH ACT SINCE YOU COULD BE CERTAIN
THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUR ATTENDANCES AT THE CENTRE WAS CAREFULLY CHECKED
IN PRINCIPLE A PARTY MEMBER HAD NO SPARE TIME AND WAS NEVER ALONE EXCEPT
IN BED IT WAS ASSUMED THAT WHEN HE WAS NOT WORKING EATING OR SLEEPING
HE WOULD BE TAKING PART IN SOME KIND OF COMMUNAL RECREATION TO DO ANYTHING
THAT SUGGESTED A TASTE FOR SOLITUDE EVEN TO GO FOR A WALK BY YOURSELF
WAS ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS THERE WAS A WORD FOR IT IN NEWSPEAK
OWNLIFE IT WAS CALLED MEANING INDIVIDUALISM AND ECCENTRICITY BUT THIS
EVENING AS HE CAME OUT OF THE MINISTRY THE BALMINESS OF THE APRIL AIR HAD
TEMPTED HIM THE SKY WAS A WARMER BLUE THAN HE HAD SEEN IT THAT YEAR AND
SUDDENLY THE LONG NOISY EVENING AT THE CENTRE THE BORING EXHAUSTING
GAMES THE LECTURES THE CREAKING CAMARADERIE OILED BY GIN HAD SEEMED
INTOLERABLE ON IMPULSE HE HAD TURNED AWAY FROM THE BUSSTOP AND WANDERED
OFF INTO THE LABYRINTH OF LONDON FIRST SOUTH THEN EAST THEN NORTH AGAIN
LOSING HIMSELF AMONG UNKNOWN STREETS AND HARDLY BOTHERING IN WHICH
DIRECTION HE WAS GOING

IF THERE IS HOPE HE HAD WRITTEN IN THE DIARY IT LIES IN THE PROLES
THE WORDS KEPT COMING BACK TO HIM STATEMENT OF A MYSTICAL TRUTH AND A
PALPABLE ABSURDITY HE WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE VAGUE BROWNCOLOURED SLUMS
TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SAINT PANCRAS STATION HE WAS
WALKING UP A COBBLED STREET OF LITTLE TWOSTOREY HOUSES WITH BATTERED
DOORWAYS WHICH GAVE STRAIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT AND WHICH WERE SOMEHOW
CURIOUSLY SUGGESTIVE OF RATHOLES THERE WERE PUDDLES OF FILTHY WATER HERE
AND THERE AMONG THE COBBLES IN AND OUT OF THE DARK DOORWAYS AND DOWN
NARROW ALLEYWAYS THAT BRANCHED OFF ON EITHER SIDE PEOPLE SWARMED IN
ASTONISHING NUMBERSGIRLS IN FULL BLOOM WITH CRUDELY LIPSTICKED MOUTHS
AND YOUTHS WHO CHASED THE GIRLS AND SWOLLEN WADDLING WOMEN WHO SHOWED YOU
WHAT THE GIRLS WOULD BE LIKE IN TEN YEARS TIME AND OLD BENT CREATURES
SHUFFLING ALONG ON SPLAYED FEET AND RAGGED BAREFOOTED CHILDREN WHO PLAYED
IN THE PUDDLES AND THEN SCATTERED AT ANGRY YELLS FROM THEIR MOTHERS
PERHAPS A QUARTER OF THE WINDOWS IN THE STREET WERE BROKEN AND BOARDED UP
MOST OF THE PEOPLE PAID NO ATTENTION TO WINSTON A FEW EYED HIM WITH A
SORT OF GUARDED CURIOSITY TWO MONSTROUS WOMEN WITH BRICKRED FOREARMS
FOLDED ACROSS THEIR APRONS WERE TALKING OUTSIDE A DOORWAY WINSTON CAUGHT
SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION AS HE APPROACHED

YES I SAYS TO ER THATS ALL VERY WELL I SAYS BUT IF YOUD OF
BEEN IN MY PLACE YOUD OF DONE THE SAME AS WHAT I DONE ITS EASY TO
CRITICIZE I SAYS BUT YOU AINT GOT THE SAME PROBLEMS AS WHAT I GOT

AH SAID THE OTHER THATS JEST IT THATS JEST WHERE IT IS

THE STRIDENT VOICES STOPPED ABRUPTLY THE WOMEN STUDIED HIM IN HOSTILE
SILENCE AS HE WENT PAST BUT IT WAS NOT HOSTILITY EXACTLY MERELY A KIND
OF WARINESS A MOMENTARY STIFFENING AS AT THE PASSING OF SOME UNFAMILIAR
ANIMAL THE BLUE OVERALLS OF THE PARTY COULD NOT BE A COMMON SIGHT IN A
STREET LIKE THIS INDEED IT WAS UNWISE TO BE SEEN IN SUCH PLACES UNLESS
YOU HAD DEFINITE BUSINESS THERE THE PATROLS MIGHT STOP YOU IF YOU HAPPENED
TO RUN INTO THEM MAY I SEE YOUR PAPERS COMRADE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE WORK IS THIS YOUR USUAL WAY HOMEAND SO ON AND
SO FORTH NOT THAT THERE WAS ANY RULE AGAINST WALKING HOME BY AN UNUSUAL
ROUTE BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOU IF THE THOUGHT POLICE
HEARD ABOUT IT

SUDDENLY THE WHOLE STREET WAS IN COMMOTION THERE WERE YELLS OF WARNING
FROM ALL SIDES PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING INTO THE DOORWAYS LIKE RABBITS A
YOUNG WOMAN LEAPT OUT OF A DOORWAY A LITTLE AHEAD OF WINSTON GRABBED UP A
TINY CHILD PLAYING IN A PUDDLE WHIPPED HER APRON ROUND IT AND LEAPT BACK
AGAIN ALL IN ONE MOVEMENT AT THE SAME INSTANT A MAN IN A CONCERTINALIKE
BLACK SUIT WHO HAD EMERGED FROM A SIDE ALLEY RAN TOWARDS WINSTON
POINTING EXCITEDLY TO THE SKY

STEAMER HE YELLED LOOK OUT GUVNOR BANG OVEREAD LAY DOWN QUICK

STEAMER WAS A NICKNAME WHICH FOR SOME REASON THE PROLES APPLIED TO
ROCKET BOMBS WINSTON PROMPTLY FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS FACE THE PROLES WERE
NEARLY ALWAYS RIGHT WHEN THEY GAVE YOU A WARNING OF THIS KIND THEY SEEMED
TO POSSESS SOME KIND OF INSTINCT WHICH TOLD THEM SEVERAL SECONDS IN ADVANCE
WHEN A ROCKET WAS COMING ALTHOUGH THE ROCKETS SUPPOSEDLY TRAVELLED FASTER
THAN SOUND WINSTON CLASPED HIS FOREARMS ABOVE HIS HEAD THERE WAS A ROAR
THAT SEEMED TO MAKE THE PAVEMENT HEAVE A SHOWER OF LIGHT OBJECTS PATTERED
ON TO HIS BACK WHEN HE STOOD UP HE FOUND THAT HE WAS COVERED WITH
FRAGMENTS OF GLASS FROM THE NEAREST WINDOW

HE WALKED ON THE BOMB HAD DEMOLISHED A GROUP OF HOUSES 200 METRES UP THE
STREET A BLACK PLUME OF SMOKE HUNG IN THE SKY AND BELOW IT A CLOUD OF
PLASTER DUST IN WHICH A CROWD WAS ALREADY FORMING AROUND THE RUINS THERE
WAS A LITTLE PILE OF PLASTER LYING ON THE PAVEMENT AHEAD OF HIM AND IN
THE MIDDLE OF IT HE COULD SEE A BRIGHT RED STREAK WHEN HE GOT UP TO IT HE
SAW THAT IT WAS A HUMAN HAND SEVERED AT THE WRIST APART FROM THE BLOODY
STUMP THE HAND WAS SO COMPLETELY WHITENED AS TO RESEMBLE A PLASTER CAST

HE KICKED THE THING INTO THE GUTTER AND THEN TO AVOID THE CROWD TURNED
DOWN A SIDESTREET TO THE RIGHT WITHIN THREE OR FOUR MINUTES HE WAS OUT
OF THE AREA WHICH THE BOMB HAD AFFECTED AND THE SORDID SWARMING LIFE OF
THE STREETS WAS GOING ON AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED IT WAS NEARLY
TWENTY HOURS AND THE DRINKINGSHOPS WHICH THE PROLES FREQUENTED PUBS
THEY CALLED THEM WERE CHOKED WITH CUSTOMERS FROM THEIR GRIMY SWING DOORS
ENDLESSLY OPENING AND SHUTTING THERE CAME FORTH A SMELL OF URINE SAWDUST
AND SOUR BEER IN AN ANGLE FORMED BY A PROJECTING HOUSEFRONT THREE MEN
WERE STANDING VERY CLOSE TOGETHER THE MIDDLE ONE OF THEM HOLDING A
FOLDEDUP NEWSPAPER WHICH THE OTHER TWO WERE STUDYING OVER HIS SHOULDER
EVEN BEFORE HE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO MAKE OUT THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES
WINSTON COULD SEE ABSORPTION IN EVERY LINE OF THEIR BODIES IT WAS
OBVIOUSLY SOME SERIOUS PIECE OF NEWS THAT THEY WERE READING HE WAS A FEW
PACES AWAY FROM THEM WHEN SUDDENLY THE GROUP BROKE UP AND TWO OF THE MEN
WERE IN VIOLENT ALTERCATION FOR A MOMENT THEY SEEMED ALMOST ON THE POINT
OF BLOWS

CANT YOU BLEEDING WELL LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY I TELL YOU NO NUMBER ENDING
IN SEVEN AINT WON FOR OVER FOURTEEN MONTHS

YES IT AS THEN

NO IT AS NOT BACK OME I GOT THE OLE LOT OF EM FOR OVER TWO YEARS
WROTE DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER I TAKES EM DOWN REGLAR AS THE CLOCK AN
I TELL YOU NO NUMBER ENDING IN SEVEN

YES A SEVEN AS WON I COULD PRETTY NEAR TELL YOU THE BLEEDING NUMBER
FOUR OH SEVEN IT ENDED IN IT WERE IN FEBRUARYSECOND WEEK IN FEBRUARY

FEBRUARY YOUR GRANDMOTHER I GOT IT ALL DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE AN I
TELL YOU NO NUMBER

OH PACK IT IN SAID THE THIRD MAN

THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LOTTERY WINSTON LOOKED BACK WHEN HE HAD GONE
THIRTY METRES THEY WERE STILL ARGUING WITH VIVID PASSIONATE FACES
THE LOTTERY WITH ITS WEEKLY PAYOUT OF ENORMOUS PRIZES WAS THE ONE PUBLIC
EVENT TO WHICH THE PROLES PAID SERIOUS ATTENTION IT WAS PROBABLE THAT
THERE WERE SOME MILLIONS OF PROLES FOR WHOM THE LOTTERY WAS THE PRINCIPAL
IF NOT THE ONLY REASON FOR REMAINING ALIVE IT WAS THEIR DELIGHT THEIR
FOLLY THEIR ANODYNE THEIR INTELLECTUAL STIMULANT WHERE THE LOTTERY WAS
CONCERNED EVEN PEOPLE WHO COULD BARELY READ AND WRITE SEEMED CAPABLE OF
INTRICATE CALCULATIONS AND STAGGERING FEATS OF MEMORY THERE WAS A WHOLE
TRIBE OF MEN WHO MADE A LIVING SIMPLY BY SELLING SYSTEMS FORECASTS AND
LUCKY AMULETS WINSTON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RUNNING OF THE LOTTERY
WHICH WAS MANAGED BY THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY BUT HE WAS AWARE INDEED
EVERYONE IN THE PARTY WAS AWARE THAT THE PRIZES WERE LARGELY IMAGINARY
ONLY SMALL SUMS WERE ACTUALLY PAID OUT THE WINNERS OF THE BIG PRIZES BEING
NONEXISTENT PERSONS IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN
ONE PART OF OCEANIA AND ANOTHER THIS WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE

BUT IF THERE WAS HOPE IT LAY IN THE PROLES YOU HAD TO CLING ON TO THAT
WHEN YOU PUT IT IN WORDS IT SOUNDED REASONABLE IT WAS WHEN YOU LOOKED AT
THE HUMAN BEINGS PASSING YOU ON THE PAVEMENT THAT IT BECAME AN ACT OF
FAITH THE STREET INTO WHICH HE HAD TURNED RAN DOWNHILL HE HAD A FEELING
THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD BEFORE AND THAT THERE WAS A MAIN
THOROUGHFARE NOT FAR AWAY FROM SOMEWHERE AHEAD THERE CAME A DIN OF
SHOUTING VOICES THE STREET TOOK A SHARP TURN AND THEN ENDED IN A FLIGHT
OF STEPS WHICH LED DOWN INTO A SUNKEN ALLEY WHERE A FEW STALLKEEPERS
WERE SELLING TIREDLOOKING VEGETABLES AT THIS MOMENT WINSTON REMEMBERED
WHERE HE WAS THE ALLEY LED OUT INTO THE MAIN STREET AND DOWN THE NEXT
TURNING NOT FIVE MINUTES AWAY WAS THE JUNKSHOP WHERE HE HAD BOUGHT THE
BLANK BOOK WHICH WAS NOW HIS DIARY AND IN A SMALL STATIONERS SHOP NOT
FAR AWAY HE HAD BOUGHT HIS PENHOLDER AND HIS BOTTLE OF INK

HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF
THE ALLEY THERE WAS A DINGY LITTLE PUB WHOSE WINDOWS APPEARED TO BE FROSTED
OVER BUT IN REALITY WERE MERELY COATED WITH DUST A VERY OLD MAN BENT BUT
ACTIVE WITH WHITE MOUSTACHES THAT BRISTLED FORWARD LIKE THOSE OF A PRAWN
PUSHED OPEN THE SWING DOOR AND WENT IN AS WINSTON STOOD WATCHING IT
OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE OLD MAN WHO MUST BE EIGHTY AT THE LEAST HAD
ALREADY BEEN MIDDLEAGED WHEN THE REVOLUTION HAPPENED HE AND A FEW OTHERS
LIKE HIM WERE THE LAST LINKS THAT NOW EXISTED WITH THE VANISHED WORLD OF
CAPITALISM IN THE PARTY ITSELF THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE LEFT WHOSE IDEAS
HAD BEEN FORMED BEFORE THE REVOLUTION THE OLDER GENERATION HAD MOSTLY
BEEN WIPED OUT IN THE GREAT PURGES OF THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND THE FEW
WHO SURVIVED HAD LONG AGO BEEN TERRIFIED INTO COMPLETE INTELLECTUAL
SURRENDER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE STILL ALIVE WHO COULD GIVE YOU A TRUTHFUL
ACCOUNT OF CONDITIONS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE CENTURY IT COULD ONLY BE A
PROLE SUDDENLY THE PASSAGE FROM THE HISTORY BOOK THAT HE HAD COPIED INTO
HIS DIARY CAME BACK INTO WINSTONS MIND AND A LUNATIC IMPULSE TOOK HOLD
OF HIM HE WOULD GO INTO THE PUB HE WOULD SCRAPE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THAT
OLD MAN AND QUESTION HIM HE WOULD SAY TO HIM TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LIFE
WHEN YOU WERE A BOY WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN THOSE DAYS WERE THINGS BETTER
THAN THEY ARE NOW OR WERE THEY WORSE

HURRIEDLY LEST HE SHOULD HAVE TIME TO BECOME FRIGHTENED HE DESCENDED THE
STEPS AND CROSSED THE NARROW STREET IT WAS MADNESS OF COURSE AS USUAL
THERE WAS NO DEFINITE RULE AGAINST TALKING TO PROLES AND FREQUENTING THEIR
PUBS BUT IT WAS FAR TOO UNUSUAL AN ACTION TO PASS UNNOTICED IF THE
PATROLS APPEARED HE MIGHT PLEAD AN ATTACK OF FAINTNESS BUT IT WAS NOT
LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD BELIEVE HIM HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND A HIDEOUS
CHEESY SMELL OF SOUR BEER HIT HIM IN THE FACE AS HE ENTERED THE DIN OF
VOICES DROPPED TO ABOUT HALF ITS VOLUME BEHIND HIS BACK HE COULD FEEL
EVERYONE EYEING HIS BLUE OVERALLS A GAME OF DARTS WHICH WAS GOING ON AT
THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM INTERRUPTED ITSELF FOR PERHAPS AS MUCH AS THIRTY
SECONDS THE OLD MAN WHOM HE HAD FOLLOWED WAS STANDING AT THE BAR HAVING
SOME KIND OF ALTERCATION WITH THE BARMAN A LARGE STOUT HOOKNOSED YOUNG
MAN WITH ENORMOUS FOREARMS A KNOT OF OTHERS STANDING ROUND WITH GLASSES
IN THEIR HANDS WERE WATCHING THE SCENE

I ARST YOU CIVIL ENOUGH DIDNT I SAID THE OLD MAN STRAIGHTENING HIS
SHOULDERS PUGNACIOUSLY YOU TELLING ME YOU AINT GOT A PINT MUG IN THE
OLE BLEEDING BOOZER

AND WHAT IN HELLS NAME IS A PINT SAID THE BARMAN LEANING FORWARD WITH
THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS ON THE COUNTER

ARK AT IM CALLS ISSELF A BARMAN AND DONT KNOW WHAT A PINT IS WHY
A PINTS THE ALF OF A QUART AND THERES FOUR QUARTS TO THE GALLON
AVE TO TEACH YOU THE A B C NEXT

LITRETHATS ALL WE SERVE THERES THE GLASSES ON THE SHELF IN FRONT
OF YOU

I LIKES A PINT PERSISTED THE OLD MAN YOU COULD A DRAWED ME OFF A PINT
EASY ENOUGH WE DIDNT AVE THESE BLEEDING LITRES WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN

WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN WE WERE ALL LIVING IN THE TREETOPS SAID THE
BARMAN WITH A GLANCE AT THE OTHER CUSTOMERS

THERE WAS A SHOUT OF LAUGHTER AND THE UNEASINESS CAUSED BY WINSTONS ENTRY
SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR THE OLD MANS WHITESTUBBLED FACE HAD FLUSHED PINK HE
TURNED AWAY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND BUMPED INTO WINSTON WINSTON CAUGHT
HIM GENTLY BY THE ARM

MAY I OFFER YOU A DRINK HE SAID

YOURE A GENT SAID THE OTHER STRAIGHTENING HIS SHOULDERS AGAIN HE
APPEARED NOT TO HAVE NOTICED WINSTONS BLUE OVERALLS PINT HE ADDED
AGGRESSIVELY TO THE BARMAN PINT OF WALLOP

THE BARMAN SWISHED TWO HALFLITRES OF DARKBROWN BEER INTO THICK GLASSES
WHICH HE HAD RINSED IN A BUCKET UNDER THE COUNTER BEER WAS THE ONLY DRINK
YOU COULD GET IN PROLE PUBS THE PROLES WERE SUPPOSED NOT TO DRINK GIN
THOUGH IN PRACTICE THEY COULD GET HOLD OF IT EASILY ENOUGH THE GAME OF
DARTS WAS IN FULL SWING AGAIN AND THE KNOT OF MEN AT THE BAR HAD BEGUN
TALKING ABOUT LOTTERY TICKETS WINSTONS PRESENCE WAS FORGOTTEN FOR A
MOMENT THERE WAS A DEAL TABLE UNDER THE WINDOW WHERE HE AND THE OLD MAN
COULD TALK WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING OVERHEARD IT WAS HORRIBLY DANGEROUS BUT
AT ANY RATE THERE WAS NO TELESCREEN IN THE ROOM A POINT HE HAD MADE SURE
OF AS SOON AS HE CAME IN

E COULD A DRAWED ME OFF A PINT GRUMBLED THE OLD MAN AS HE SETTLED DOWN
BEHIND A GLASS A ALF LITRE AINT ENOUGH IT DONT SATISFY AND A OLE
LITRES TOO MUCH IT STARTS MY BLADDER RUNNING LET ALONE THE PRICE

YOU MUST HAVE SEEN GREAT CHANGES SINCE YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN SAID
WINSTON TENTATIVELY

THE OLD MANS PALE BLUE EYES MOVED FROM THE DARTS BOARD TO THE BAR AND
FROM THE BAR TO THE DOOR OF THE GENTS AS THOUGH IT WERE IN THE BARROOM
THAT HE EXPECTED THE CHANGES TO HAVE OCCURRED

THE BEER WAS BETTER HE SAID FINALLY AND CHEAPER WHEN I WAS A YOUNG
MAN MILD BEERWALLOP WE USED TO CALL ITWAS FOURPENCE A PINT THAT WAS
BEFORE THE WAR OF COURSE

WHICH WAR WAS THAT SAID WINSTON

ITS ALL WARS SAID THE OLD MAN VAGUELY HE TOOK UP HIS GLASS AND HIS
SHOULDERS STRAIGHTENED AGAIN ERES WISHING YOU THE VERY BEST OF EALTH

IN HIS LEAN THROAT THE SHARPPOINTED ADAMS APPLE MADE A SURPRISINGLY RAPID
UPANDDOWN MOVEMENT AND THE BEER VANISHED WINSTON WENT TO THE BAR AND
CAME BACK WITH TWO MORE HALFLITRES THE OLD MAN APPEARED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST DRINKING A FULL LITRE

YOU ARE VERY MUCH OLDER THAN I AM SAID WINSTON YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A
GROWN MAN BEFORE I WAS BORN YOU CAN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE OLD
DAYS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION PEOPLE OF MY AGE DONT REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THOSE TIMES WE CAN ONLY READ ABOUT THEM IN BOOKS AND WHAT IT SAYS
IN THE BOOKS MAY NOT BE TRUE I SHOULD LIKE YOUR OPINION ON THAT THE
HISTORY BOOKS SAY THAT LIFE BEFORE THE REVOLUTION WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT IT IS NOW THERE WAS THE MOST TERRIBLE OPPRESSION INJUSTICE
POVERTY WORSE THAN ANYTHING WE CAN IMAGINE HERE IN LONDON THE GREAT MASS
OF THE PEOPLE NEVER HAD ENOUGH TO EAT FROM BIRTH TO DEATH HALF OF THEM
HADNT EVEN BOOTS ON THEIR FEET THEY WORKED TWELVE HOURS A DAY THEY LEFT
SCHOOL AT NINE THEY SLEPT TEN IN A ROOM AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE
A VERY FEW PEOPLE ONLY A FEW THOUSANDSTHE CAPITALISTS THEY WERE
CALLEDWHO WERE RICH AND POWERFUL THEY OWNED EVERYTHING THAT THERE WAS
TO OWN THEY LIVED IN GREAT GORGEOUS HOUSES WITH THIRTY SERVANTS THEY
RODE ABOUT IN MOTORCARS AND FOURHORSE CARRIAGES THEY DRANK CHAMPAGNE
THEY WORE TOP HATS

THE OLD MAN BRIGHTENED SUDDENLY

TOP ATS HE SAID FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION EM THE SAME THING COME
INTO MY EAD ONLY YESTERDAY I DONO WHY I WAS JEST THINKING I AINT SEEN
A TOP AT IN YEARS GORN RIGHT OUT THEY AVE THE LAST TIME I WORE ONE
WAS AT MY SISTERINLAWS FUNERAL AND THAT WASWELL I COULDNT GIVE YOU
THE DATE BUT IT MUSTA BEEN FIFTY YEARS AGO OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY IRED
FOR THE OCCASION YOU UNDERSTAND

IT ISNT VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THE TOP HATS SAID WINSTON PATIENTLY
THE POINT IS THESE CAPITALISTSTHEY AND A FEW LAWYERS AND PRIESTS AND
SO FORTH WHO LIVED ON THEMWERE THE LORDS OF THE EARTH EVERYTHING EXISTED
FOR THEIR BENEFIT YOUTHE ORDINARY PEOPLE THE WORKERSWERE THEIR
SLAVES THEY COULD DO WHAT THEY LIKED WITH YOU THEY COULD SHIP YOU OFF TO
CANADA LIKE CATTLE THEY COULD SLEEP WITH YOUR DAUGHTERS IF THEY CHOSE
THEY COULD ORDER YOU TO BE FLOGGED WITH SOMETHING CALLED A CATONINE
TAILS YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR CAP OFF WHEN YOU PASSED THEM EVERY CAPITALIST
WENT ABOUT WITH A GANG OF LACKEYS WHO

THE OLD MAN BRIGHTENED AGAIN

LACKEYS HE SAID NOW THERES A WORD I AINT EARD SINCE EVER SO LONG
LACKEYS THAT REGLAR TAKES ME BACK THAT DOES I RECOLLECTOH DONKEYS
YEARS AGOI USED TO SOMETIMES GO TO YDE PARK OF A SUNDAY AFTERNOON TO

THE RULING CLASS PARASITESTHAT WAS ANOTHER OF THEM AND YENASE
DEFINITELY CALLED EM YENAS OF COURSE E WAS REFERRING TO THE LABOUR
PARTY YOU UNDERSTAND

WINSTON HAD THE FEELING THAT THEY WERE TALKING AT CROSSPURPOSES

WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WAS THIS HE SAID DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU
HAVE MORE FREEDOM NOW THAN YOU HAD IN THOSE DAYS ARE YOU TREATED MORE
LIKE A HUMAN BEING IN THE OLD DAYS THE RICH PEOPLE THE PEOPLE AT THE
TOP

THE OUSE OF LORDS PUT IN THE OLD MAN REMINISCENTLY

THE HOUSE OF LORDS IF YOU LIKE WHAT I AM ASKING IS WERE THESE PEOPLE
ABLE TO TREAT YOU AS AN INFERIOR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE RICH AND YOU
WERE POOR IS IT A FACT FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU HAD TO CALL THEM SIR AND
TAKE OFF YOUR CAP WHEN YOU PASSED THEM

THE OLD MAN APPEARED TO THINK DEEPLY HE DRANK OFF ABOUT A QUARTER OF HIS
BEER BEFORE ANSWERING

YES HE SAID THEY LIKED YOU TO TOUCH YOUR CAP TO EM IT SHOWED
RESPECT LIKE I DIDNT AGREE WITH IT MYSELF BUT I DONE IT OFTEN ENOUGH
HAD TO AS YOU MIGHT SAY

AND WAS IT USUALIM ONLY QUOTING WHAT IVE READ IN HISTORY BOOKSWAS
IT USUAL FOR THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR SERVANTS TO PUSH YOU OFF THE PAVEMENT
INTO THE GUTTER

ONE OF EM PUSHED ME ONCE SAID THE OLD MAN I RECOLLECT IT AS IF IT
WAS YESTERDAY IT WAS BOAT RACE NIGHTTERRIBLY ROWDY THEY USED TO GET ON
BOAT RACE NIGHTAND I BUMPS INTO A YOUNG BLOKE ON SHAFTESBURY AVENUE

WHEELS OF A BUS WELL I WAS YOUNG IN THEM DAYS AND I WAS GOING TO AVE
FETCHED IM ONE ONLY

A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS TOOK HOLD OF WINSTON THE OLD MANS MEMORY WAS
NOTHING BUT A RUBBISHHEAP OF DETAILS ONE COULD QUESTION HIM ALL DAY
WITHOUT GETTING ANY REAL INFORMATION THE PARTY HISTORIES MIGHT STILL BE
TRUE AFTER A FASHION THEY MIGHT EVEN BE COMPLETELY TRUE HE MADE A LAST
ATTEMPT

PERHAPS I HAVE NOT MADE MYSELF CLEAR HE SAID WHAT IM TRYING TO SAY
IS THIS YOU HAVE BEEN ALIVE A VERY LONG TIME YOU LIVED HALF YOUR LIFE
BEFORE THE REVOLUTION IN 1925 FOR INSTANCE YOU WERE ALREADY GROWN UP
WOULD YOU SAY FROM WHAT YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT LIFE IN 1925 WAS BETTER
THAN IT IS NOW OR WORSE IF YOU COULD CHOOSE WOULD YOU PREFER TO LIVE
THEN OR NOW

THE OLD MAN LOOKED MEDITATIVELY AT THE DARTS BOARD HE FINISHED UP HIS
BEER MORE SLOWLY THAN BEFORE WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A TOLERANT
PHILOSOPHICAL AIR AS THOUGH THE BEER HAD MELLOWED HIM

I KNOW WHAT YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY HE SAID YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY AS ID
SOONER BE YOUNG AGAIN MOST PEOPLED SAY THEYD SOONER BE YOUNG IF YOU
ARST EM YOU GOT YOUR EALTH AND STRENGTH WHEN YOURE YOUNG WHEN YOU
GET TO MY TIME OF LIFE YOU AINT NEVER WELL I SUFFER SOMETHING WICKED
FROM MY FEET AND MY BLADDERS JEST TERRIBLE SIX AND SEVEN TIMES A NIGHT
IT AS ME OUT OF BED ON THE OTHER AND THERES GREAT ADVANTAGES IN BEING
A OLD MAN YOU AINT GOT THE SAME WORRIES NO TRUCK WITH WOMEN AND THATS
A GREAT THING I AINT AD A WOMAN FOR NEAR ON THIRTY YEAR IF YOUD
CREDIT IT NOR WANTED TO WHATS MORE

WINSTON SAT BACK AGAINST THE WINDOWSILL IT WAS NO USE GOING ON HE WAS
ABOUT TO BUY SOME MORE BEER WHEN THE OLD MAN SUDDENLY GOT UP AND SHUFFLED
RAPIDLY INTO THE STINKING URINAL AT THE SIDE OF THE ROOM THE EXTRA
HALFLITRE WAS ALREADY WORKING ON HIM WINSTON SAT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
GAZING AT HIS EMPTY GLASS AND HARDLY NOTICED WHEN HIS FEET CARRIED HIM OUT
INTO THE STREET AGAIN WITHIN TWENTY YEARS AT THE MOST HE REFLECTED THE
HUGE AND SIMPLE QUESTION WAS LIFE BETTER BEFORE THE REVOLUTION THAN IT
IS NOW WOULD HAVE CEASED ONCE AND FOR ALL TO BE ANSWERABLE BUT IN EFFECT
IT WAS UNANSWERABLE EVEN NOW SINCE THE FEW SCATTERED SURVIVORS FROM THE
ANCIENT WORLD WERE INCAPABLE OF COMPARING ONE AGE WITH ANOTHER THEY
REMEMBERED A MILLION USELESS THINGS A QUARREL WITH A WORKMATE A HUNT FOR
A LOST BICYCLE PUMP THE EXPRESSION ON A LONGDEAD SISTERS FACE THE
SWIRLS OF DUST ON A WINDY MORNING SEVENTY YEARS AGO BUT ALL THE RELEVANT
FACTS WERE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THEIR VISION THEY WERE LIKE THE ANT
WHICH CAN SEE SMALL OBJECTS BUT NOT LARGE ONES AND WHEN MEMORY FAILED AND
WRITTEN RECORDS WERE FALSIFIEDWHEN THAT HAPPENED THE CLAIM OF THE PARTY
TO HAVE IMPROVED THE CONDITIONS OF HUMAN LIFE HAD GOT TO BE ACCEPTED
BECAUSE THERE DID NOT EXIST AND NEVER AGAIN COULD EXIST ANY STANDARD
AGAINST WHICH IT COULD BE TESTED

AT THIS MOMENT HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT STOPPED ABRUPTLY HE HALTED AND LOOKED
UP HE WAS IN A NARROW STREET WITH A FEW DARK LITTLE SHOPS INTERSPERSED
AMONG DWELLINGHOUSES IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIS HEAD THERE HUNG THREE
DISCOLOURED METAL BALLS WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD ONCE BEEN GILDED HE
SEEMED TO KNOW THE PLACE OF COURSE HE WAS STANDING OUTSIDE THE JUNKSHOP
WHERE HE HAD BOUGHT THE DIARY

A TWINGE OF FEAR WENT THROUGH HIM IT HAD BEEN A SUFFICIENTLY RASH ACT TO
BUY THE BOOK IN THE BEGINNING AND HE HAD SWORN NEVER TO COME NEAR THE
PLACE AGAIN AND YET THE INSTANT THAT HE ALLOWED HIS THOUGHTS TO WANDER
HIS FEET HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK HERE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD IT WAS PRECISELY
AGAINST SUICIDAL IMPULSES OF THIS KIND THAT HE HAD HOPED TO GUARD HIMSELF
BY OPENING THE DIARY AT THE SAME TIME HE NOTICED THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS
NEARLY TWENTYONE HOURS THE SHOP WAS STILL OPEN WITH THE FEELING THAT HE
WOULD BE LESS CONSPICUOUS INSIDE THAN HANGING ABOUT ON THE PAVEMENT HE
STEPPED THROUGH THE DOORWAY IF QUESTIONED HE COULD PLAUSIBLY SAY THAT
HE WAS TRYING TO BUY RAZOR BLADES

THE PROPRIETOR HAD JUST LIGHTED A HANGING OIL LAMP WHICH GAVE OFF AN
UNCLEAN BUT FRIENDLY SMELL HE WAS A MAN OF PERHAPS SIXTY FRAIL AND
BOWED WITH A LONG BENEVOLENT NOSE AND MILD EYES DISTORTED BY THICK
SPECTACLES HIS HAIR WAS ALMOST WHITE BUT HIS EYEBROWS WERE BUSHY AND
STILL BLACK HIS SPECTACLES HIS GENTLE FUSSY MOVEMENTS AND THE FACT
THAT HE WAS WEARING AN AGED JACKET OF BLACK VELVET GAVE HIM A VAGUE AIR
OF INTELLECTUALITY AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF LITERARY MAN OR
PERHAPS A MUSICIAN HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AS THOUGH FADED AND HIS ACCENT
LESS DEBASED THAN THAT OF THE MAJORITY OF PROLES

I RECOGNIZED YOU ON THE PAVEMENT HE SAID IMMEDIATELY YOURE THE
GENTLEMAN THAT BOUGHT THE YOUNG LADYS KEEPSAKE ALBUM THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
BIT OF PAPER THAT WAS CREAMLAID IT USED TO BE CALLED THERES BEEN NO
PAPER LIKE THAT MADE FOROH I DARE SAY FIFTY YEARS HE PEERED AT WINSTON
OVER THE TOP OF HIS SPECTACLES IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL I CAN DO FOR
YOU OR DID YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK ROUND

I WAS PASSING SAID WINSTON VAGUELY I JUST LOOKED IN I DONT WANT
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR

ITS JUST AS WELL SAID THE OTHER BECAUSE I DONT SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE
SATISFIED YOU HE MADE AN APOLOGETIC GESTURE WITH HIS SOFTPALMED HAND
YOU SEE HOW IT IS AN EMPTY SHOP YOU MIGHT SAY BETWEEN YOU AND ME THE
ANTIQUE TRADES JUST ABOUT FINISHED NO DEMAND ANY LONGER AND NO STOCK
EITHER FURNITURE CHINA GLASS ITS ALL BEEN BROKEN UP BY DEGREES AND
OF COURSE THE METAL STUFFS MOSTLY BEEN MELTED DOWN I HAVENT SEEN A BRASS
CANDLESTICK IN YEARS

THE TINY INTERIOR OF THE SHOP WAS IN FACT UNCOMFORTABLY FULL BUT THERE
WAS ALMOST NOTHING IN IT OF THE SLIGHTEST VALUE THE FLOORSPACE WAS VERY
RESTRICTED BECAUSE ALL ROUND THE WALLS WERE STACKED INNUMERABLE DUSTY
PICTUREFRAMES IN THE WINDOW THERE WERE TRAYS OF NUTS AND BOLTS WORNOUT
CHISELS PENKNIVES WITH BROKEN BLADES TARNISHED WATCHES THAT DID NOT EVEN
PRETEND TO BE IN GOING ORDER AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS RUBBISH ONLY ON A
SMALL TABLE IN THE CORNER WAS THERE A LITTER OF ODDS AND ENDSLACQUERED
SNUFFBOXES AGATE BROOCHES AND THE LIKEWHICH LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY MIGHT
INCLUDE SOMETHING INTERESTING AS WINSTON WANDERED TOWARDS THE TABLE HIS
EYE WAS CAUGHT BY A ROUND SMOOTH THING THAT GLEAMED SOFTLY IN THE
LAMPLIGHT AND HE PICKED IT UP

IT WAS A HEAVY LUMP OF GLASS CURVED ON ONE SIDE FLAT ON THE OTHER MAKING
ALMOST A HEMISPHERE THERE WAS A PECULIAR SOFTNESS AS OF RAINWATER IN
BOTH THE COLOUR AND THE TEXTURE OF THE GLASS AT THE HEART OF IT MAGNIFIED
BY THE CURVED SURFACE THERE WAS A STRANGE PINK CONVOLUTED OBJECT THAT
RECALLED A ROSE OR A SEA ANEMONE

WHAT IS IT SAID WINSTON FASCINATED

THATS CORAL THAT IS SAID THE OLD MAN IT MUST HAVE COME FROM THE
INDIAN OCEAN THEY USED TO KIND OF EMBED IT IN THE GLASS THAT WASNT MADE
LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO MORE BY THE LOOK OF IT

ITS A BEAUTIFUL THING SAID WINSTON

IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING SAID THE OTHER APPRECIATIVELY BUT THERES NOT
MANY THATD SAY SO NOWADAYS HE COUGHED NOW IF IT SO HAPPENED THAT YOU
WANTED TO BUY IT THATD COST YOU FOUR DOLLARS I CAN REMEMBER WHEN A THING
LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE FETCHED EIGHT POUNDS AND EIGHT POUNDS WASWELL I
CANT WORK IT OUT BUT IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY BUT WHO CARES ABOUT GENUINE
ANTIQUES NOWADAYSEVEN THE FEW THATS LEFT

WINSTON IMMEDIATELY PAID OVER THE FOUR DOLLARS AND SLID THE COVETED THING
INTO HIS POCKET WHAT APPEALED TO HIM ABOUT IT WAS NOT SO MUCH ITS BEAUTY
AS THE AIR IT SEEMED TO POSSESS OF BELONGING TO AN AGE QUITE DIFFERENT
FROM THE PRESENT ONE THE SOFT RAINWATERY GLASS WAS NOT LIKE ANY GLASS
THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN THE THING WAS DOUBLY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF ITS
APPARENT USELESSNESS THOUGH HE COULD GUESS THAT IT MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN
INTENDED AS A PAPERWEIGHT IT WAS VERY HEAVY IN HIS POCKET BUT FORTUNATELY
IT DID NOT MAKE MUCH OF A BULGE IT WAS A QUEER THING EVEN A COMPROMISING
THING FOR A PARTY MEMBER TO HAVE IN HIS POSSESSION ANYTHING OLD AND FOR
THAT MATTER ANYTHING BEAUTIFUL WAS ALWAYS VAGUELY SUSPECT THE OLD MAN HAD
GROWN NOTICEABLY MORE CHEERFUL AFTER RECEIVING THE FOUR DOLLARS WINSTON
REALIZED THAT HE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THREE OR EVEN TWO

THERES ANOTHER ROOM UPSTAIRS THAT YOU MIGHT CARE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HE
SAID THERES NOT MUCH IN IT JUST A FEW PIECES WELL DO WITH A LIGHT IF
WERE GOING UPSTAIRS

HE LIT ANOTHER LAMP AND WITH BOWED BACK LED THE WAY SLOWLY UP THE
STEEP AND WORN STAIRS AND ALONG A TINY PASSAGE INTO A ROOM WHICH DID
NOT GIVE ON THE STREET BUT LOOKED OUT ON A COBBLED YARD AND A FOREST OF
CHIMNEYPOTS WINSTON NOTICED THAT THE FURNITURE WAS STILL ARRANGED AS
THOUGH THE ROOM WERE MEANT TO BE LIVED IN THERE WAS A STRIP OF CARPET ON
THE FLOOR A PICTURE OR TWO ON THE WALLS AND A DEEP SLATTERNLY ARMCHAIR
DRAWN UP TO THE FIREPLACE AN OLDFASHIONED GLASS CLOCK WITH A TWELVEHOUR
FACE WAS TICKING AWAY ON THE MANTELPIECE UNDER THE WINDOW AND OCCUPYING
NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE ROOM WAS AN ENORMOUS BED WITH THE MATTRESS STILL
ON IT

WE LIVED HERE TILL MY WIFE DIED SAID THE OLD MAN HALF APOLOGETICALLY
IM SELLING THE FURNITURE OFF BY LITTLE AND LITTLE NOW THATS A BEAUTIFUL
MAHOGANY BED OR AT LEAST IT WOULD BE IF YOU COULD GET THE BUGS OUT OF IT
BUT I DARE SAY YOUD FIND IT A LITTLE BIT CUMBERSOME

HE WAS HOLDING THE LAMP HIGH UP SO AS TO ILLUMINATE THE WHOLE ROOM AND
IN THE WARM DIM LIGHT THE PLACE LOOKED CURIOUSLY INVITING THE THOUGHT
FLITTED THROUGH WINSTONS MIND THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE EASY TO
RENT THE ROOM FOR A FEW DOLLARS A WEEK IF HE DARED TO TAKE THE RISK IT
WAS A WILD IMPOSSIBLE NOTION TO BE ABANDONED AS SOON AS THOUGHT OF BUT
THE ROOM HAD AWAKENED IN HIM A SORT OF NOSTALGIA A SORT OF ANCESTRAL
MEMORY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO SIT IN
A ROOM LIKE THIS IN AN ARMCHAIR BESIDE AN OPEN FIRE WITH YOUR FEET IN
THE FENDER AND A KETTLE ON THE HOB UTTERLY ALONE UTTERLY SECURE WITH
NOBODY WATCHING YOU NO VOICE PURSUING YOU NO SOUND EXCEPT THE SINGING
OF THE KETTLE AND THE FRIENDLY TICKING OF THE CLOCK

THERES NO TELESCREEN HE COULD NOT HELP MURMURING

AH SAID THE OLD MAN I NEVER HAD ONE OF THOSE THINGS TOO EXPENSIVE
AND I NEVER SEEMED TO FEEL THE NEED OF IT SOMEHOW NOW THATS A NICE
GATELEG TABLE IN THE CORNER THERE THOUGH OF COURSE YOUD HAVE TO PUT NEW
HINGES ON IT IF YOU WANTED TO USE THE FLAPS

THERE WAS A SMALL BOOKCASE IN THE OTHER CORNER AND WINSTON HAD ALREADY
GRAVITATED TOWARDS IT IT CONTAINED NOTHING BUT RUBBISH THE HUNTINGDOWN
AND DESTRUCTION OF BOOKS HAD BEEN DONE WITH THE SAME THOROUGHNESS IN THE
PROLE QUARTERS AS EVERYWHERE ELSE IT WAS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THERE EXISTED
ANYWHERE IN OCEANIA A COPY OF A BOOK PRINTED EARLIER THAN 1960 THE OLD
MAN STILL CARRYING THE LAMP WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF A PICTURE IN A
ROSEWOOD FRAME WHICH HUNG ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE OPPOSITE
THE BED

NOW IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE INTERESTED IN OLD PRINTS AT ALL HE BEGAN
DELICATELY

WINSTON CAME ACROSS TO EXAMINE THE PICTURE IT WAS A STEEL ENGRAVING OF AN
OVAL BUILDING WITH RECTANGULAR WINDOWS AND A SMALL TOWER IN FRONT THERE
WAS A RAILING RUNNING ROUND THE BUILDING AND AT THE REAR END THERE WAS
WHAT APPEARED TO BE A STATUE WINSTON GAZED AT IT FOR SOME MOMENTS IT
SEEMED VAGUELY FAMILIAR THOUGH HE DID NOT REMEMBER THE STATUE

THE FRAMES FIXED TO THE WALL SAID THE OLD MAN BUT I COULD UNSCREW IT
FOR YOU I DARE SAY

I KNOW THAT BUILDING SAID WINSTON FINALLY ITS A RUIN NOW ITS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET OUTSIDE THE PALACE OF JUSTICE

THATS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE LAW COURTS IT WAS BOMBED INOH MANY YEARS
AGO IT WAS A CHURCH AT ONE TIME ST CLEMENT DANES ITS NAME WAS HE
SMILED APOLOGETICALLY AS THOUGH CONSCIOUS OF SAYING SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
RIDICULOUS AND ADDED ORANGES AND LEMONS SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS

WHATS THAT SAID WINSTON

OHORANGES AND LEMONS SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS THAT WAS A RHYME
WE HAD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY HOW IT GOES ON I DONT REMEMBER BUT I DO
KNOW IT ENDED UP HERE COMES A CANDLE TO LIGHT YOU TO BED HERE COMES A
CHOPPER TO CHOP OFF YOUR HEAD IT WAS A KIND OF A DANCE THEY HELD OUT
THEIR ARMS FOR YOU TO PASS UNDER AND WHEN THEY CAME TO HERE COMES A
CHOPPER TO CHOP OFF YOUR HEAD THEY BROUGHT THEIR ARMS DOWN AND CAUGHT YOU
IT WAS JUST NAMES OF CHURCHES ALL THE LONDON CHURCHES WERE IN ITALL THE
PRINCIPAL ONES THAT IS

WINSTON WONDERED VAGUELY TO WHAT CENTURY THE CHURCH BELONGED IT WAS ALWAYS
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF A LONDON BUILDING ANYTHING LARGE AND
IMPRESSIVE IF IT WAS REASONABLY NEW IN APPEARANCE WAS AUTOMATICALLY
CLAIMED AS HAVING BEEN BUILT SINCE THE REVOLUTION WHILE ANYTHING THAT WAS
OBVIOUSLY OF EARLIER DATE WAS ASCRIBED TO SOME DIM PERIOD CALLED THE MIDDLE
AGES THE CENTURIES OF CAPITALISM WERE HELD TO HAVE PRODUCED NOTHING OF ANY
VALUE ONE COULD NOT LEARN HISTORY FROM ARCHITECTURE ANY MORE THAN ONE
COULD LEARN IT FROM BOOKS STATUES INSCRIPTIONS MEMORIAL STONES THE
NAMES OF STREETSANYTHING THAT MIGHT THROW LIGHT UPON THE PAST HAD BEEN
SYSTEMATICALLY ALTERED

I NEVER KNEW IT HAD BEEN A CHURCH HE SAID

THERES A LOT OF THEM LEFT REALLY SAID THE OLD MAN THOUGH THEYVE
BEEN PUT TO OTHER USES NOW HOW DID THAT RHYME GO AH IVE GOT IT


ORANGES AND LEMONS SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS
YOU OWE ME THREE FARTHINGS SAY THE BELLS OF ST MARTINS


THERE NOW THATS AS FAR AS I CAN GET A FARTHING THAT WAS A SMALL COPPER
COIN LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE A CENT

WHERE WAS ST MARTINS SAID WINSTON

ST MARTINS THATS STILL STANDING ITS IN VICTORY SQUARE ALONGSIDE THE
PICTURE GALLERY A BUILDING WITH A KIND OF A TRIANGULAR PORCH AND PILLARS
IN FRONT AND A BIG FLIGHT OF STEPS

WINSTON KNEW THE PLACE WELL IT WAS A MUSEUM USED FOR PROPAGANDA DISPLAYS
OF VARIOUS KINDSSCALE MODELS OF ROCKET BOMBS AND FLOATING FORTRESSES
WAXWORK TABLEAUX ILLUSTRATING ENEMY ATROCITIES AND THE LIKE

ST MARTINSINTHEFIELDS IT USED TO BE CALLED SUPPLEMENTED THE OLD MAN
THOUGH I DONT RECOLLECT ANY FIELDS ANYWHERE IN THOSE PARTS

WINSTON DID NOT BUY THE PICTURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EVEN MORE
INCONGRUOUS POSSESSION THAN THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT AND IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY
HOME UNLESS IT WERE TAKEN OUT OF ITS FRAME BUT HE LINGERED FOR SOME
MINUTES MORE TALKING TO THE OLD MAN WHOSE NAME HE DISCOVERED WAS NOT
WEEKSAS ONE MIGHT HAVE GATHERED FROM THE INSCRIPTION OVER THE
SHOPFRONTBUT CHARRINGTON MR CHARRINGTON IT SEEMED WAS A WIDOWER AGED
SIXTYTHREE AND HAD INHABITED THIS SHOP FOR THIRTY YEARS THROUGHOUT THAT
TIME HE HAD BEEN INTENDING TO ALTER THE NAME OVER THE WINDOW BUT HAD NEVER
QUITE GOT TO THE POINT OF DOING IT ALL THE WHILE THAT THEY WERE TALKING
THE HALFREMEMBERED RHYME KEPT RUNNING THROUGH WINSTONS HEAD ORANGES AND
LEMONS SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS YOU OWE ME THREE FARTHINGS SAY
THE BELLS OF ST MARTINS IT WAS CURIOUS BUT WHEN YOU SAID IT TO YOURSELF
YOU HAD THE ILLUSION OF ACTUALLY HEARING BELLS THE BELLS OF A LOST LONDON
THAT STILL EXISTED SOMEWHERE OR OTHER DISGUISED AND FORGOTTEN FROM ONE
GHOSTLY STEEPLE AFTER ANOTHER HE SEEMED TO HEAR THEM PEALING FORTH YET SO
FAR AS HE COULD REMEMBER HE HAD NEVER IN REAL LIFE HEARD CHURCH BELLS
RINGING

HE GOT AWAY FROM MR CHARRINGTON AND WENT DOWN THE STAIRS ALONE SO AS NOT
TO LET THE OLD MAN SEE HIM RECONNOITRING THE STREET BEFORE STEPPING OUT OF
THE DOOR HE HAD ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT AFTER A SUITABLE
INTERVALA MONTH SAYHE WOULD TAKE THE RISK OF VISITING THE SHOP AGAIN
IT WAS PERHAPS NOT MORE DANGEROUS THAN SHIRKING AN EVENING AT THE CENTRE
THE SERIOUS PIECE OF FOLLY HAD BEEN TO COME BACK HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
AFTER BUYING THE DIARY AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER THE PROPRIETOR OF THE
SHOP COULD BE TRUSTED HOWEVER

YES HE THOUGHT AGAIN HE WOULD COME BACK HE WOULD BUY FURTHER SCRAPS OF
BEAUTIFUL RUBBISH HE WOULD BUY THE ENGRAVING OF ST CLEMENT DANES TAKE
IT OUT OF ITS FRAME AND CARRY IT HOME CONCEALED UNDER THE JACKET OF HIS
OVERALLS HE WOULD DRAG THE REST OF THAT POEM OUT OF MR CHARRINGTONS
MEMORY EVEN THE LUNATIC PROJECT OF RENTING THE ROOM UPSTAIRS FLASHED
MOMENTARILY THROUGH HIS MIND AGAIN FOR PERHAPS FIVE SECONDS EXALTATION
MADE HIM CARELESS AND HE STEPPED OUT ON TO THE PAVEMENT WITHOUT SO MUCH
AS A PRELIMINARY GLANCE THROUGH THE WINDOW HE HAD EVEN STARTED HUMMING
TO AN IMPROVISED TUNE


ORANGES AND LEMONS SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS
YOU OWE ME THREE FARTHINGS SAY THE


SUDDENLY HIS HEART SEEMED TO TURN TO ICE AND HIS BOWELS TO WATER A FIGURE
IN BLUE OVERALLS WAS COMING DOWN THE PAVEMENT NOT TEN METRES AWAY IT WAS
THE GIRL FROM THE FICTION DEPARTMENT THE GIRL WITH DARK HAIR THE LIGHT
WAS FAILING BUT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING HER SHE LOOKED
HIM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE THEN WALKED QUICKLY ON AS THOUGH SHE HAD NOT
SEEN HIM

FOR A FEW SECONDS WINSTON WAS TOO PARALYSED TO MOVE THEN HE TURNED TO THE
RIGHT AND WALKED HEAVILY AWAY NOT NOTICING FOR THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS
GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AT ANY RATE ONE QUESTION WAS SETTLED THERE
WAS NO DOUBTING ANY LONGER THAT THE GIRL WAS SPYING ON HIM SHE MUST HAVE
FOLLOWED HIM HERE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CREDIBLE THAT BY PURE CHANCE SHE
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO BE WALKING ON THE SAME EVENING UP THE SAME OBSCURE
BACKSTREET KILOMETRES DISTANT FROM ANY QUARTER WHERE PARTY MEMBERS LIVED
IT WAS TOO GREAT A COINCIDENCE WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY AN AGENT OF THE
THOUGHT POLICE OR SIMPLY AN AMATEUR SPY ACTUATED BY OFFICIOUSNESS HARDLY
MATTERED IT WAS ENOUGH THAT SHE WAS WATCHING HIM PROBABLY SHE HAD SEEN
HIM GO INTO THE PUB AS WELL

IT WAS AN EFFORT TO WALK THE LUMP OF GLASS IN HIS POCKET BANGED AGAINST
HIS THIGH AT EACH STEP AND HE WAS HALF MINDED TO TAKE IT OUT AND THROW IT
AWAY THE WORST THING WAS THE PAIN IN HIS BELLY FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
HE HAD THE FEELING THAT HE WOULD DIE IF HE DID NOT REACH A LAVATORY SOON
BUT THERE WOULD BE NO PUBLIC LAVATORIES IN A QUARTER LIKE THIS THEN THE
SPASM PASSED LEAVING A DULL ACHE BEHIND

THE STREET WAS A BLIND ALLEY WINSTON HALTED STOOD FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
WONDERING VAGUELY WHAT TO DO THEN TURNED ROUND AND BEGAN TO RETRACE HIS
STEPS AS HE TURNED IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE GIRL HAD ONLY PASSED HIM
THREE MINUTES AGO AND THAT BY RUNNING HE COULD PROBABLY CATCH UP WITH HER
HE COULD KEEP ON HER TRACK TILL THEY WERE IN SOME QUIET PLACE AND THEN
SMASH HER SKULL IN WITH A COBBLESTONE THE PIECE OF GLASS IN HIS POCKET
WOULD BE HEAVY ENOUGH FOR THE JOB BUT HE ABANDONED THE IDEA IMMEDIATELY
BECAUSE EVEN THE THOUGHT OF MAKING ANY PHYSICAL EFFORT WAS UNBEARABLE HE
COULD NOT RUN HE COULD NOT STRIKE A BLOW BESIDES SHE WAS YOUNG AND LUSTY
AND WOULD DEFEND HERSELF HE THOUGHT ALSO OF HURRYING TO THE COMMUNITY
CENTRE AND STAYING THERE TILL THE PLACE CLOSED SO AS TO ESTABLISH A
PARTIAL ALIBI FOR THE EVENING BUT THAT TOO WAS IMPOSSIBLE A DEADLY
LASSITUDE HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HIM ALL HE WANTED WAS TO GET HOME QUICKLY AND
THEN SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET

IT WAS AFTER TWENTYTWO HOURS WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE FLAT THE LIGHTS
WOULD BE SWITCHED OFF AT THE MAIN AT TWENTYTHREE THIRTY HE WENT INTO THE
KITCHEN AND SWALLOWED NEARLY A TEACUPFUL OF VICTORY GIN THEN HE WENT TO
THE TABLE IN THE ALCOVE SAT DOWN AND TOOK THE DIARY OUT OF THE DRAWER
BUT HE DID NOT OPEN IT AT ONCE FROM THE TELESCREEN A BRASSY FEMALE VOICE
WAS SQUALLING A PATRIOTIC SONG HE SAT STARING AT THE MARBLED COVER OF THE
BOOK TRYING WITHOUT SUCCESS TO SHUT THE VOICE OUT OF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS

IT WAS AT NIGHT THAT THEY CAME FOR YOU ALWAYS AT NIGHT THE PROPER THING
WAS TO KILL YOURSELF BEFORE THEY GOT YOU UNDOUBTEDLY SOME PEOPLE DID SO
MANY OF THE DISAPPEARANCES WERE ACTUALLY SUICIDES BUT IT NEEDED DESPERATE
COURAGE TO KILL YOURSELF IN A WORLD WHERE FIREARMS OR ANY QUICK AND
CERTAIN POISON WERE COMPLETELY UNPROCURABLE HE THOUGHT WITH A KIND OF
ASTONISHMENT OF THE BIOLOGICAL USELESSNESS OF PAIN AND FEAR THE TREACHERY
OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH ALWAYS FREEZES INTO INERTIA AT EXACTLY THE MOMENT
WHEN A SPECIAL EFFORT IS NEEDED HE MIGHT HAVE SILENCED THE DARKHAIRED
GIRL IF ONLY HE HAD ACTED QUICKLY ENOUGH BUT PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE
EXTREMITY OF HIS DANGER HE HAD LOST THE POWER TO ACT IT STRUCK HIM THAT
IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS ONE IS NEVER FIGHTING AGAINST AN EXTERNAL ENEMY BUT
ALWAYS AGAINST ONES OWN BODY EVEN NOW IN SPITE OF THE GIN THE DULL
ACHE IN HIS BELLY MADE CONSECUTIVE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE AND IT IS THE SAME
HE PERCEIVED IN ALL SEEMINGLY HEROIC OR TRAGIC SITUATIONS ON THE
BATTLEFIELD IN THE TORTURE CHAMBER ON A SINKING SHIP THE ISSUES THAT
YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR ARE ALWAYS FORGOTTEN BECAUSE THE BODY SWELLS UP UNTIL
IT FILLS THE UNIVERSE AND EVEN WHEN YOU ARE NOT PARALYSED BY FRIGHT OR
SCREAMING WITH PAIN LIFE IS A MOMENTTOMOMENT STRUGGLE AGAINST HUNGER OR
COLD OR SLEEPLESSNESS AGAINST A SOUR STOMACH OR AN ACHING TOOTH

HE OPENED THE DIARY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN THE WOMAN
ON THE TELESCREEN HAD STARTED A NEW SONG HER VOICE SEEMED TO STICK INTO
HIS BRAIN LIKE JAGGED SPLINTERS OF GLASS HE TRIED TO THINK OF OBRIEN
FOR WHOM OR TO WHOM THE DIARY WAS WRITTEN BUT INSTEAD HE BEGAN THINKING
OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM AFTER THE THOUGHT POLICE TOOK HIM
AWAY IT WOULD NOT MATTER IF THEY KILLED YOU AT ONCE TO BE KILLED WAS
WHAT YOU EXPECTED BUT BEFORE DEATH NOBODY SPOKE OF SUCH THINGS YET
EVERYBODY KNEW OF THEM THERE WAS THE ROUTINE OF CONFESSION THAT HAD TO
BE GONE THROUGH THE GROVELLING ON THE FLOOR AND SCREAMING FOR MERCY THE
CRACK OF BROKEN BONES THE SMASHED TEETH AND BLOODY CLOTS OF HAIR

WHY DID YOU HAVE TO ENDURE IT SINCE THE END WAS ALWAYS THE SAME WHY WAS
IT NOT POSSIBLE TO CUT A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS OUT OF YOUR LIFE NOBODY EVER
ESCAPED DETECTION AND NOBODY EVER FAILED TO CONFESS WHEN ONCE YOU HAD
SUCCUMBED TO THOUGHTCRIME IT WAS CERTAIN THAT BY A GIVEN DATE YOU WOULD BE
DEAD WHY THEN DID THAT HORROR WHICH ALTERED NOTHING HAVE TO LIE EMBEDDED
IN FUTURE TIME

HE TRIED WITH A LITTLE MORE SUCCESS THAN BEFORE TO SUMMON UP THE IMAGE OF
OBRIEN WE SHALL MEET IN THE PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO DARKNESS OBRIEN
HAD SAID TO HIM HE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT OR THOUGHT HE KNEW THE PLACE WHERE
THERE IS NO DARKNESS WAS THE IMAGINED FUTURE WHICH ONE WOULD NEVER SEE
BUT WHICH BY FOREKNOWLEDGE ONE COULD MYSTICALLY SHARE IN BUT WITH THE
VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN NAGGING AT HIS EARS HE COULD NOT FOLLOW THE TRAIN
OF THOUGHT FURTHER HE PUT A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH HALF THE TOBACCO
PROMPTLY FELL OUT ON TO HIS TONGUE A BITTER DUST WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO
SPIT OUT AGAIN THE FACE OF BIG BROTHER SWAM INTO HIS MIND DISPLACING THAT
OF OBRIEN JUST AS HE HAD DONE A FEW DAYS EARLIER HE SLID A COIN OUT OF
HIS POCKET AND LOOKED AT IT THE FACE GAZED UP AT HIM HEAVY CALM
PROTECTING BUT WHAT KIND OF SMILE WAS HIDDEN BENEATH THE DARK MOUSTACHE
LIKE A LEADEN KNELL THE WORDS CAME BACK AT HIM


WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH





PART TWO




CHAPTER 1



IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING AND WINSTON HAD LEFT THE CUBICLE TO GO
TO THE LAVATORY

A SOLITARY FIGURE WAS COMING TOWARDS HIM FROM THE OTHER END OF THE LONG
BRIGHTLYLIT CORRIDOR IT WAS THE GIRL WITH DARK HAIR FOUR DAYS HAD GONE
PAST SINCE THE EVENING WHEN HE HAD RUN INTO HER OUTSIDE THE JUNKSHOP
AS SHE CAME NEARER HE SAW THAT HER RIGHT ARM WAS IN A SLING NOT NOTICEABLE
AT A DISTANCE BECAUSE IT WAS OF THE SAME COLOUR AS HER OVERALLS PROBABLY
SHE HAD CRUSHED HER HAND WHILE SWINGING ROUND ONE OF THE BIG KALEIDOSCOPES
ON WHICH THE PLOTS OF NOVELS WERE ROUGHED IN IT WAS A COMMON ACCIDENT
IN THE FICTION DEPARTMENT

THEY WERE PERHAPS FOUR METRES APART WHEN THE GIRL STUMBLED AND FELL ALMOST
FLAT ON HER FACE A SHARP CRY OF PAIN WAS WRUNG OUT OF HER SHE MUST HAVE
FALLEN RIGHT ON THE INJURED ARM WINSTON STOPPED SHORT THE GIRL HAD RISEN
TO HER KNEES HER FACE HAD TURNED A MILKY YELLOW COLOUR AGAINST WHICH HER
MOUTH STOOD OUT REDDER THAN EVER HER EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS WITH AN
APPEALING EXPRESSION THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE FEAR THAN PAIN

A CURIOUS EMOTION STIRRED IN WINSTONS HEART IN FRONT OF HIM WAS AN ENEMY
WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM IN FRONT OF HIM ALSO WAS A HUMAN CREATURE
IN PAIN AND PERHAPS WITH A BROKEN BONE ALREADY HE HAD INSTINCTIVELY
STARTED FORWARD TO HELP HER IN THE MOMENT WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER FALL ON
THE BANDAGED ARM IT HAD BEEN AS THOUGH HE FELT THE PAIN IN HIS OWN BODY

YOURE HURT HE SAID

ITS NOTHING MY ARM ITLL BE ALL RIGHT IN A SECOND

SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH HER HEART WERE FLUTTERING SHE HAD CERTAINLY TURNED
VERY PALE

YOU HAVENT BROKEN ANYTHING

NO IM ALL RIGHT IT HURT FOR A MOMENT THATS ALL

SHE HELD OUT HER FREE HAND TO HIM AND HE HELPED HER UP SHE HAD REGAINED
SOME OF HER COLOUR AND APPEARED VERY MUCH BETTER

ITS NOTHING SHE REPEATED SHORTLY I ONLY GAVE MY WRIST A BIT OF A
BANG THANKS COMRADE

AND WITH THAT SHE WALKED ON IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN GOING
AS BRISKLY AS THOUGH IT HAD REALLY BEEN NOTHING THE WHOLE INCIDENT COULD
NOT HAVE TAKEN AS MUCH AS HALF A MINUTE NOT TO LET ONES FEELINGS APPEAR
IN ONES FACE WAS A HABIT THAT HAD ACQUIRED THE STATUS OF AN INSTINCT
AND IN ANY CASE THEY HAD BEEN STANDING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF A TELESCREEN
WHEN THE THING HAPPENED NEVERTHELESS IT HAD BEEN VERY DIFFICULT NOT TO
BETRAY A MOMENTARY SURPRISE FOR IN THE TWO OR THREE SECONDS WHILE HE WAS
HELPING HER UP THE GIRL HAD SLIPPED SOMETHING INTO HIS HAND THERE WAS NO
QUESTION THAT SHE HAD DONE IT INTENTIONALLY IT WAS SOMETHING SMALL AND
FLAT AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE LAVATORY DOOR HE TRANSFERRED IT TO HIS
POCKET AND FELT IT WITH THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS IT WAS A SCRAP OF PAPER
FOLDED INTO A SQUARE

WHILE HE STOOD AT THE URINAL HE MANAGED WITH A LITTLE MORE FINGERING TO
GET IT UNFOLDED OBVIOUSLY THERE MUST BE A MESSAGE OF SOME KIND WRITTEN ON
IT FOR A MOMENT HE WAS TEMPTED TO TAKE IT INTO ONE OF THE WATERCLOSETS
AND READ IT AT ONCE BUT THAT WOULD BE SHOCKING FOLLY AS HE WELL KNEW
THERE WAS NO PLACE WHERE YOU COULD BE MORE CERTAIN THAT THE TELESCREENS
WERE WATCHED CONTINUOUSLY

HE WENT BACK TO HIS CUBICLE SAT DOWN THREW THE FRAGMENT OF PAPER
CASUALLY AMONG THE OTHER PAPERS ON THE DESK PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES AND
HITCHED THE SPEAKWRITE TOWARDS HIM FIVE MINUTES HE TOLD HIMSELF
FIVE MINUTES AT THE VERY LEAST HIS HEART BUMPED IN HIS BREAST WITH
FRIGHTENING LOUDNESS FORTUNATELY THE PIECE OF WORK HE WAS ENGAGED ON WAS
MERE ROUTINE THE RECTIFICATION OF A LONG LIST OF FIGURES NOT NEEDING
CLOSE ATTENTION

WHATEVER WAS WRITTEN ON THE PAPER IT MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF POLITICAL
MEANING SO FAR AS HE COULD SEE THERE WERE TWO POSSIBILITIES ONE MUCH
THE MORE LIKELY WAS THAT THE GIRL WAS AN AGENT OF THE THOUGHT POLICE
JUST AS HE HAD FEARED HE DID NOT KNOW WHY THE THOUGHT POLICE SHOULD
CHOOSE TO DELIVER THEIR MESSAGES IN SUCH A FASHION BUT PERHAPS THEY HAD
THEIR REASONS THE THING THAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE PAPER MIGHT BE A THREAT A
SUMMONS AN ORDER TO COMMIT SUICIDE A TRAP OF SOME DESCRIPTION BUT THERE
WAS ANOTHER WILDER POSSIBILITY THAT KEPT RAISING ITS HEAD THOUGH HE
TRIED VAINLY TO SUPPRESS IT THIS WAS THAT THE MESSAGE DID NOT COME FROM
THE THOUGHT POLICE AT ALL BUT FROM SOME KIND OF UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION
PERHAPS THE BROTHERHOOD EXISTED AFTER ALL PERHAPS THE GIRL WAS PART OF IT
NO DOUBT THE IDEA WAS ABSURD BUT IT HAD SPRUNG INTO HIS MIND IN THE VERY
INSTANT OF FEELING THE SCRAP OF PAPER IN HIS HAND IT WAS NOT TILL A COUPLE
OF MINUTES LATER THAT THE OTHER MORE PROBABLE EXPLANATION HAD OCCURRED TO
HIM AND EVEN NOW THOUGH HIS INTELLECT TOLD HIM THAT THE MESSAGE PROBABLY
MEANT DEATHSTILL THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE BELIEVED AND THE UNREASONABLE
HOPE PERSISTED AND HIS HEART BANGED AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT HE
KEPT HIS VOICE FROM TREMBLING AS HE MURMURED HIS FIGURES INTO THE
SPEAKWRITE

HE ROLLED UP THE COMPLETED BUNDLE OF WORK AND SLID IT INTO THE PNEUMATIC
TUBE EIGHT MINUTES HAD GONE BY HE READJUSTED HIS SPECTACLES ON HIS NOSE
SIGHED AND DREW THE NEXT BATCH OF WORK TOWARDS HIM WITH THE SCRAP OF
PAPER ON TOP OF IT HE FLATTENED IT OUT ON IT WAS WRITTEN IN A LARGE
UNFORMED HANDWRITING

I LOVE YOU

FOR SEVERAL SECONDS HE WAS TOO STUNNED EVEN TO THROW THE INCRIMINATING
THING INTO THE MEMORY HOLE WHEN HE DID SO ALTHOUGH HE KNEW VERY WELL THE
DANGER OF SHOWING TOO MUCH INTEREST HE COULD NOT RESIST READING IT ONCE
AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORDS WERE REALLY THERE

FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK WHAT WAS EVEN
WORSE THAN HAVING TO FOCUS HIS MIND ON A SERIES OF NIGGLING JOBS WAS THE
NEED TO CONCEAL HIS AGITATION FROM THE TELESCREEN HE FELT AS THOUGH A
FIRE WERE BURNING IN HIS BELLY LUNCH IN THE HOT CROWDED NOISEFILLED
CANTEEN WAS TORMENT HE HAD HOPED TO BE ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE DURING
THE LUNCH HOUR BUT AS BAD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THE IMBECILE PARSONS FLOPPED
DOWN BESIDE HIM THE TANG OF HIS SWEAT ALMOST DEFEATING THE TINNY SMELL OF
STEW AND KEPT UP A STREAM OF TALK ABOUT THE PREPARATIONS FOR HATE WEEK
HE WAS PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A PAPIERMACHE MODEL OF BIG
BROTHERS HEAD TWO METRES WIDE WHICH WAS BEING MADE FOR THE OCCASION BY
HIS DAUGHTERS TROOP OF SPIES THE IRRITATING THING WAS THAT IN THE RACKET
OF VOICES WINSTON COULD HARDLY HEAR WHAT PARSONS WAS SAYING AND WAS
CONSTANTLY HAVING TO ASK FOR SOME FATUOUS REMARK TO BE REPEATED JUST ONCE
HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GIRL AT A TABLE WITH TWO OTHER GIRLS AT THE
FAR END OF THE ROOM SHE APPEARED NOT TO HAVE SEEN HIM AND HE DID NOT
LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN

THE AFTERNOON WAS MORE BEARABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER LUNCH THERE ARRIVED A
DELICATE DIFFICULT PIECE OF WORK WHICH WOULD TAKE SEVERAL HOURS AND
NECESSITATED PUTTING EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE IT CONSISTED IN FALSIFYING A
SERIES OF PRODUCTION REPORTS OF TWO YEARS AGO IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CAST
DISCREDIT ON A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE INNER PARTY WHO WAS NOW UNDER A
CLOUD THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT WINSTON WAS GOOD AT AND FOR MORE
THAN TWO HOURS HE SUCCEEDED IN SHUTTING THE GIRL OUT OF HIS MIND
ALTOGETHER THEN THE MEMORY OF HER FACE CAME BACK AND WITH IT A RAGING
INTOLERABLE DESIRE TO BE ALONE UNTIL HE COULD BE ALONE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO THINK THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT OUT TONIGHT WAS ONE OF HIS NIGHTS AT THE
COMMUNITY CENTRE HE WOLFED ANOTHER TASTELESS MEAL IN THE CANTEEN HURRIED
OFF TO THE CENTRE TOOK PART IN THE SOLEMN FOOLERY OF A DISCUSSION GROUP
PLAYED TWO GAMES OF TABLE TENNIS SWALLOWED SEVERAL GLASSES OF GIN AND
SAT FOR HALF AN HOUR THROUGH A LECTURE ENTITLED INGSOC IN RELATION TO
CHESS HIS SOUL WRITHED WITH BOREDOM BUT FOR ONCE HE HAD HAD NO IMPULSE
TO SHIRK HIS EVENING AT THE CENTRE AT THE SIGHT OF THE WORDS I LOVE YOU
THE DESIRE TO STAY ALIVE HAD WELLED UP IN HIM AND THE TAKING OF MINOR
RISKS SUDDENLY SEEMED STUPID IT WAS NOT TILL TWENTYTHREE HOURS WHEN HE
WAS HOME AND IN BEDIN THE DARKNESS WHERE YOU WERE SAFE EVEN FROM THE
TELESCREEN SO LONG AS YOU KEPT SILENTTHAT HE WAS ABLE TO THINK
CONTINUOUSLY

IT WAS A PHYSICAL PROBLEM THAT HAD TO BE SOLVED HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH
THE GIRL AND ARRANGE A MEETING HE DID NOT CONSIDER ANY LONGER THE
POSSIBILITY THAT SHE MIGHT BE LAYING SOME KIND OF TRAP FOR HIM HE KNEW
THAT IT WAS NOT SO BECAUSE OF HER UNMISTAKABLE AGITATION WHEN SHE HANDED
HIM THE NOTE OBVIOUSLY SHE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER WITS AS WELL
SHE MIGHT BE NOR DID THE IDEA OF REFUSING HER ADVANCES EVEN CROSS HIS
MIND ONLY FIVE NIGHTS AGO HE HAD CONTEMPLATED SMASHING HER SKULL IN WITH
A COBBLESTONE BUT THAT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE HE THOUGHT OF HER NAKED
YOUTHFUL BODY AS HE HAD SEEN IT IN HIS DREAM HE HAD IMAGINED HER A FOOL
LIKE ALL THE REST OF THEM HER HEAD STUFFED WITH LIES AND HATRED HER
BELLY FULL OF ICE A KIND OF FEVER SEIZED HIM AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT
LOSE HER THE WHITE YOUTHFUL BODY MIGHT SLIP AWAY FROM HIM WHAT HE FEARED
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS THAT SHE WOULD SIMPLY CHANGE HER MIND IF HE
DID NOT GET IN TOUCH WITH HER QUICKLY BUT THE PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY OF
MEETING WAS ENORMOUS IT WAS LIKE TRYING TO MAKE A MOVE AT CHESS WHEN YOU
WERE ALREADY MATED WHICHEVER WAY YOU TURNED THE TELESCREEN FACED YOU
ACTUALLY ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS OF COMMUNICATING WITH HER HAD OCCURRED TO
HIM WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF READING THE NOTE BUT NOW WITH TIME TO THINK
HE WENT OVER THEM ONE BY ONE AS THOUGH LAYING OUT A ROW OF INSTRUMENTS
ON A TABLE

OBVIOUSLY THE KIND OF ENCOUNTER THAT HAD HAPPENED THIS MORNING COULD NOT
BE REPEATED IF SHE HAD WORKED IN THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE BUT HE HAD ONLY A VERY DIM IDEA WHEREABOUTS IN
THE BUILDING THE FICTION DEPARTMENT LAY AND HE HAD NO PRETEXT FOR GOING
THERE IF HE HAD KNOWN WHERE SHE LIVED AND AT WHAT TIME SHE LEFT WORK
HE COULD HAVE CONTRIVED TO MEET HER SOMEWHERE ON HER WAY HOME BUT TO TRY
TO FOLLOW HER HOME WAS NOT SAFE BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN LOITERING ABOUT
OUTSIDE THE MINISTRY WHICH WAS BOUND TO BE NOTICED AS FOR SENDING A
LETTER THROUGH THE MAILS IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION BY A ROUTINE THAT
WAS NOT EVEN SECRET ALL LETTERS WERE OPENED IN TRANSIT ACTUALLY FEW
PEOPLE EVER WROTE LETTERS FOR THE MESSAGES THAT IT WAS OCCASIONALLY
NECESSARY TO SEND THERE WERE PRINTED POSTCARDS WITH LONG LISTS OF PHRASES
AND YOU STRUCK OUT THE ONES THAT WERE INAPPLICABLE IN ANY CASE HE DID NOT
KNOW THE GIRLS NAME LET ALONE HER ADDRESS FINALLY HE DECIDED THAT THE
SAFEST PLACE WAS THE CANTEEN IF HE COULD GET HER AT A TABLE BY HERSELF
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM NOT TOO NEAR THE TELESCREENS AND
WITH A SUFFICIENT BUZZ OF CONVERSATION ALL ROUNDIF THESE CONDITIONS
ENDURED FOR SAY THIRTY SECONDS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE A FEW
WORDS

FOR A WEEK AFTER THIS LIFE WAS LIKE A RESTLESS DREAM ON THE NEXT DAY SHE
DID NOT APPEAR IN THE CANTEEN UNTIL HE WAS LEAVING IT THE WHISTLE HAVING
ALREADY BLOWN PRESUMABLY SHE HAD BEEN CHANGED ON TO A LATER SHIFT THEY
PASSED EACH OTHER WITHOUT A GLANCE ON THE DAY AFTER THAT SHE WAS IN THE
CANTEEN AT THE USUAL TIME BUT WITH THREE OTHER GIRLS AND IMMEDIATELY
UNDER A TELESCREEN THEN FOR THREE DREADFUL DAYS SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT
ALL HIS WHOLE MIND AND BODY SEEMED TO BE AFFLICTED WITH AN UNBEARABLE
SENSITIVITY A SORT OF TRANSPARENCY WHICH MADE EVERY MOVEMENT EVERY
SOUND EVERY CONTACT EVERY WORD THAT HE HAD TO SPEAK OR LISTEN TO AN
AGONY EVEN IN SLEEP HE COULD NOT ALTOGETHER ESCAPE FROM HER IMAGE HE DID
NOT TOUCH THE DIARY DURING THOSE DAYS IF THERE WAS ANY RELIEF IT WAS IN
HIS WORK IN WHICH HE COULD SOMETIMES FORGET HIMSELF FOR TEN MINUTES AT A
STRETCH HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER THERE
WAS NO ENQUIRY HE COULD MAKE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VAPORIZED SHE MIGHT
HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE OTHER END
OF OCEANIA WORST AND LIKELIEST OF ALL SHE MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE CHANGED HER
MIND AND DECIDED TO AVOID HIM

THE NEXT DAY SHE REAPPEARED HER ARM WAS OUT OF THE SLING AND SHE HAD A
BAND OF STICKINGPLASTER ROUND HER WRIST THE RELIEF OF SEEING HER WAS
SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST STARING DIRECTLY AT HER FOR SEVERAL
SECONDS ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE VERY NEARLY SUCCEEDED IN SPEAKING TO HER
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CANTEEN SHE WAS SITTING AT A TABLE WELL OUT FROM THE
WALL AND WAS QUITE ALONE IT WAS EARLY AND THE PLACE WAS NOT VERY FULL
THE QUEUE EDGED FORWARD TILL WINSTON WAS ALMOST AT THE COUNTER THEN WAS
HELD UP FOR TWO MINUTES BECAUSE SOMEONE IN FRONT WAS COMPLAINING THAT HE
HAD NOT RECEIVED HIS TABLET OF SACCHARINE BUT THE GIRL WAS STILL ALONE
WHEN WINSTON SECURED HIS TRAY AND BEGAN TO MAKE FOR HER TABLE HE WALKED
CASUALLY TOWARDS HER HIS EYES SEARCHING FOR A PLACE AT SOME TABLE BEYOND
HER SHE WAS PERHAPS THREE METRES AWAY FROM HIM ANOTHER TWO SECONDS WOULD
DO IT THEN A VOICE BEHIND HIM CALLED SMITH HE PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR
SMITH REPEATED THE VOICE MORE LOUDLY IT WAS NO USE HE TURNED ROUND
A BLONDHEADED SILLYFACED YOUNG MAN NAMED WILSHER WHOM HE BARELY KNEW
WAS INVITING HIM WITH A SMILE TO A VACANT PLACE AT HIS TABLE IT WAS NOT
SAFE TO REFUSE AFTER HAVING BEEN RECOGNIZED HE COULD NOT GO AND SIT AT
A TABLE WITH AN UNATTENDED GIRL IT WAS TOO NOTICEABLE HE SAT DOWN WITH
A FRIENDLY SMILE THE SILLY BLOND FACE BEAMED INTO HIS WINSTON HAD A
HALLUCINATION OF HIMSELF SMASHING A PICKAXE RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF IT
THE GIRLS TABLE FILLED UP A FEW MINUTES LATER

BUT SHE MUST HAVE SEEN HIM COMING TOWARDS HER AND PERHAPS SHE WOULD TAKE
THE HINT NEXT DAY HE TOOK CARE TO ARRIVE EARLY SURELY ENOUGH SHE WAS AT
A TABLE IN ABOUT THE SAME PLACE AND AGAIN ALONE THE PERSON IMMEDIATELY
AHEAD OF HIM IN THE QUEUE WAS A SMALL SWIFTLYMOVING BEETLELIKE MAN
WITH A FLAT FACE AND TINY SUSPICIOUS EYES AS WINSTON TURNED AWAY FROM
THE COUNTER WITH HIS TRAY HE SAW THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS MAKING STRAIGHT
FOR THE GIRLS TABLE HIS HOPES SANK AGAIN THERE WAS A VACANT PLACE AT A
TABLE FURTHER AWAY BUT SOMETHING IN THE LITTLE MANS APPEARANCE SUGGESTED
THAT HE WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY ATTENTIVE TO HIS OWN COMFORT TO CHOOSE THE
EMPTIEST TABLE WITH ICE AT HIS HEART WINSTON FOLLOWED IT WAS NO USE
UNLESS HE COULD GET THE GIRL ALONE AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS
CRASH THE LITTLE MAN WAS SPRAWLING ON ALL FOURS HIS TRAY HAD GONE FLYING
TWO STREAMS OF SOUP AND COFFEE WERE FLOWING ACROSS THE FLOOR HE STARTED
TO HIS FEET WITH A MALIGNANT GLANCE AT WINSTON WHOM HE EVIDENTLY
SUSPECTED OF HAVING TRIPPED HIM UP BUT IT WAS ALL RIGHT FIVE SECONDS
LATER WITH A THUNDERING HEART WINSTON WAS SITTING AT THE GIRLS TABLE

HE DID NOT LOOK AT HER HE UNPACKED HIS TRAY AND PROMPTLY BEGAN EATING
IT WAS ALLIMPORTANT TO SPEAK AT ONCE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE CAME BUT NOW
A TERRIBLE FEAR HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM A WEEK HAD GONE BY SINCE
SHE HAD FIRST APPROACHED HIM SHE WOULD HAVE CHANGED HER MIND SHE MUST
HAVE CHANGED HER MIND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS AFFAIR SHOULD END
SUCCESSFULLY SUCH THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE HE MIGHT HAVE
FLINCHED ALTOGETHER FROM SPEAKING IF AT THIS MOMENT HE HAD NOT SEEN
AMPLEFORTH THE HAIRYEARED POET WANDERING LIMPLY ROUND THE ROOM WITH
A TRAY LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO SIT DOWN IN HIS VAGUE WAY AMPLEFORTH
WAS ATTACHED TO WINSTON AND WOULD CERTAINLY SIT DOWN AT HIS TABLE IF
HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM THERE WAS PERHAPS A MINUTE IN WHICH TO ACT BOTH
WINSTON AND THE GIRL WERE EATING STEADILY THE STUFF THEY WERE EATING WAS
A THIN STEW ACTUALLY A SOUP OF HARICOT BEANS IN A LOW MURMUR WINSTON
BEGAN SPEAKING NEITHER OF THEM LOOKED UP STEADILY THEY SPOONED THE
WATERY STUFF INTO THEIR MOUTHS AND BETWEEN SPOONFULS EXCHANGED THE FEW
NECESSARY WORDS IN LOW EXPRESSIONLESS VOICES

WHAT TIME DO YOU LEAVE WORK

EIGHTEENTHIRTY

WHERE CAN WE MEET

VICTORY SQUARE NEAR THE MONUMENT

ITS FULL OF TELESCREENS

IT DOESNT MATTER IF THERES A CROWD

ANY SIGNAL

NO DONT COME UP TO ME UNTIL YOU SEE ME AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE AND DONT
LOOK AT ME JUST KEEP SOMEWHERE NEAR ME

WHAT TIME

NINETEEN HOURS

ALL RIGHT

AMPLEFORTH FAILED TO SEE WINSTON AND SAT DOWN AT ANOTHER TABLE THEY DID
NOT SPEAK AGAIN AND SO FAR AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR TWO PEOPLE SITTING ON
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE SAME TABLE THEY DID NOT LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER THE
GIRL FINISHED HER LUNCH QUICKLY AND MADE OFF WHILE WINSTON STAYED TO
SMOKE A CIGARETTE

WINSTON WAS IN VICTORY SQUARE BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME HE WANDERED ROUND
THE BASE OF THE ENORMOUS FLUTED COLUMN AT THE TOP OF WHICH BIG BROTHERS
STATUE GAZED SOUTHWARD TOWARDS THE SKIES WHERE HE HAD VANQUISHED THE
EURASIAN AEROPLANES THE EASTASIAN AEROPLANES IT HAD BEEN A FEW YEARS
AGO IN THE BATTLE OF AIRSTRIP ONE IN THE STREET IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS
A STATUE OF A MAN ON HORSEBACK WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT OLIVER
CROMWELL AT FIVE MINUTES PAST THE HOUR THE GIRL HAD STILL NOT APPEARED
AGAIN THE TERRIBLE FEAR SEIZED UPON WINSTON SHE WAS NOT COMING SHE HAD
CHANGED HER MIND HE WALKED SLOWLY UP TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SQUARE AND
GOT A SORT OF PALECOLOURED PLEASURE FROM IDENTIFYING ST MARTINS CHURCH
WHOSE BELLS WHEN IT HAD BELLS HAD CHIMED YOU OWE ME THREE FARTHINGS
THEN HE SAW THE GIRL STANDING AT THE BASE OF THE MONUMENT READING OR
PRETENDING TO READ A POSTER WHICH RAN SPIRALLY UP THE COLUMN IT WAS NOT
SAFE TO GO NEAR HER UNTIL SOME MORE PEOPLE HAD ACCUMULATED THERE WERE
TELESCREENS ALL ROUND THE PEDIMENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DIN OF
SHOUTING AND A ZOOM OF HEAVY VEHICLES FROM SOMEWHERE TO THE LEFT SUDDENLY
EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE RUNNING ACROSS THE SQUARE THE GIRL NIPPED NIMBLY
ROUND THE LIONS AT THE BASE OF THE MONUMENT AND JOINED IN THE RUSH
WINSTON FOLLOWED AS HE RAN HE GATHERED FROM SOME SHOUTED REMARKS THAT
A CONVOY OF EURASIAN PRISONERS WAS PASSING

ALREADY A DENSE MASS OF PEOPLE WAS BLOCKING THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE SQUARE
WINSTON AT NORMAL TIMES THE KIND OF PERSON WHO GRAVITATES TO THE OUTER
EDGE OF ANY KIND OF SCRIMMAGE SHOVED BUTTED SQUIRMED HIS WAY FORWARD
INTO THE HEART OF THE CROWD SOON HE WAS WITHIN ARMS LENGTH OF THE GIRL
BUT THE WAY WAS BLOCKED BY AN ENORMOUS PROLE AND AN ALMOST EQUALLY ENORMOUS
WOMAN PRESUMABLY HIS WIFE WHO SEEMED TO FORM AN IMPENETRABLE WALL OF
FLESH WINSTON WRIGGLED HIMSELF SIDEWAYS AND WITH A VIOLENT LUNGE MANAGED
TO DRIVE HIS SHOULDER BETWEEN THEM FOR A MOMENT IT FELT AS THOUGH HIS
ENTRAILS WERE BEING GROUND TO PULP BETWEEN THE TWO MUSCULAR HIPS THEN HE
HAD BROKEN THROUGH SWEATING A LITTLE HE WAS NEXT TO THE GIRL THEY WERE
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER BOTH STARING FIXEDLY IN FRONT OF THEM

A LONG LINE OF TRUCKS WITH WOODENFACED GUARDS ARMED WITH SUBMACHINE
GUNS STANDING UPRIGHT IN EACH CORNER WAS PASSING SLOWLY DOWN THE STREET
IN THE TRUCKS LITTLE YELLOW MEN IN SHABBY GREENISH UNIFORMS WERE SQUATTING
JAMMED CLOSE TOGETHER THEIR SAD MONGOLIAN FACES GAZED OUT OVER THE SIDES
OF THE TRUCKS UTTERLY INCURIOUS OCCASIONALLY WHEN A TRUCK JOLTED THERE
WAS A CLANKCLANK OF METAL ALL THE PRISONERS WERE WEARING LEGIRONS
TRUCKLOAD AFTER TRUCKLOAD OF THE SAD FACES PASSED WINSTON KNEW THEY
WERE THERE BUT HE SAW THEM ONLY INTERMITTENTLY THE GIRLS SHOULDER AND
HER ARM RIGHT DOWN TO THE ELBOW WERE PRESSED AGAINST HIS HER CHEEK WAS
ALMOST NEAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO FEEL ITS WARMTH SHE HAD IMMEDIATELY TAKEN
CHARGE OF THE SITUATION JUST AS SHE HAD DONE IN THE CANTEEN SHE BEGAN
SPEAKING IN THE SAME EXPRESSIONLESS VOICE AS BEFORE WITH LIPS BARELY
MOVING A MERE MURMUR EASILY DROWNED BY THE DIN OF VOICES AND THE RUMBLING
OF THE TRUCKS

CAN YOU HEAR ME

YES

CAN YOU GET SUNDAY AFTERNOON OFF

YES

THEN LISTEN CAREFULLY YOULL HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS GO TO PADDINGTON
STATION

WITH A SORT OF MILITARY PRECISION THAT ASTONISHED HIM SHE OUTLINED THE
ROUTE THAT HE WAS TO FOLLOW A HALFHOUR RAILWAY JOURNEY TURN LEFT OUTSIDE
THE STATION TWO KILOMETRES ALONG THE ROAD A GATE WITH THE TOP BAR
MISSING A PATH ACROSS A FIELD A GRASSGROWN LANE A TRACK BETWEEN BUSHES
A DEAD TREE WITH MOSS ON IT IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE HAD A MAP INSIDE HER
HEAD CAN YOU REMEMBER ALL THAT SHE MURMURED FINALLY

YES

YOU TURN LEFT THEN RIGHT THEN LEFT AGAIN AND THE GATES GOT NO TOP BAR

YES WHAT TIME

ABOUT FIFTEEN YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT ILL GET THERE BY ANOTHER WAY ARE
YOU SURE YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING

YES

THEN GET AWAY FROM ME AS QUICK AS YOU CAN

SHE NEED NOT HAVE TOLD HIM THAT BUT FOR THE MOMENT THEY COULD NOT
EXTRICATE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD THE TRUCKS WERE STILL FILING PAST
THE PEOPLE STILL INSATIABLY GAPING AT THE START THERE HAD BEEN A FEW BOOS
AND HISSES BUT IT CAME ONLY FROM THE PARTY MEMBERS AMONG THE CROWD AND
HAD SOON STOPPED THE PREVAILING EMOTION WAS SIMPLY CURIOSITY FOREIGNERS
WHETHER FROM EURASIA OR FROM EASTASIA WERE A KIND OF STRANGE ANIMAL ONE
LITERALLY NEVER SAW THEM EXCEPT IN THE GUISE OF PRISONERS AND EVEN AS
PRISONERS ONE NEVER GOT MORE THAN A MOMENTARY GLIMPSE OF THEM NOR DID
ONE KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THEM APART FROM THE FEW WHO WERE HANGED AS
WARCRIMINALS THE OTHERS SIMPLY VANISHED PRESUMABLY INTO FORCEDLABOUR
CAMPS THE ROUND MOGOL FACES HAD GIVEN WAY TO FACES OF A MORE EUROPEAN
TYPE DIRTY BEARDED AND EXHAUSTED FROM OVER SCRUBBY CHEEKBONES EYES
LOOKED INTO WINSTONS SOMETIMES WITH STRANGE INTENSITY AND FLASHED AWAY
AGAIN THE CONVOY WAS DRAWING TO AN END IN THE LAST TRUCK HE COULD SEE AN
AGED MAN HIS FACE A MASS OF GRIZZLED HAIR STANDING UPRIGHT WITH WRISTS
CROSSED IN FRONT OF HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE USED TO HAVING THEM BOUND
TOGETHER IT WAS ALMOST TIME FOR WINSTON AND THE GIRL TO PART BUT AT THE
LAST MOMENT WHILE THE CROWD STILL HEMMED THEM IN HER HAND FELT FOR HIS
AND GAVE IT A FLEETING SQUEEZE

IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN TEN SECONDS AND YET IT SEEMED A LONG TIME THAT
THEIR HANDS WERE CLASPED TOGETHER HE HAD TIME TO LEARN EVERY DETAIL
OF HER HAND HE EXPLORED THE LONG FINGERS THE SHAPELY NAILS THE
WORKHARDENED PALM WITH ITS ROW OF CALLOUSES THE SMOOTH FLESH UNDER THE
WRIST MERELY FROM FEELING IT HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT BY SIGHT IN THE
SAME INSTANT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT COLOUR THE
GIRLS EYES WERE THEY WERE PROBABLY BROWN BUT PEOPLE WITH DARK HAIR
SOMETIMES HAD BLUE EYES TO TURN HIS HEAD AND LOOK AT HER WOULD HAVE
BEEN INCONCEIVABLE FOLLY WITH HANDS LOCKED TOGETHER INVISIBLE AMONG
THE PRESS OF BODIES THEY STARED STEADILY IN FRONT OF THEM AND INSTEAD
OF THE EYES OF THE GIRL THE EYES OF THE AGED PRISONER GAZED MOURNFULLY
AT WINSTON OUT OF NESTS OF HAIR




CHAPTER 2



WINSTON PICKED HIS WAY UP THE LANE THROUGH DAPPLED LIGHT AND SHADE
STEPPING OUT INTO POOLS OF GOLD WHEREVER THE BOUGHS PARTED UNDER THE
TREES TO THE LEFT OF HIM THE GROUND WAS MISTY WITH BLUEBELLS THE AIR
SEEMED TO KISS ONES SKIN IT WAS THE SECOND OF MAY FROM SOMEWHERE DEEPER
IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD CAME THE DRONING OF RINGDOVES

HE WAS A BIT EARLY THERE HAD BEEN NO DIFFICULTIES ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND
THE GIRL WAS SO EVIDENTLY EXPERIENCED THAT HE WAS LESS FRIGHTENED THAN HE
WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN PRESUMABLY SHE COULD BE TRUSTED TO FIND A SAFE
PLACE IN GENERAL YOU COULD NOT ASSUME THAT YOU WERE MUCH SAFER IN THE
COUNTRY THAN IN LONDON THERE WERE NO TELESCREENS OF COURSE BUT THERE
WAS ALWAYS THE DANGER OF CONCEALED MICROPHONES BY WHICH YOUR VOICE MIGHT
BE PICKED UP AND RECOGNIZED BESIDES IT WAS NOT EASY TO MAKE A JOURNEY
BY YOURSELF WITHOUT ATTRACTING ATTENTION FOR DISTANCES OF LESS THAN
100 KILOMETRES IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO GET YOUR PASSPORT ENDORSED BUT
SOMETIMES THERE WERE PATROLS HANGING ABOUT THE RAILWAY STATIONS WHO
EXAMINED THE PAPERS OF ANY PARTY MEMBER THEY FOUND THERE AND ASKED AWKWARD
QUESTIONS HOWEVER NO PATROLS HAD APPEARED AND ON THE WALK FROM THE
STATION HE HAD MADE SURE BY CAUTIOUS BACKWARD GLANCES THAT HE WAS NOT
BEING FOLLOWED THE TRAIN WAS FULL OF PROLES IN HOLIDAY MOOD BECAUSE OF
THE SUMMERY WEATHER THE WOODENSEATED CARRIAGE IN WHICH HE TRAVELLED WAS
FILLED TO OVERFLOWING BY A SINGLE ENORMOUS FAMILY RANGING FROM A TOOTHLESS
GREATGRANDMOTHER TO A MONTHOLD BABY GOING OUT TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON
WITH INLAWS IN THE COUNTRY AND AS THEY FREELY EXPLAINED TO WINSTON
TO GET HOLD OF A LITTLE BLACKMARKET BUTTER

THE LANE WIDENED AND IN A MINUTE HE CAME TO THE FOOTPATH SHE HAD TOLD HIM
OF A MERE CATTLETRACK WHICH PLUNGED BETWEEN THE BUSHES HE HAD NO WATCH
BUT IT COULD NOT BE FIFTEEN YET THE BLUEBELLS WERE SO THICK UNDERFOOT
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TREAD ON THEM HE KNELT DOWN AND BEGAN
PICKING SOME PARTLY TO PASS THE TIME AWAY BUT ALSO FROM A VAGUE IDEA THAT
HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BUNCH OF FLOWERS TO OFFER TO THE GIRL WHEN THEY
MET HE HAD GOT TOGETHER A BIG BUNCH AND WAS SMELLING THEIR FAINT SICKLY
SCENT WHEN A SOUND AT HIS BACK FROZE HIM THE UNMISTAKABLE CRACKLE OF A
FOOT ON TWIGS HE WENT ON PICKING BLUEBELLS IT WAS THE BEST THING TO DO
IT MIGHT BE THE GIRL OR HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED AFTER ALL TO LOOK
ROUND WAS TO SHOW GUILT HE PICKED ANOTHER AND ANOTHER A HAND FELL
LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDER

HE LOOKED UP IT WAS THE GIRL SHE SHOOK HER HEAD EVIDENTLY AS A WARNING
THAT HE MUST KEEP SILENT THEN PARTED THE BUSHES AND QUICKLY LED THE WAY
ALONG THE NARROW TRACK INTO THE WOOD OBVIOUSLY SHE HAD BEEN THAT WAY
BEFORE FOR SHE DODGED THE BOGGY BITS AS THOUGH BY HABIT WINSTON FOLLOWED
STILL CLASPING HIS BUNCH OF FLOWERS HIS FIRST FEELING WAS RELIEF BUT AS
HE WATCHED THE STRONG SLENDER BODY MOVING IN FRONT OF HIM WITH THE SCARLET
SASH THAT WAS JUST TIGHT ENOUGH TO BRING OUT THE CURVE OF HER HIPS THE
SENSE OF HIS OWN INFERIORITY WAS HEAVY UPON HIM EVEN NOW IT SEEMED QUITE
LIKELY THAT WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE WOULD DRAW BACK
AFTER ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE AIR AND THE GREENNESS OF THE LEAVES DAUNTED
HIM ALREADY ON THE WALK FROM THE STATION THE MAY SUNSHINE HAD MADE HIM
FEEL DIRTY AND ETIOLATED A CREATURE OF INDOORS WITH THE SOOTY DUST OF
LONDON IN THE PORES OF HIS SKIN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT TILL NOW SHE HAD
PROBABLY NEVER SEEN HIM IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THE OPEN THEY CAME TO THE
FALLEN TREE THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN OF THE GIRL HOPPED OVER AND FORCED APART
THE BUSHES IN WHICH THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AN OPENING WHEN WINSTON
FOLLOWED HER HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE IN A NATURAL CLEARING A TINY GRASSY
KNOLL SURROUNDED BY TALL SAPLINGS THAT SHUT IT IN COMPLETELY THE GIRL
STOPPED AND TURNED

HERE WE ARE SHE SAID

HE WAS FACING HER AT SEVERAL PACES DISTANCE AS YET HE DID NOT DARE MOVE
NEARER TO HER

I DIDNT WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IN THE LANE SHE WENT ON IN CASE THERES
A MIKE HIDDEN THERE I DONT SUPPOSE THERE IS BUT THERE COULD BE THERES
ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF ONE OF THOSE SWINE RECOGNIZING YOUR VOICE WERE ALL
RIGHT HERE

HE STILL HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO APPROACH HER WERE ALL RIGHT HERE
HE REPEATED STUPIDLY

YES LOOK AT THE TREES THEY WERE SMALL ASHES WHICH AT SOME TIME HAD
BEEN CUT DOWN AND HAD SPROUTED UP AGAIN INTO A FOREST OF POLES NONE OF
THEM THICKER THAN ONES WRIST THERES NOTHING BIG ENOUGH TO HIDE A MIKE
IN BESIDES IVE BEEN HERE BEFORE

THEY WERE ONLY MAKING CONVERSATION HE HAD MANAGED TO MOVE CLOSER TO HER
NOW SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM VERY UPRIGHT WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE THAT
LOOKED FAINTLY IRONICAL AS THOUGH SHE WERE WONDERING WHY HE WAS SO SLOW
TO ACT THE BLUEBELLS HAD CASCADED ON TO THE GROUND THEY SEEMED TO HAVE
FALLEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD HE TOOK HER HAND

WOULD YOU BELIEVE HE SAID THAT TILL THIS MOMENT I DIDNT KNOW WHAT
COLOUR YOUR EYES WERE THEY WERE BROWN HE NOTED A RATHER LIGHT SHADE OF
BROWN WITH DARK LASHES NOW THAT YOUVE SEEN WHAT IM REALLY LIKE
CAN YOU STILL BEAR TO LOOK AT ME

YES EASILY

IM THIRTYNINE YEARS OLD IVE GOT A WIFE THAT I CANT GET RID OF IVE
GOT VARICOSE VEINS IVE GOT FIVE FALSE TEETH

I COULDNT CARE LESS SAID THE GIRL

THE NEXT MOMENT IT WAS HARD TO SAY BY WHOSE ACT SHE WAS IN HIS ARMS
AT THE BEGINNING HE HAD NO FEELING EXCEPT SHEER INCREDULITY THE YOUTHFUL
BODY WAS STRAINED AGAINST HIS OWN THE MASS OF DARK HAIR WAS AGAINST HIS
FACE AND YES ACTUALLY SHE HAD TURNED HER FACE UP AND HE WAS KISSING THE
WIDE RED MOUTH SHE HAD CLASPED HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK SHE WAS CALLING
HIM DARLING PRECIOUS ONE LOVED ONE HE HAD PULLED HER DOWN ON TO THE
GROUND SHE WAS UTTERLY UNRESISTING HE COULD DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH HER
BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE HAD NO PHYSICAL SENSATION EXCEPT THAT OF MERE
CONTACT ALL HE FELT WAS INCREDULITY AND PRIDE HE WAS GLAD THAT THIS WAS
HAPPENING BUT HE HAD NO PHYSICAL DESIRE IT WAS TOO SOON HER YOUTH AND
PRETTINESS HAD FRIGHTENED HIM HE WAS TOO MUCH USED TO LIVING WITHOUT
WOMENHE DID NOT KNOW THE REASON THE GIRL PICKED HERSELF UP AND PULLED A
BLUEBELL OUT OF HER HAIR SHE SAT AGAINST HIM PUTTING HER ARM ROUND HIS
WAIST

NEVER MIND DEAR THERES NO HURRY WEVE GOT THE WHOLE AFTERNOON ISNT
THIS A SPLENDID HIDEOUT I FOUND IT WHEN I GOT LOST ONCE ON A COMMUNITY
HIKE IF ANYONE WAS COMING YOU COULD HEAR THEM A HUNDRED METRES AWAY

WHAT IS YOUR NAME SAID WINSTON

JULIA I KNOW YOURS ITS WINSTONWINSTON SMITH

HOW DID YOU FIND THAT OUT

I EXPECT IM BETTER AT FINDING THINGS OUT THAN YOU ARE DEAR TELL ME
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME BEFORE THAT DAY I GAVE YOU THE NOTE

HE DID NOT FEEL ANY TEMPTATION TO TELL LIES TO HER IT WAS EVEN A SORT OF
LOVEOFFERING TO START OFF BY TELLING THE WORST

I HATED THE SIGHT OF YOU HE SAID I WANTED TO RAPE YOU AND THEN MURDER
YOU AFTERWARDS TWO WEEKS AGO I THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF SMASHING YOUR HEAD IN
WITH A COBBLESTONE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW I IMAGINED THAT YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE THOUGHT POLICE

THE GIRL LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY EVIDENTLY TAKING THIS AS A
TRIBUTE TO THE EXCELLENCE OF HER DISGUISE

NOT THE THOUGHT POLICE YOU DIDNT HONESTLY THINK THAT

WELL PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY THAT BUT FROM YOUR GENERAL APPEARANCEMERELY
BECAUSE YOURE YOUNG AND FRESH AND HEALTHY YOU UNDERSTANDI THOUGHT THAT
PROBABLY

YOU THOUGHT I WAS A GOOD PARTY MEMBER PURE IN WORD AND DEED BANNERS
PROCESSIONS SLOGANS GAMES COMMUNITY HIKES ALL THAT STUFF AND YOU
THOUGHT THAT IF I HAD A QUARTER OF A CHANCE ID DENOUNCE YOU AS A
THOUGHTCRIMINAL AND GET YOU KILLED OFF

YES SOMETHING OF THAT KIND A GREAT MANY YOUNG GIRLS ARE LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW

ITS THIS BLOODY THING THAT DOES IT SHE SAID RIPPING OFF THE SCARLET
SASH OF THE JUNIOR ANTISEX LEAGUE AND FLINGING IT ON TO A BOUGH THEN
AS THOUGH TOUCHING HER WAIST HAD REMINDED HER OF SOMETHING SHE FELT IN
THE POCKET OF HER OVERALLS AND PRODUCED A SMALL SLAB OF CHOCOLATE SHE
BROKE IT IN HALF AND GAVE ONE OF THE PIECES TO WINSTON EVEN BEFORE HE HAD
TAKEN IT HE KNEW BY THE SMELL THAT IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL CHOCOLATE IT WAS
DARK AND SHINY AND WAS WRAPPED IN SILVER PAPER CHOCOLATE NORMALLY WAS
DULLBROWN CRUMBLY STUFF THAT TASTED AS NEARLY AS ONE COULD DESCRIBE IT
LIKE THE SMOKE OF A RUBBISH FIRE BUT AT SOME TIME OR ANOTHER HE HAD TASTED
CHOCOLATE LIKE THE PIECE SHE HAD GIVEN HIM THE FIRST WHIFF OF ITS SCENT
HAD STIRRED UP SOME MEMORY WHICH HE COULD NOT PIN DOWN BUT WHICH WAS
POWERFUL AND TROUBLING

WHERE DID YOU GET THIS STUFF HE SAID

BLACK MARKET SHE SAID INDIFFERENTLY ACTUALLY I AM THAT SORT OF GIRL
TO LOOK AT IM GOOD AT GAMES I WAS A TROOPLEADER IN THE SPIES I DO
VOLUNTARY WORK THREE EVENINGS A WEEK FOR THE JUNIOR ANTISEX LEAGUE HOURS
AND HOURS IVE SPENT PASTING THEIR BLOODY ROT ALL OVER LONDON I ALWAYS
CARRY ONE END OF A BANNER IN THE PROCESSIONS I ALWAYS LOOK CHEERFUL AND
I NEVER SHIRK ANYTHING ALWAYS YELL WITH THE CROWD THATS WHAT I SAY
ITS THE ONLY WAY TO BE SAFE

THE FIRST FRAGMENT OF CHOCOLATE HAD MELTED ON WINSTONS TONGUE THE TASTE
WAS DELIGHTFUL BUT THERE WAS STILL THAT MEMORY MOVING ROUND THE EDGES OF
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS SOMETHING STRONGLY FELT BUT NOT REDUCIBLE TO DEFINITE
SHAPE LIKE AN OBJECT SEEN OUT OF THE CORNER OF ONES EYE HE PUSHED IT
AWAY FROM HIM AWARE ONLY THAT IT WAS THE MEMORY OF SOME ACTION WHICH HE
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO UNDO BUT COULD NOT

YOU ARE VERY YOUNG HE SAID YOU ARE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN
I AM WHAT COULD YOU SEE TO ATTRACT YOU IN A MAN LIKE ME

IT WAS SOMETHING IN YOUR FACE I THOUGHT ID TAKE A CHANCE IM GOOD AT
SPOTTING PEOPLE WHO DONT BELONG AS SOON AS I SAW YOU I KNEW YOU WERE
AGAINST THEM

THEM IT APPEARED MEANT THE PARTY AND ABOVE ALL THE INNER PARTY ABOUT
WHOM SHE TALKED WITH AN OPEN JEERING HATRED WHICH MADE WINSTON FEEL UNEASY
ALTHOUGH HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE SAFE HERE IF THEY COULD BE SAFE ANYWHERE
A THING THAT ASTONISHED HIM ABOUT HER WAS THE COARSENESS OF HER LANGUAGE
PARTY MEMBERS WERE SUPPOSED NOT TO SWEAR AND WINSTON HIMSELF VERY SELDOM
DID SWEAR ALOUD AT ANY RATE JULIA HOWEVER SEEMED UNABLE TO MENTION
THE PARTY AND ESPECIALLY THE INNER PARTY WITHOUT USING THE KIND OF WORDS
THAT YOU SAW CHALKED UP IN DRIPPING ALLEYWAYS HE DID NOT DISLIKE IT IT
WAS MERELY ONE SYMPTOM OF HER REVOLT AGAINST THE PARTY AND ALL ITS WAYS
AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED NATURAL AND HEALTHY LIKE THE SNEEZE OF A HORSE THAT
SMELLS BAD HAY THEY HAD LEFT THE CLEARING AND WERE WANDERING AGAIN
THROUGH THE CHEQUERED SHADE WITH THEIR ARMS ROUND EACH OTHERS WAISTS
WHENEVER IT WAS WIDE ENOUGH TO WALK TWO ABREAST HE NOTICED HOW MUCH
SOFTER HER WAIST SEEMED TO FEEL NOW THAT THE SASH WAS GONE THEY DID NOT
SPEAK ABOVE A WHISPER OUTSIDE THE CLEARING JULIA SAID IT WAS BETTER TO
GO QUIETLY PRESENTLY THEY HAD REACHED THE EDGE OF THE LITTLE WOOD SHE
STOPPED HIM

DONT GO OUT INTO THE OPEN THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE WATCHING WERE ALL
RIGHT IF WE KEEP BEHIND THE BOUGHS

THEY WERE STANDING IN THE SHADE OF HAZEL BUSHES THE SUNLIGHT FILTERING
THROUGH INNUMERABLE LEAVES WAS STILL HOT ON THEIR FACES WINSTON LOOKED
OUT INTO THE FIELD BEYOND AND UNDERWENT A CURIOUS SLOW SHOCK OF
RECOGNITION HE KNEW IT BY SIGHT AN OLD CLOSEBITTEN PASTURE WITH A
FOOTPATH WANDERING ACROSS IT AND A MOLEHILL HERE AND THERE IN THE RAGGED
HEDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE BOUGHS OF THE ELM TREES SWAYED JUST
PERCEPTIBLY IN THE BREEZE AND THEIR LEAVES STIRRED FAINTLY IN DENSE
MASSES LIKE WOMENS HAIR SURELY SOMEWHERE NEARBY BUT OUT OF SIGHT
THERE MUST BE A STREAM WITH GREEN POOLS WHERE DACE WERE SWIMMING

ISNT THERE A STREAM SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE HE WHISPERED

THATS RIGHT THERE IS A STREAM ITS AT THE EDGE OF THE NEXT FIELD
ACTUALLY THERE ARE FISH IN IT GREAT BIG ONES YOU CAN WATCH THEM LYING
IN THE POOLS UNDER THE WILLOW TREES WAVING THEIR TAILS

ITS THE GOLDEN COUNTRYALMOST HE MURMURED

THE GOLDEN COUNTRY

ITS NOTHING REALLY A LANDSCAPE IVE SEEN SOMETIMES IN A DREAM

LOOK WHISPERED JULIA

A THRUSH HAD ALIGHTED ON A BOUGH NOT FIVE METRES AWAY ALMOST AT THE LEVEL
OF THEIR FACES PERHAPS IT HAD NOT SEEN THEM IT WAS IN THE SUN THEY IN
THE SHADE IT SPREAD OUT ITS WINGS FITTED THEM CAREFULLY INTO PLACE
AGAIN DUCKED ITS HEAD FOR A MOMENT AS THOUGH MAKING A SORT OF OBEISANCE
TO THE SUN AND THEN BEGAN TO POUR FORTH A TORRENT OF SONG IN THE
AFTERNOON HUSH THE VOLUME OF SOUND WAS STARTLING WINSTON AND JULIA CLUNG
TOGETHER FASCINATED THE MUSIC WENT ON AND ON MINUTE AFTER MINUTE WITH
ASTONISHING VARIATIONS NEVER ONCE REPEATING ITSELF ALMOST AS THOUGH THE
BIRD WERE DELIBERATELY SHOWING OFF ITS VIRTUOSITY SOMETIMES IT STOPPED
FOR A FEW SECONDS SPREAD OUT AND RESETTLED ITS WINGS THEN SWELLED ITS
SPECKLED BREAST AND AGAIN BURST INTO SONG WINSTON WATCHED IT WITH A SORT
OF VAGUE REVERENCE FOR WHOM FOR WHAT WAS THAT BIRD SINGING NO MATE
NO RIVAL WAS WATCHING IT WHAT MADE IT SIT AT THE EDGE OF THE LONELY WOOD
AND POUR ITS MUSIC INTO NOTHINGNESS HE WONDERED WHETHER AFTER ALL THERE
WAS A MICROPHONE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE NEAR HE AND JULIA HAD SPOKEN ONLY IN
LOW WHISPERS AND IT WOULD NOT PICK UP WHAT THEY HAD SAID BUT IT WOULD
PICK UP THE THRUSH PERHAPS AT THE OTHER END OF THE INSTRUMENT SOME SMALL
BEETLELIKE MAN WAS LISTENING INTENTLYLISTENING TO THAT BUT BY DEGREES
THE FLOOD OF MUSIC DROVE ALL SPECULATIONS OUT OF HIS MIND IT WAS AS
THOUGH IT WERE A KIND OF LIQUID STUFF THAT POURED ALL OVER HIM AND GOT
MIXED UP WITH THE SUNLIGHT THAT FILTERED THROUGH THE LEAVES HE STOPPED
THINKING AND MERELY FELT THE GIRLS WAIST IN THE BEND OF HIS ARM WAS SOFT
AND WARM HE PULLED HER ROUND SO THAT THEY WERE BREAST TO BREAST HER BODY
SEEMED TO MELT INTO HIS WHEREVER HIS HANDS MOVED IT WAS ALL AS YIELDING AS
WATER THEIR MOUTHS CLUNG TOGETHER IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE HARD
KISSES THEY HAD EXCHANGED EARLIER WHEN THEY MOVED THEIR FACES APART AGAIN
BOTH OF THEM SIGHED DEEPLY THE BIRD TOOK FRIGHT AND FLED WITH A CLATTER
OF WINGS

WINSTON PUT HIS LIPS AGAINST HER EAR NOW HE WHISPERED

NOT HERE SHE WHISPERED BACK COME BACK TO THE HIDEOUT ITS SAFER

QUICKLY WITH AN OCCASIONAL CRACKLE OF TWIGS THEY THREADED THEIR WAY BACK
TO THE CLEARING WHEN THEY WERE ONCE INSIDE THE RING OF SAPLINGS SHE TURNED
AND FACED HIM THEY WERE BOTH BREATHING FAST BUT THE SMILE HAD REAPPEARED
ROUND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE STOOD LOOKING AT HIM FOR AN INSTANT
THEN FELT AT THE ZIPPER OF HER OVERALLS AND YES IT WAS ALMOST AS IN HIS
DREAM ALMOST AS SWIFTLY AS HE HAD IMAGINED IT SHE HAD TORN HER CLOTHES
OFF AND WHEN SHE FLUNG THEM ASIDE IT WAS WITH THAT SAME MAGNIFICENT
GESTURE BY WHICH A WHOLE CIVILIZATION SEEMED TO BE ANNIHILATED HER BODY
GLEAMED WHITE IN THE SUN BUT FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT LOOK AT HER BODY
HIS EYES WERE ANCHORED BY THE FRECKLED FACE WITH ITS FAINT BOLD SMILE
HE KNELT DOWN BEFORE HER AND TOOK HER HANDS IN HIS

HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE

OF COURSE HUNDREDS OF TIMESWELL SCORES OF TIMES ANYWAY

WITH PARTY MEMBERS

YES ALWAYS WITH PARTY MEMBERS

WITH MEMBERS OF THE INNER PARTY

NOT WITH THOSE SWINE NO BUT THERES PLENTY THAT WOULD IF THEY GOT HALF
A CHANCE THEYRE NOT SO HOLY AS THEY MAKE OUT

HIS HEART LEAPT SCORES OF TIMES SHE HAD DONE IT HE WISHED IT HAD BEEN
HUNDREDSTHOUSANDS ANYTHING THAT HINTED AT CORRUPTION ALWAYS FILLED HIM
WITH A WILD HOPE WHO KNEW PERHAPS THE PARTY WAS ROTTEN UNDER THE SURFACE
ITS CULT OF STRENUOUSNESS AND SELFDENIAL SIMPLY A SHAM CONCEALING
INIQUITY IF HE COULD HAVE INFECTED THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM WITH LEPROSY OR
SYPHILIS HOW GLADLY HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO ANYTHING TO ROT TO WEAKEN TO
UNDERMINE HE PULLED HER DOWN SO THAT THEY WERE KNEELING FACE TO FACE

LISTEN THE MORE MEN YOUVE HAD THE MORE I LOVE YOU DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT

YES PERFECTLY

I HATE PURITY I HATE GOODNESS I DONT WANT ANY VIRTUE TO EXIST ANYWHERE
I WANT EVERYONE TO BE CORRUPT TO THE BONES

WELL THEN I OUGHT TO SUIT YOU DEAR IM CORRUPT TO THE BONES

YOU LIKE DOING THIS I DONT MEAN SIMPLY ME I MEAN THE THING IN ITSELF

I ADORE IT

THAT WAS ABOVE ALL WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR NOT MERELY THE LOVE OF ONE
PERSON BUT THE ANIMAL INSTINCT THE SIMPLE UNDIFFERENTIATED DESIRE THAT
WAS THE FORCE THAT WOULD TEAR THE PARTY TO PIECES HE PRESSED HER DOWN
UPON THE GRASS AMONG THE FALLEN BLUEBELLS THIS TIME THERE WAS NO
DIFFICULTY PRESENTLY THE RISING AND FALLING OF THEIR BREASTS SLOWED TO
NORMAL SPEED AND IN A SORT OF PLEASANT HELPLESSNESS THEY FELL APART THE
SUN SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN HOTTER THEY WERE BOTH SLEEPY HE REACHED OUT FOR
THE DISCARDED OVERALLS AND PULLED THEM PARTLY OVER HER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
THEY FELL ASLEEP AND SLEPT FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR

WINSTON WOKE FIRST HE SAT UP AND WATCHED THE FRECKLED FACE STILL
PEACEFULLY ASLEEP PILLOWED ON THE PALM OF HER HAND EXCEPT FOR HER MOUTH
YOU COULD NOT CALL HER BEAUTIFUL THERE WAS A LINE OR TWO ROUND THE EYES
IF YOU LOOKED CLOSELY THE SHORT DARK HAIR WAS EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND
SOFT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE STILL DID NOT KNOW HER SURNAME OR WHERE
SHE LIVED

THE YOUNG STRONG BODY NOW HELPLESS IN SLEEP AWOKE IN HIM A PITYING
PROTECTING FEELING BUT THE MINDLESS TENDERNESS THAT HE HAD FELT UNDER
THE HAZEL TREE WHILE THE THRUSH WAS SINGING HAD NOT QUITE COME BACK
HE PULLED THE OVERALLS ASIDE AND STUDIED HER SMOOTH WHITE FLANK IN THE
OLD DAYS HE THOUGHT A MAN LOOKED AT A GIRLS BODY AND SAW THAT IT WAS
DESIRABLE AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE STORY BUT YOU COULD NOT HAVE PURE
LOVE OR PURE LUST NOWADAYS NO EMOTION WAS PURE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS
MIXED UP WITH FEAR AND HATRED THEIR EMBRACE HAD BEEN A BATTLE THE CLIMAX
A VICTORY IT WAS A BLOW STRUCK AGAINST THE PARTY IT WAS A POLITICAL ACT




CHAPTER 3



WE CAN COME HERE ONCE AGAIN SAID JULIA ITS GENERALLY SAFE TO USE ANY
HIDEOUT TWICE BUT NOT FOR ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO OF COURSE

AS SOON AS SHE WOKE UP HER DEMEANOUR HAD CHANGED SHE BECAME ALERT AND
BUSINESSLIKE PUT HER CLOTHES ON KNOTTED THE SCARLET SASH ABOUT HER
WAIST AND BEGAN ARRANGING THE DETAILS OF THE JOURNEY HOME IT SEEMED
NATURAL TO LEAVE THIS TO HER SHE OBVIOUSLY HAD A PRACTICAL CUNNING WHICH
WINSTON LACKED AND SHE SEEMED ALSO TO HAVE AN EXHAUSTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
COUNTRYSIDE ROUND LONDON STORED AWAY FROM INNUMERABLE COMMUNITY HIKES
THE ROUTE SHE GAVE HIM WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE BY WHICH HE HAD
COME AND BROUGHT HIM OUT AT A DIFFERENT RAILWAY STATION NEVER GO HOME
THE SAME WAY AS YOU WENT OUT SHE SAID AS THOUGH ENUNCIATING AN IMPORTANT
GENERAL PRINCIPLE SHE WOULD LEAVE FIRST AND WINSTON WAS TO WAIT HALF AN
HOUR BEFORE FOLLOWING HER

SHE HAD NAMED A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD MEET AFTER WORK FOUR EVENINGS
HENCE IT WAS A STREET IN ONE OF THE POORER QUARTERS WHERE THERE WAS AN
OPEN MARKET WHICH WAS GENERALLY CROWDED AND NOISY SHE WOULD BE HANGING
ABOUT AMONG THE STALLS PRETENDING TO BE IN SEARCH OF SHOELACES OR
SEWINGTHREAD IF SHE JUDGED THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR SHE WOULD BLOW
HER NOSE WHEN HE APPROACHED OTHERWISE HE WAS TO WALK PAST HER WITHOUT
RECOGNITION BUT WITH LUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD IT WOULD BE
SAFE TO TALK FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND ARRANGE ANOTHER MEETING

AND NOW I MUST GO SHE SAID AS SOON AS HE HAD MASTERED HIS INSTRUCTIONS
IM DUE BACK AT NINETEENTHIRTY IVE GOT TO PUT IN TWO HOURS FOR THE
JUNIOR ANTISEX LEAGUE HANDING OUT LEAFLETS OR SOMETHING ISNT IT
BLOODY GIVE ME A BRUSHDOWN WOULD YOU HAVE I GOT ANY TWIGS IN MY HAIR
ARE YOU SURE THEN GOODBYE MY LOVE GOODBYE

SHE FLUNG HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS KISSED HIM ALMOST VIOLENTLY AND A MOMENT
LATER PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE SAPLINGS AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE WOOD
WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE EVEN NOW HE HAD NOT FOUND OUT HER SURNAME OR HER
ADDRESS HOWEVER IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE FOR IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT
THEY COULD EVER MEET INDOORS OR EXCHANGE ANY KIND OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

AS IT HAPPENED THEY NEVER WENT BACK TO THE CLEARING IN THE WOOD DURING
THE MONTH OF MAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE FURTHER OCCASION ON WHICH THEY ACTUALLY
SUCCEEDED IN MAKING LOVE THAT WAS IN ANOTHER HIDINGPLACE KNOWN TO JULIA
THE BELFRY OF A RUINOUS CHURCH IN AN ALMOSTDESERTED STRETCH OF COUNTRY
WHERE AN ATOMIC BOMB HAD FALLEN THIRTY YEARS EARLIER IT WAS A GOOD
HIDINGPLACE WHEN ONCE YOU GOT THERE BUT THE GETTING THERE WAS VERY
DANGEROUS FOR THE REST THEY COULD MEET ONLY IN THE STREETS IN A DIFFERENT
PLACE EVERY EVENING AND NEVER FOR MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME IN THE
STREET IT WAS USUALLY POSSIBLE TO TALK AFTER A FASHION AS THEY DRIFTED
DOWN THE CROWDED PAVEMENTS NOT QUITE ABREAST AND NEVER LOOKING AT ONE
ANOTHER THEY CARRIED ON A CURIOUS INTERMITTENT CONVERSATION WHICH FLICKED
ON AND OFF LIKE THE BEAMS OF A LIGHTHOUSE SUDDENLY NIPPED INTO SILENCE
BY THE APPROACH OF A PARTY UNIFORM OR THE PROXIMITY OF A TELESCREEN THEN
TAKEN UP AGAIN MINUTES LATER IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE THEN ABRUPTLY
CUT SHORT AS THEY PARTED AT THE AGREED SPOT THEN CONTINUED ALMOST WITHOUT
INTRODUCTION ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JULIA APPEARED TO BE QUITE USED TO THIS
KIND OF CONVERSATION WHICH SHE CALLED TALKING BY INSTALMENTS SHE WAS
ALSO SURPRISINGLY ADEPT AT SPEAKING WITHOUT MOVING HER LIPS JUST ONCE IN
ALMOST A MONTH OF NIGHTLY MEETINGS THEY MANAGED TO EXCHANGE A KISS THEY
WERE PASSING IN SILENCE DOWN A SIDESTREET JULIA WOULD NEVER SPEAK WHEN
THEY WERE AWAY FROM THE MAIN STREETS WHEN THERE WAS A DEAFENING ROAR THE
EARTH HEAVED AND THE AIR DARKENED AND WINSTON FOUND HIMSELF LYING ON HIS
SIDE BRUISED AND TERRIFIED A ROCKET BOMB MUST HAVE DROPPED QUITE NEAR AT
HAND SUDDENLY HE BECAME AWARE OF JULIAS FACE A FEW CENTIMETRES FROM HIS
OWN DEATHLY WHITE AS WHITE AS CHALK EVEN HER LIPS WERE WHITE SHE WAS
DEAD HE CLASPED HER AGAINST HIM AND FOUND THAT HE WAS KISSING A LIVE
WARM FACE BUT THERE WAS SOME POWDERY STUFF THAT GOT IN THE WAY OF HIS
LIPS BOTH OF THEIR FACES WERE THICKLY COATED WITH PLASTER

THERE WERE EVENINGS WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR RENDEZVOUS AND THEN HAD TO
WALK PAST ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT A SIGN BECAUSE A PATROL HAD JUST COME ROUND
THE CORNER OR A HELICOPTER WAS HOVERING OVERHEAD EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN
LESS DANGEROUS IT WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND TIME TO MEET
WINSTONS WORKING WEEK WAS SIXTY HOURS JULIAS WAS EVEN LONGER AND
THEIR FREE DAYS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE PRESSURE OF WORK AND DID NOT
OFTEN COINCIDE JULIA IN ANY CASE SELDOM HAD AN EVENING COMPLETELY FREE
SHE SPENT AN ASTONISHING AMOUNT OF TIME IN ATTENDING LECTURES AND
DEMONSTRATIONS DISTRIBUTING LITERATURE FOR THE JUNIOR ANTISEX LEAGUE
PREPARING BANNERS FOR HATE WEEK MAKING COLLECTIONS FOR THE SAVINGS
CAMPAIGN AND SUCHLIKE ACTIVITIES IT PAID SHE SAID IT WAS CAMOUFLAGE
IF YOU KEPT THE SMALL RULES YOU COULD BREAK THE BIG ONES SHE EVEN INDUCED
WINSTON TO MORTGAGE YET ANOTHER OF HIS EVENINGS BY ENROLLING HIMSELF FOR
THE PARTTIME MUNITION WORK WHICH WAS DONE VOLUNTARILY BY ZEALOUS PARTY
MEMBERS SO ONE EVENING EVERY WEEK WINSTON SPENT FOUR HOURS OF PARALYSING
BOREDOM SCREWING TOGETHER SMALL BITS OF METAL WHICH WERE PROBABLY PARTS
OF BOMB FUSES IN A DRAUGHTY ILLLIT WORKSHOP WHERE THE KNOCKING OF
HAMMERS MINGLED DREARILY WITH THE MUSIC OF THE TELESCREENS

WHEN THEY MET IN THE CHURCH TOWER THE GAPS IN THEIR FRAGMENTARY
CONVERSATION WERE FILLED UP IT WAS A BLAZING AFTERNOON THE AIR IN THE
LITTLE SQUARE CHAMBER ABOVE THE BELLS WAS HOT AND STAGNANT AND SMELT
OVERPOWERINGLY OF PIGEON DUNG THEY SAT TALKING FOR HOURS ON THE DUSTY
TWIGLITTERED FLOOR ONE OR OTHER OF THEM GETTING UP FROM TIME TO TIME TO
CAST A GLANCE THROUGH THE ARROWSLITS AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS COMING

JULIA WAS TWENTYSIX YEARS OLD SHE LIVED IN A HOSTEL WITH THIRTY OTHER
GIRLS ALWAYS IN THE STINK OF WOMEN HOW I HATE WOMEN SHE SAID
PARENTHETICALLY AND SHE WORKED AS HE HAD GUESSED ON THE NOVELWRITING
MACHINES IN THE FICTION DEPARTMENT SHE ENJOYED HER WORK WHICH CONSISTED
CHIEFLY IN RUNNING AND SERVICING A POWERFUL BUT TRICKY ELECTRIC MOTOR
SHE WAS NOT CLEVER BUT WAS FOND OF USING HER HANDS AND FELT AT HOME
WITH MACHINERY SHE COULD DESCRIBE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF COMPOSING A NOVEL
FROM THE GENERAL DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY THE PLANNING COMMITTEE DOWN TO THE
FINAL TOUCHINGUP BY THE REWRITE SQUAD BUT SHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE
FINISHED PRODUCT SHE DIDNT MUCH CARE FOR READING SHE SAID BOOKS WERE
JUST A COMMODITY THAT HAD TO BE PRODUCED LIKE JAM OR BOOTLACES

SHE HAD NO MEMORIES OF ANYTHING BEFORE THE EARLY SIXTIES AND THE ONLY
PERSON SHE HAD EVER KNOWN WHO TALKED FREQUENTLY OF THE DAYS BEFORE THE
REVOLUTION WAS A GRANDFATHER WHO HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT AT
SCHOOL SHE HAD BEEN CAPTAIN OF THE HOCKEY TEAM AND HAD WON THE GYMNASTICS
TROPHY TWO YEARS RUNNING SHE HAD BEEN A TROOPLEADER IN THE SPIES AND A
BRANCH SECRETARY IN THE YOUTH LEAGUE BEFORE JOINING THE JUNIOR ANTISEX
LEAGUE SHE HAD ALWAYS BORNE AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER SHE HAD EVEN AN
INFALLIBLE MARK OF GOOD REPUTATION BEEN PICKED OUT TO WORK IN PORNOSEC
THE SUBSECTION OF THE FICTION DEPARTMENT WHICH TURNED OUT CHEAP
PORNOGRAPHY FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE PROLES IT WAS NICKNAMED MUCK HOUSE
BY THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN IT SHE REMARKED THERE SHE HAD REMAINED FOR
A YEAR HELPING TO PRODUCE BOOKLETS IN SEALED PACKETS WITH TITLES LIKE
SPANKING STORIES OR ONE NIGHT IN A GIRLS SCHOOL TO BE BOUGHT
FURTIVELY BY PROLETARIAN YOUTHS WHO WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY
WERE BUYING SOMETHING ILLEGAL

WHAT ARE THESE BOOKS LIKE SAID WINSTON CURIOUSLY

OH GHASTLY RUBBISH THEYRE BORING REALLY THEY ONLY HAVE SIX PLOTS
BUT THEY SWAP THEM ROUND A BIT OF COURSE I WAS ONLY ON THE KALEIDOSCOPES
I WAS NEVER IN THE REWRITE SQUAD IM NOT LITERARY DEARNOT EVEN ENOUGH
FOR THAT

HE LEARNED WITH ASTONISHMENT THAT ALL THE WORKERS IN PORNOSEC EXCEPT THE
HEADS OF THE DEPARTMENTS WERE GIRLS THE THEORY WAS THAT MEN WHOSE SEX
INSTINCTS WERE LESS CONTROLLABLE THAN THOSE OF WOMEN WERE IN GREATER
DANGER OF BEING CORRUPTED BY THE FILTH THEY HANDLED

THEY DONT EVEN LIKE HAVING MARRIED WOMEN THERE SHE ADDED GIRLS ARE
ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE SO PURE HERES ONE WHO ISNT ANYWAY

SHE HAD HAD HER FIRST LOVEAFFAIR WHEN SHE WAS SIXTEEN WITH A PARTY MEMBER
OF SIXTY WHO LATER COMMITTED SUICIDE TO AVOID ARREST AND A GOOD JOB TOO
SAID JULIA OTHERWISE THEYD HAVE HAD MY NAME OUT OF HIM WHEN HE
CONFESSED SINCE THEN THERE HAD BEEN VARIOUS OTHERS LIFE AS SHE SAW IT
WAS QUITE SIMPLE YOU WANTED A GOOD TIME THEY MEANING THE PARTY
WANTED TO STOP YOU HAVING IT YOU BROKE THE RULES AS BEST YOU COULD SHE
SEEMED TO THINK IT JUST AS NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD WANT TO ROB YOU OF
YOUR PLEASURES AS THAT YOU SHOULD WANT TO AVOID BEING CAUGHT SHE HATED
THE PARTY AND SAID SO IN THE CRUDEST WORDS BUT SHE MADE NO GENERAL
CRITICISM OF IT EXCEPT WHERE IT TOUCHED UPON HER OWN LIFE SHE HAD NO
INTEREST IN PARTY DOCTRINE HE NOTICED THAT SHE NEVER USED NEWSPEAK WORDS
EXCEPT THE ONES THAT HAD PASSED INTO EVERYDAY USE SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF
THE BROTHERHOOD AND REFUSED TO BELIEVE IN ITS EXISTENCE ANY KIND OF
ORGANIZED REVOLT AGAINST THE PARTY WHICH WAS BOUND TO BE A FAILURE
STRUCK HER AS STUPID THE CLEVER THING WAS TO BREAK THE RULES AND STAY
ALIVE ALL THE SAME HE WONDERED VAGUELY HOW MANY OTHERS LIKE HER THERE
MIGHT BE IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION PEOPLE WHO HAD GROWN UP IN THE WORLD OF
THE REVOLUTION KNOWING NOTHING ELSE ACCEPTING THE PARTY AS SOMETHING
UNALTERABLE LIKE THE SKY NOT REBELLING AGAINST ITS AUTHORITY BUT SIMPLY
EVADING IT AS A RABBIT DODGES A DOG

THEY DID NOT DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING MARRIED IT WAS TOO REMOTE
TO BE WORTH THINKING ABOUT NO IMAGINABLE COMMITTEE WOULD EVER SANCTION
SUCH A MARRIAGE EVEN IF KATHARINE WINSTONS WIFE COULD SOMEHOW HAVE BEEN
GOT RID OF IT WAS HOPELESS EVEN AS A DAYDREAM

WHAT WAS SHE LIKE YOUR WIFE SAID JULIA

SHE WASDO YOU KNOW THE NEWSPEAK WORD GOODTHINKFUL MEANING NATURALLY
ORTHODOX INCAPABLE OF THINKING A BAD THOUGHT

NO I DIDNT KNOW THE WORD BUT I KNOW THE KIND OF PERSON RIGHT ENOUGH

HE BEGAN TELLING HER THE STORY OF HIS MARRIED LIFE BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH
SHE APPEARED TO KNOW THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF IT ALREADY SHE DESCRIBED
TO HIM ALMOST AS THOUGH SHE HAD SEEN OR FELT IT THE STIFFENING OF
KATHARINES BODY AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED HER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE STILL
SEEMED TO BE PUSHING HIM FROM HER WITH ALL HER STRENGTH EVEN WHEN HER
ARMS WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY ROUND HIM WITH JULIA HE FELT NO DIFFICULTY IN
TALKING ABOUT SUCH THINGS KATHARINE IN ANY CASE HAD LONG CEASED TO BE
A PAINFUL MEMORY AND BECAME MERELY A DISTASTEFUL ONE

I COULD HAVE STOOD IT IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR ONE THING HE SAID HE TOLD
HER ABOUT THE FRIGID LITTLE CEREMONY THAT KATHARINE HAD FORCED HIM TO GO
THROUGH ON THE SAME NIGHT EVERY WEEK SHE HATED IT BUT NOTHING WOULD
MAKE HER STOP DOING IT SHE USED TO CALL ITBUT YOULL NEVER GUESS

OUR DUTY TO THE PARTY SAID JULIA PROMPTLY

HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT

IVE BEEN AT SCHOOL TOO DEAR SEX TALKS ONCE A MONTH FOR THE
OVERSIXTEENS AND IN THE YOUTH MOVEMENT THEY RUB IT INTO YOU FOR YEARS
I DARE SAY IT WORKS IN A LOT OF CASES BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN NEVER TELL
PEOPLE ARE SUCH HYPOCRITES

SHE BEGAN TO ENLARGE UPON THE SUBJECT WITH JULIA EVERYTHING CAME BACK
TO HER OWN SEXUALITY AS SOON AS THIS WAS TOUCHED UPON IN ANY WAY SHE WAS
CAPABLE OF GREAT ACUTENESS UNLIKE WINSTON SHE HAD GRASPED THE INNER
MEANING OF THE PARTYS SEXUAL PURITANISM IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT THE SEX
INSTINCT CREATED A WORLD OF ITS OWN WHICH WAS OUTSIDE THE PARTYS CONTROL
AND WHICH THEREFORE HAD TO BE DESTROYED IF POSSIBLE WHAT WAS MORE
IMPORTANT WAS THAT SEXUAL PRIVATION INDUCED HYSTERIA WHICH WAS DESIRABLE
BECAUSE IT COULD BE TRANSFORMED INTO WARFEVER AND LEADERWORSHIP THE WAY
SHE PUT IT WAS

WHEN YOU MAKE LOVE YOURE USING UP ENERGY AND AFTERWARDS YOU FEEL HAPPY
AND DONT GIVE A DAMN FOR ANYTHING THEY CANT BEAR YOU TO FEEL LIKE THAT
THEY WANT YOU TO BE BURSTING WITH ENERGY ALL THE TIME ALL THIS MARCHING
UP AND DOWN AND CHEERING AND WAVING FLAGS IS SIMPLY SEX GONE SOUR IF
YOURE HAPPY INSIDE YOURSELF WHY SHOULD YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT BIG BROTHER
AND THE THREEYEAR PLANS AND THE TWO MINUTES HATE AND ALL THE REST OF
THEIR BLOODY ROT

THAT WAS VERY TRUE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A DIRECT INTIMATE CONNEXION
BETWEEN CHASTITY AND POLITICAL ORTHODOXY FOR HOW COULD THE FEAR THE
HATRED AND THE LUNATIC CREDULITY WHICH THE PARTY NEEDED IN ITS MEMBERS BE
KEPT AT THE RIGHT PITCH EXCEPT BY BOTTLING DOWN SOME POWERFUL INSTINCT
AND USING IT AS A DRIVING FORCE THE SEX IMPULSE WAS DANGEROUS TO THE
PARTY AND THE PARTY HAD TURNED IT TO ACCOUNT THEY HAD PLAYED A SIMILAR
TRICK WITH THE INSTINCT OF PARENTHOOD THE FAMILY COULD NOT ACTUALLY BE
ABOLISHED AND INDEED PEOPLE WERE ENCOURAGED TO BE FOND OF THEIR
CHILDREN IN ALMOST THE OLDFASHIONED WAY THE CHILDREN ON THE OTHER HAND
WERE SYSTEMATICALLY TURNED AGAINST THEIR PARENTS AND TAUGHT TO SPY ON THEM
AND REPORT THEIR DEVIATIONS THE FAMILY HAD BECOME IN EFFECT AN EXTENSION
OF THE THOUGHT POLICE IT WAS A DEVICE BY MEANS OF WHICH EVERYONE COULD BE
SURROUNDED NIGHT AND DAY BY INFORMERS WHO KNEW HIM INTIMATELY

ABRUPTLY HIS MIND WENT BACK TO KATHARINE KATHARINE WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY
HAVE DENOUNCED HIM TO THE THOUGHT POLICE IF SHE HAD NOT HAPPENED TO BE TOO
STUPID TO DETECT THE UNORTHODOXY OF HIS OPINIONS BUT WHAT REALLY RECALLED
HER TO HIM AT THIS MOMENT WAS THE STIFLING HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON WHICH
HAD BROUGHT THE SWEAT OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD HE BEGAN TELLING JULIA OF
SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED OR RATHER HAD FAILED TO HAPPEN ON ANOTHER
SWELTERING SUMMER AFTERNOON ELEVEN YEARS AGO

IT WAS THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED THEY HAD LOST THEIR
WAY ON A COMMUNITY HIKE SOMEWHERE IN KENT THEY HAD ONLY LAGGED BEHIND
THE OTHERS FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT THEY TOOK A WRONG TURNING AND
PRESENTLY FOUND THEMSELVES PULLED UP SHORT BY THE EDGE OF AN OLD CHALK
QUARRY IT WAS A SHEER DROP OF TEN OR TWENTY METRES WITH BOULDERS AT THE
BOTTOM THERE WAS NOBODY OF WHOM THEY COULD ASK THE WAY AS SOON AS SHE
REALIZED THAT THEY WERE LOST KATHARINE BECAME VERY UNEASY TO BE AWAY
FROM THE NOISY MOB OF HIKERS EVEN FOR A MOMENT GAVE HER A FEELING OF
WRONGDOING SHE WANTED TO HURRY BACK BY THE WAY THEY HAD COME AND START
SEARCHING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION BUT AT THIS MOMENT WINSTON NOTICED SOME
TUFTS OF LOOSESTRIFE GROWING IN THE CRACKS OF THE CLIFF BENEATH THEM
ONE TUFT WAS OF TWO COLOURS MAGENTA AND BRICKRED APPARENTLY GROWING ON
THE SAME ROOT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE KIND BEFORE AND HE CALLED
TO KATHARINE TO COME AND LOOK AT IT

LOOK KATHARINE LOOK AT THOSE FLOWERS THAT CLUMP DOWN NEAR THE BOTTOM
DO YOU SEE THEYRE TWO DIFFERENT COLOURS

SHE HAD ALREADY TURNED TO GO BUT SHE DID RATHER FRETFULLY COME BACK FOR
A MOMENT SHE EVEN LEANED OUT OVER THE CLIFF FACE TO SEE WHERE HE WAS
POINTING HE WAS STANDING A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND HE PUT HIS HAND ON
HER WAIST TO STEADY HER AT THIS MOMENT IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM HOW
COMPLETELY ALONE THEY WERE THERE WAS NOT A HUMAN CREATURE ANYWHERE NOT A
LEAF STIRRING NOT EVEN A BIRD AWAKE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS THE DANGER THAT
THERE WOULD BE A HIDDEN MICROPHONE WAS VERY SMALL AND EVEN IF THERE WAS A
MICROPHONE IT WOULD ONLY PICK UP SOUNDS IT WAS THE HOTTEST SLEEPIEST HOUR
OF THE AFTERNOON THE SUN BLAZED DOWN UPON THEM THE SWEAT TICKLED HIS
FACE AND THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM

WHY DIDNT YOU GIVE HER A GOOD SHOVE SAID JULIA I WOULD HAVE

YES DEAR YOU WOULD HAVE I WOULD IF ID BEEN THE SAME PERSON THEN AS
I AM NOW OR PERHAPS I WOULDIM NOT CERTAIN

ARE YOU SORRY YOU DIDNT

YES ON THE WHOLE IM SORRY I DIDNT

THEY WERE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DUSTY FLOOR HE PULLED HER CLOSER
AGAINST HIM HER HEAD RESTED ON HIS SHOULDER THE PLEASANT SMELL OF HER
HAIR CONQUERING THE PIGEON DUNG SHE WAS VERY YOUNG HE THOUGHT SHE
STILL EXPECTED SOMETHING FROM LIFE SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT TO PUSH
AN INCONVENIENT PERSON OVER A CLIFF SOLVES NOTHING

ACTUALLY IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE HE SAID

THEN WHY ARE YOU SORRY YOU DIDNT DO IT

ONLY BECAUSE I PREFER A POSITIVE TO A NEGATIVE IN THIS GAME THAT WERE
PLAYING WE CANT WIN SOME KINDS OF FAILURE ARE BETTER THAN OTHER KINDS
THATS ALL

HE FELT HER SHOULDERS GIVE A WRIGGLE OF DISSENT SHE ALWAYS CONTRADICTED
HIM WHEN HE SAID ANYTHING OF THIS KIND SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT AS A LAW
OF NATURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALWAYS DEFEATED IN A WAY SHE REALIZED
THAT SHE HERSELF WAS DOOMED THAT SOONER OR LATER THE THOUGHT POLICE WOULD
CATCH HER AND KILL HER BUT WITH ANOTHER PART OF HER MIND SHE BELIEVED
THAT IT WAS SOMEHOW POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A SECRET WORLD IN WHICH YOU COULD
LIVE AS YOU CHOSE ALL YOU NEEDED WAS LUCK AND CUNNING AND BOLDNESS SHE
DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS HAPPINESS THAT THE
ONLY VICTORY LAY IN THE FAR FUTURE LONG AFTER YOU WERE DEAD THAT FROM
THE MOMENT OF DECLARING WAR ON THE PARTY IT WAS BETTER TO THINK OF YOURSELF
AS A CORPSE

WE ARE THE DEAD HE SAID

WERE NOT DEAD YET SAID JULIA PROSAICALLY

NOT PHYSICALLY SIX MONTHS A YEARFIVE YEARS CONCEIVABLY I AM AFRAID
OF DEATH YOU ARE YOUNG SO PRESUMABLY YOURE MORE AFRAID OF IT THAN I AM
OBVIOUSLY WE SHALL PUT IT OFF AS LONG AS WE CAN BUT IT MAKES VERY LITTLE
DIFFERENCE SO LONG AS HUMAN BEINGS STAY HUMAN DEATH AND LIFE ARE THE
SAME THING

OH RUBBISH WHICH WOULD YOU SOONER SLEEP WITH ME OR A SKELETON DONT
YOU ENJOY BEING ALIVE DONT YOU LIKE FEELING THIS IS ME THIS IS MY HAND
THIS IS MY LEG IM REAL IM SOLID IM ALIVE DONT YOU LIKE THIS

SHE TWISTED HERSELF ROUND AND PRESSED HER BOSOM AGAINST HIM HE COULD FEEL
HER BREASTS RIPE YET FIRM THROUGH HER OVERALLS HER BODY SEEMED TO BE
POURING SOME OF ITS YOUTH AND VIGOUR INTO HIS

YES I LIKE THAT HE SAID

THEN STOP TALKING ABOUT DYING AND NOW LISTEN DEAR WEVE GOT TO FIX
UP ABOUT THE NEXT TIME WE MEET WE MAY AS WELL GO BACK TO THE PLACE IN
THE WOOD WEVE GIVEN IT A GOOD LONG REST BUT YOU MUST GET THERE BY A
DIFFERENT WAY THIS TIME IVE GOT IT ALL PLANNED OUT YOU TAKE THE
TRAINBUT LOOK ILL DRAW IT OUT FOR YOU

AND IN HER PRACTICAL WAY SHE SCRAPED TOGETHER A SMALL SQUARE OF DUST
AND WITH A TWIG FROM A PIGEONS NEST BEGAN DRAWING A MAP ON THE FLOOR




CHAPTER 4



WINSTON LOOKED ROUND THE SHABBY LITTLE ROOM ABOVE MR CHARRINGTONS SHOP
BESIDE THE WINDOW THE ENORMOUS BED WAS MADE UP WITH RAGGED BLANKETS AND
A COVERLESS BOLSTER THE OLDFASHIONED CLOCK WITH THE TWELVEHOUR FACE WAS
TICKING AWAY ON THE MANTELPIECE IN THE CORNER ON THE GATELEG TABLE THE
GLASS PAPERWEIGHT WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT ON HIS LAST VISIT GLEAMED SOFTLY OUT
OF THE HALFDARKNESS

IN THE FENDER WAS A BATTERED TIN OILSTOVE A SAUCEPAN AND TWO CUPS
PROVIDED BY MR CHARRINGTON WINSTON LIT THE BURNER AND SET A PAN OF WATER
TO BOIL HE HAD BROUGHT AN ENVELOPE FULL OF VICTORY COFFEE AND SOME
SACCHARINE TABLETS THE CLOCKS HANDS SAID SEVENTEENTWENTY IT WAS
NINETEENTWENTY REALLY SHE WAS COMING AT NINETEENTHIRTY

FOLLY FOLLY HIS HEART KEPT SAYING CONSCIOUS GRATUITOUS SUICIDAL FOLLY
OF ALL THE CRIMES THAT A PARTY MEMBER COULD COMMIT THIS ONE WAS THE LEAST
POSSIBLE TO CONCEAL ACTUALLY THE IDEA HAD FIRST FLOATED INTO HIS HEAD IN
THE FORM OF A VISION OF THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT MIRRORED BY THE SURFACE
OF THE GATELEG TABLE AS HE HAD FORESEEN MR CHARRINGTON HAD MADE NO
DIFFICULTY ABOUT LETTING THE ROOM HE WAS OBVIOUSLY GLAD OF THE FEW DOLLARS
THAT IT WOULD BRING HIM NOR DID HE SEEM SHOCKED OR BECOME OFFENSIVELY
KNOWING WHEN IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT WINSTON WANTED THE ROOM FOR THE PURPOSE
OF A LOVEAFFAIR INSTEAD HE LOOKED INTO THE MIDDLE DISTANCE AND SPOKE IN
GENERALITIES WITH SO DELICATE AN AIR AS TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE
HAD BECOME PARTLY INVISIBLE PRIVACY HE SAID WAS A VERY VALUABLE THING
EVERYONE WANTED A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD BE ALONE OCCASIONALLY AND WHEN
THEY HAD SUCH A PLACE IT WAS ONLY COMMON COURTESY IN ANYONE ELSE WHO KNEW
OF IT TO KEEP HIS KNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF HE EVEN SEEMING ALMOST TO FADE
OUT OF EXISTENCE AS HE DID SO ADDED THAT THERE WERE TWO ENTRIES TO THE
HOUSE ONE OF THEM THROUGH THE BACK YARD WHICH GAVE ON AN ALLEY

UNDER THE WINDOW SOMEBODY WAS SINGING WINSTON PEEPED OUT SECURE IN THE
PROTECTION OF THE MUSLIN CURTAIN THE JUNE SUN WAS STILL HIGH IN THE SKY
AND IN THE SUNFILLED COURT BELOW A MONSTROUS WOMAN SOLID AS A NORMAN
PILLAR WITH BRAWNY RED FOREARMS AND A SACKING APRON STRAPPED ABOUT HER
MIDDLE WAS STUMPING TO AND FRO BETWEEN A WASHTUB AND A CLOTHES LINE
PEGGING OUT A SERIES OF SQUARE WHITE THINGS WHICH WINSTON RECOGNIZED AS
BABIES DIAPERS WHENEVER HER MOUTH WAS NOT CORKED WITH CLOTHES PEGS SHE
WAS SINGING IN A POWERFUL CONTRALTO


IT WAS ONLY AN OPELESS FANCY
IT PASSED LIKE AN IPRIL DYE
BUT A LOOK AN A WORD AN THE DREAMS THEY STIRRED
THEY AVE STOLEN MY EART AWYE


THE TUNE HAD BEEN HAUNTING LONDON FOR WEEKS PAST IT WAS ONE OF COUNTLESS
SIMILAR SONGS PUBLISHED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PROLES BY A SUBSECTION OF
THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT THE WORDS OF THESE SONGS WERE COMPOSED WITHOUT ANY
HUMAN INTERVENTION WHATEVER ON AN INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS A VERSIFICATOR
BUT THE WOMAN SANG SO TUNEFULLY AS TO TURN THE DREADFUL RUBBISH INTO AN
ALMOST PLEASANT SOUND HE COULD HEAR THE WOMAN SINGING AND THE SCRAPE OF
HER SHOES ON THE FLAGSTONES AND THE CRIES OF THE CHILDREN IN THE STREET
AND SOMEWHERE IN THE FAR DISTANCE A FAINT ROAR OF TRAFFIC AND YET THE
ROOM SEEMED CURIOUSLY SILENT THANKS TO THE ABSENCE OF A TELESCREEN

FOLLY FOLLY FOLLY HE THOUGHT AGAIN IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THEY COULD
FREQUENT THIS PLACE FOR MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT BUT
THE TEMPTATION OF HAVING A HIDINGPLACE THAT WAS TRULY THEIR OWN INDOORS
AND NEAR AT HAND HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR BOTH OF THEM FOR SOME TIME
AFTER THEIR VISIT TO THE CHURCH BELFRY IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRANGE
MEETINGS WORKING HOURS HAD BEEN DRASTICALLY INCREASED IN ANTICIPATION OF
HATE WEEK IT WAS MORE THAN A MONTH DISTANT BUT THE ENORMOUS COMPLEX
PREPARATIONS THAT IT ENTAILED WERE THROWING EXTRA WORK ON TO EVERYBODY
FINALLY BOTH OF THEM MANAGED TO SECURE A FREE AFTERNOON ON THE SAME DAY
THEY HAD AGREED TO GO BACK TO THE CLEARING IN THE WOOD ON THE EVENING
BEFOREHAND THEY MET BRIEFLY IN THE STREET AS USUAL WINSTON HARDLY LOOKED
AT JULIA AS THEY DRIFTED TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER IN THE CROWD BUT FROM THE
SHORT GLANCE HE GAVE HER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS PALER THAN USUAL

ITS ALL OFF SHE MURMURED AS SOON AS SHE JUDGED IT SAFE TO SPEAK
TOMORROW I MEAN

WHAT

TOMORROW AFTERNOON I CANT COME

WHY NOT

OH THE USUAL REASON ITS STARTED EARLY THIS TIME

FOR A MOMENT HE WAS VIOLENTLY ANGRY DURING THE MONTH THAT HE HAD KNOWN
HER THE NATURE OF HIS DESIRE FOR HER HAD CHANGED AT THE BEGINNING THERE
HAD BEEN LITTLE TRUE SENSUALITY IN IT THEIR FIRST LOVEMAKING HAD BEEN
SIMPLY AN ACT OF THE WILL BUT AFTER THE SECOND TIME IT WAS DIFFERENT THE
SMELL OF HER HAIR THE TASTE OF HER MOUTH THE FEELING OF HER SKIN SEEMED
TO HAVE GOT INSIDE HIM OR INTO THE AIR ALL ROUND HIM SHE HAD BECOME A
PHYSICAL NECESSITY SOMETHING THAT HE NOT ONLY WANTED BUT FELT THAT HE
HAD A RIGHT TO WHEN SHE SAID THAT SHE COULD NOT COME HE HAD THE FEELING
THAT SHE WAS CHEATING HIM BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE CROWD PRESSED
THEM TOGETHER AND THEIR HANDS ACCIDENTALLY MET SHE GAVE THE TIPS OF HIS
FINGERS A QUICK SQUEEZE THAT SEEMED TO INVITE NOT DESIRE BUT AFFECTION IT
STRUCK HIM THAT WHEN ONE LIVED WITH A WOMAN THIS PARTICULAR DISAPPOINTMENT
MUST BE A NORMAL RECURRING EVENT AND A DEEP TENDERNESS SUCH AS HE HAD
NOT FELT FOR HER BEFORE SUDDENLY TOOK HOLD OF HIM HE WISHED THAT THEY
WERE A MARRIED COUPLE OF TEN YEARS STANDING HE WISHED THAT HE WERE
WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS WITH HER JUST AS THEY WERE DOING NOW BUT OPENLY
AND WITHOUT FEAR TALKING OF TRIVIALITIES AND BUYING ODDS AND ENDS FOR THE
HOUSEHOLD HE WISHED ABOVE ALL THAT THEY HAD SOME PLACE WHERE THEY COULD
BE ALONE TOGETHER WITHOUT FEELING THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE LOVE EVERY TIME
THEY MET IT WAS NOT ACTUALLY AT THAT MOMENT BUT AT SOME TIME ON THE
FOLLOWING DAY THAT THE IDEA OF RENTING MR CHARRINGTONS ROOM HAD OCCURRED
TO HIM WHEN HE SUGGESTED IT TO JULIA SHE HAD AGREED WITH UNEXPECTED
READINESS BOTH OF THEM KNEW THAT IT WAS LUNACY IT WAS AS THOUGH THEY WERE
INTENTIONALLY STEPPING NEARER TO THEIR GRAVES AS HE SAT WAITING ON THE
EDGE OF THE BED HE THOUGHT AGAIN OF THE CELLARS OF THE MINISTRY OF LOVE
IT WAS CURIOUS HOW THAT PREDESTINED HORROR MOVED IN AND OUT OF ONES
CONSCIOUSNESS THERE IT LAY FIXED IN FUTURE TIMES PRECEDING DEATH AS
SURELY AS 99 PRECEDES 100 ONE COULD NOT AVOID IT BUT ONE COULD PERHAPS
POSTPONE IT AND YET INSTEAD EVERY NOW AND AGAIN BY A CONSCIOUS WILFUL
ACT ONE CHOSE TO SHORTEN THE INTERVAL BEFORE IT HAPPENED

AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A QUICK STEP ON THE STAIRS JULIA BURST INTO THE
ROOM SHE WAS CARRYING A TOOLBAG OF COARSE BROWN CANVAS SUCH AS HE HAD
SOMETIMES SEEN HER CARRYING TO AND FRO AT THE MINISTRY HE STARTED FORWARD
TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS BUT SHE DISENGAGED HERSELF RATHER HURRIEDLY
PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS STILL HOLDING THE TOOLBAG

HALF A SECOND SHE SAID JUST LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IVE BROUGHT DID
YOU BRING SOME OF THAT FILTHY VICTORY COFFEE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD YOU
CAN CHUCK IT AWAY AGAIN BECAUSE WE SHANT BE NEEDING IT LOOK HERE

SHE FELL ON HER KNEES THREW OPEN THE BAG AND TUMBLED OUT SOME SPANNERS
AND A SCREWDRIVER THAT FILLED THE TOP PART OF IT UNDERNEATH WERE A NUMBER
OF NEAT PAPER PACKETS THE FIRST PACKET THAT SHE PASSED TO WINSTON HAD A
STRANGE AND YET VAGUELY FAMILIAR FEELING IT WAS FILLED WITH SOME KIND OF
HEAVY SANDLIKE STUFF WHICH YIELDED WHEREVER YOU TOUCHED IT

IT ISNT SUGAR HE SAID

REAL SUGAR NOT SACCHARINE SUGAR AND HERES A LOAF OF BREADPROPER
WHITE BREAD NOT OUR BLOODY STUFFAND A LITTLE POT OF JAM AND HERES A
TIN OF MILKBUT LOOK THIS IS THE ONE IM REALLY PROUD OF I HAD TO WRAP
A BIT OF SACKING ROUND IT BECAUSE

BUT SHE DID NOT NEED TO TELL HIM WHY SHE HAD WRAPPED IT UP THE SMELL WAS
ALREADY FILLING THE ROOM A RICH HOT SMELL WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN EMANATION
FROM HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD BUT WHICH ONE DID OCCASIONALLY MEET WITH EVEN
NOW BLOWING DOWN A PASSAGEWAY BEFORE A DOOR SLAMMED OR DIFFUSING ITSELF
MYSTERIOUSLY IN A CROWDED STREET SNIFFED FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN LOST
AGAIN

ITS COFFEE HE MURMURED REAL COFFEE

ITS INNER PARTY COFFEE THERES A WHOLE KILO HERE SHE SAID

HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET HOLD OF ALL THESE THINGS

ITS ALL INNER PARTY STUFF THERES NOTHING THOSE SWINE DONT HAVE
NOTHING BUT OF COURSE WAITERS AND SERVANTS AND PEOPLE PINCH THINGS
ANDLOOK I GOT A LITTLE PACKET OF TEA AS WELL

WINSTON HAD SQUATTED DOWN BESIDE HER HE TORE OPEN A CORNER OF THE PACKET

ITS REAL TEA NOT BLACKBERRY LEAVES

THERES BEEN A LOT OF TEA ABOUT LATELY THEYVE CAPTURED INDIA OR
SOMETHING SHE SAID VAGUELY BUT LISTEN DEAR I WANT YOU TO TURN YOUR
BACK ON ME FOR THREE MINUTES GO AND SIT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED
DONT GO TOO NEAR THE WINDOW AND DONT TURN ROUND TILL I TELL YOU

WINSTON GAZED ABSTRACTEDLY THROUGH THE MUSLIN CURTAIN DOWN IN THE YARD
THE REDARMED WOMAN WAS STILL MARCHING TO AND FRO BETWEEN THE WASHTUB AND
THE LINE SHE TOOK TWO MORE PEGS OUT OF HER MOUTH AND SANG WITH DEEP
FEELING


THEY SYE THAT TIME EALS ALL THINGS
THEY SYE YOU CAN ALWAYS FORGET
BUT THE SMILES AN THE TEARS ACRORSS THE YEARS
THEY TWIST MY EARTSTRINGS YET


SHE KNEW THE WHOLE DRIVELLING SONG BY HEART IT SEEMED HER VOICE FLOATED
UPWARD WITH THE SWEET SUMMER AIR VERY TUNEFUL CHARGED WITH A SORT OF
HAPPY MELANCHOLY ONE HAD THE FEELING THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY
CONTENT IF THE JUNE EVENING HAD BEEN ENDLESS AND THE SUPPLY OF CLOTHES
INEXHAUSTIBLE TO REMAIN THERE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS PEGGING OUT DIAPERS
AND SINGING RUBBISH IT STRUCK HIM AS A CURIOUS FACT THAT HE HAD NEVER
HEARD A MEMBER OF THE PARTY SINGING ALONE AND SPONTANEOUSLY IT WOULD EVEN
HAVE SEEMED SLIGHTLY UNORTHODOX A DANGEROUS ECCENTRICITY LIKE TALKING TO
ONESELF PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY WHEN PEOPLE WERE SOMEWHERE NEAR THE STARVATION
LEVEL THAT THEY HAD ANYTHING TO SING ABOUT

YOU CAN TURN ROUND NOW SAID JULIA

HE TURNED ROUND AND FOR A SECOND ALMOST FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HER WHAT HE
HAD ACTUALLY EXPECTED WAS TO SEE HER NAKED BUT SHE WAS NOT NAKED THE
TRANSFORMATION THAT HAD HAPPENED WAS MUCH MORE SURPRISING THAN THAT SHE
HAD PAINTED HER FACE

SHE MUST HAVE SLIPPED INTO SOME SHOP IN THE PROLETARIAN QUARTERS AND BOUGHT
HERSELF A COMPLETE SET OF MAKEUP MATERIALS HER LIPS WERE DEEPLY REDDENED
HER CHEEKS ROUGED HER NOSE POWDERED THERE WAS EVEN A TOUCH OF SOMETHING
UNDER THE EYES TO MAKE THEM BRIGHTER IT WAS NOT VERY SKILFULLY DONE BUT
WINSTONS STANDARDS IN SUCH MATTERS WERE NOT HIGH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE
SEEN OR IMAGINED A WOMAN OF THE PARTY WITH COSMETICS ON HER FACE THE
IMPROVEMENT IN HER APPEARANCE WAS STARTLING WITH JUST A FEW DABS OF COLOUR
IN THE RIGHT PLACES SHE HAD BECOME NOT ONLY VERY MUCH PRETTIER BUT ABOVE
ALL FAR MORE FEMININE HER SHORT HAIR AND BOYISH OVERALLS MERELY ADDED
TO THE EFFECT AS HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS A WAVE OF SYNTHETIC VIOLETS
FLOODED HIS NOSTRILS HE REMEMBERED THE HALFDARKNESS OF A BASEMENT
KITCHEN AND A WOMANS CAVERNOUS MOUTH IT WAS THE VERY SAME SCENT THAT
SHE HAD USED BUT AT THE MOMENT IT DID NOT SEEM TO MATTER

SCENT TOO HE SAID

YES DEAR SCENT TOO AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IM GOING TO DO NEXT IM
GOING TO GET HOLD OF A REAL WOMANS FROCK FROM SOMEWHERE AND WEAR IT
INSTEAD OF THESE BLOODY TROUSERS ILL WEAR SILK STOCKINGS AND HIGHHEELED
SHOES IN THIS ROOM IM GOING TO BE A WOMAN NOT A PARTY COMRADE

THEY FLUNG THEIR CLOTHES OFF AND CLIMBED INTO THE HUGE MAHOGANY BED IT
WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAD STRIPPED HIMSELF NAKED IN HER PRESENCE
UNTIL NOW HE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH ASHAMED OF HIS PALE AND MEAGRE BODY WITH
THE VARICOSE VEINS STANDING OUT ON HIS CALVES AND THE DISCOLOURED PATCH
OVER HIS ANKLE THERE WERE NO SHEETS BUT THE BLANKET THEY LAY ON WAS
THREADBARE AND SMOOTH AND THE SIZE AND SPRINGINESS OF THE BED ASTONISHED
BOTH OF THEM ITS SURE TO BE FULL OF BUGS BUT WHO CARES SAID JULIA
ONE NEVER SAW A DOUBLE BED NOWADAYS EXCEPT IN THE HOMES OF THE PROLES
WINSTON HAD OCCASIONALLY SLEPT IN ONE IN HIS BOYHOOD JULIA HAD NEVER BEEN
IN ONE BEFORE SO FAR AS SHE COULD REMEMBER

PRESENTLY THEY FELL ASLEEP FOR A LITTLE WHILE WHEN WINSTON WOKE UP THE
HANDS OF THE CLOCK HAD CREPT ROUND TO NEARLY NINE HE DID NOT STIR BECAUSE
JULIA WAS SLEEPING WITH HER HEAD IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM MOST OF HER
MAKEUP HAD TRANSFERRED ITSELF TO HIS OWN FACE OR THE BOLSTER BUT A LIGHT
STAIN OF ROUGE STILL BROUGHT OUT THE BEAUTY OF HER CHEEKBONE A YELLOW RAY
FROM THE SINKING SUN FELL ACROSS THE FOOT OF THE BED AND LIGHTED UP THE
FIREPLACE WHERE THE WATER IN THE PAN WAS BOILING FAST DOWN IN THE YARD
THE WOMAN HAD STOPPED SINGING BUT THE FAINT SHOUTS OF CHILDREN FLOATED IN
FROM THE STREET HE WONDERED VAGUELY WHETHER IN THE ABOLISHED PAST IT HAD
BEEN A NORMAL EXPERIENCE TO LIE IN BED LIKE THIS IN THE COOL OF A SUMMER
EVENING A MAN AND A WOMAN WITH NO CLOTHES ON MAKING LOVE WHEN THEY CHOSE
TALKING OF WHAT THEY CHOSE NOT FEELING ANY COMPULSION TO GET UP SIMPLY
LYING THERE AND LISTENING TO PEACEFUL SOUNDS OUTSIDE SURELY THERE COULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN A TIME WHEN THAT SEEMED ORDINARY JULIA WOKE UP RUBBED
HER EYES AND RAISED HERSELF ON HER ELBOW TO LOOK AT THE OILSTOVE

HALF THAT WATERS BOILED AWAY SHE SAID ILL GET UP AND MAKE SOME
COFFEE IN ANOTHER MOMENT WEVE GOT AN HOUR WHAT TIME DO THEY CUT THE
LIGHTS OFF AT YOUR FLATS

TWENTYTHREE THIRTY

ITS TWENTYTHREE AT THE HOSTEL BUT YOU HAVE TO GET IN EARLIER THAN THAT
BECAUSEHI GET OUT YOU FILTHY BRUTE

SHE SUDDENLY TWISTED HERSELF OVER IN THE BED SEIZED A SHOE FROM THE FLOOR
AND SENT IT HURTLING INTO THE CORNER WITH A BOYISH JERK OF HER ARM EXACTLY
AS HE HAD SEEN HER FLING THE DICTIONARY AT GOLDSTEIN THAT MORNING DURING
THE TWO MINUTES HATE

WHAT WAS IT HE SAID IN SURPRISE

A RAT I SAW HIM STICK HIS BEASTLY NOSE OUT OF THE WAINSCOTING THERES A
HOLE DOWN THERE I GAVE HIM A GOOD FRIGHT ANYWAY

RATS MURMURED WINSTON IN THIS ROOM

THEYRE ALL OVER THE PLACE SAID JULIA INDIFFERENTLY AS SHE LAY DOWN
AGAIN WEVE EVEN GOT THEM IN THE KITCHEN AT THE HOSTEL SOME PARTS OF
LONDON ARE SWARMING WITH THEM DID YOU KNOW THEY ATTACK CHILDREN YES
THEY DO IN SOME OF THESE STREETS A WOMAN DARENT LEAVE A BABY ALONE FOR
TWO MINUTES ITS THE GREAT HUGE BROWN ONES THAT DO IT AND THE NASTY
THING IS THAT THE BRUTES ALWAYS

DONT GO ON SAID WINSTON WITH HIS EYES TIGHTLY SHUT

DEAREST YOUVE GONE QUITE PALE WHATS THE MATTER DO THEY MAKE YOU FEEL
SICK

OF ALL HORRORS IN THE WORLDA RAT

SHE PRESSED HERSELF AGAINST HIM AND WOUND HER LIMBS ROUND HIM AS THOUGH
TO REASSURE HIM WITH THE WARMTH OF HER BODY HE DID NOT REOPEN HIS EYES
IMMEDIATELY FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS HE HAD HAD THE FEELING OF BEING BACK IN A
NIGHTMARE WHICH HAD RECURRED FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE IT WAS
ALWAYS VERY MUCH THE SAME HE WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF A WALL OF DARKNESS
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNENDURABLE SOMETHING TOO
DREADFUL TO BE FACED IN THE DREAM HIS DEEPEST FEELING WAS ALWAYS ONE OF
SELFDECEPTION BECAUSE HE DID IN FACT KNOW WHAT WAS BEHIND THE WALL OF
DARKNESS WITH A DEADLY EFFORT LIKE WRENCHING A PIECE OUT OF HIS OWN
BRAIN HE COULD EVEN HAVE DRAGGED THE THING INTO THE OPEN HE ALWAYS WOKE
UP WITHOUT DISCOVERING WHAT IT WAS BUT SOMEHOW IT WAS CONNECTED WITH WHAT
JULIA HAD BEEN SAYING WHEN HE CUT HER SHORT

IM SORRY HE SAID ITS NOTHING I DONT LIKE RATS THATS ALL

DONT WORRY DEAR WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE FILTHY BRUTES IN HERE
ILL STUFF THE HOLE WITH A BIT OF SACKING BEFORE WE GO AND NEXT TIME WE
COME HERE ILL BRING SOME PLASTER AND BUNG IT UP PROPERLY

ALREADY THE BLACK INSTANT OF PANIC WAS HALFFORGOTTEN FEELING SLIGHTLY
ASHAMED OF HIMSELF HE SAT UP AGAINST THE BEDHEAD JULIA GOT OUT OF BED
PULLED ON HER OVERALLS AND MADE THE COFFEE THE SMELL THAT ROSE FROM THE
SAUCEPAN WAS SO POWERFUL AND EXCITING THAT THEY SHUT THE WINDOW LEST
ANYBODY OUTSIDE SHOULD NOTICE IT AND BECOME INQUISITIVE WHAT WAS EVEN
BETTER THAN THE TASTE OF THE COFFEE WAS THE SILKY TEXTURE GIVEN TO IT BY
THE SUGAR A THING WINSTON HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN AFTER YEARS OF SACCHARINE
WITH ONE HAND IN HER POCKET AND A PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM IN THE OTHER
JULIA WANDERED ABOUT THE ROOM GLANCING INDIFFERENTLY AT THE BOOKCASE
POINTING OUT THE BEST WAY OF REPAIRING THE GATELEG TABLE PLUMPING HERSELF
DOWN IN THE RAGGED ARMCHAIR TO SEE IF IT WAS COMFORTABLE AND EXAMINING
THE ABSURD TWELVEHOUR CLOCK WITH A SORT OF TOLERANT AMUSEMENT SHE BROUGHT
THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT OVER TO THE BED TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT IN A BETTER
LIGHT HE TOOK IT OUT OF HER HAND FASCINATED AS ALWAYS BY THE SOFT
RAINWATERY APPEARANCE OF THE GLASS

WHAT IS IT DO YOU THINK SAID JULIA

I DONT THINK ITS ANYTHINGI MEAN I DONT THINK IT WAS EVER PUT TO ANY
USE THATS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT ITS A LITTLE CHUNK OF HISTORY THAT
THEYVE FORGOTTEN TO ALTER ITS A MESSAGE FROM A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IF
ONE KNEW HOW TO READ IT

AND THAT PICTURE OVER THERESHE NODDED AT THE ENGRAVING ON THE OPPOSITE
WALLWOULD THAT BE A HUNDRED YEARS OLD

MORE TWO HUNDRED I DARE SAY ONE CANT TELL ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER
THE AGE OF ANYTHING NOWADAYS

SHE WENT OVER TO LOOK AT IT HERES WHERE THAT BRUTE STUCK HIS NOSE OUT
SHE SAID KICKING THE WAINSCOTING IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE PICTURE WHAT IS
THIS PLACE IVE SEEN IT BEFORE SOMEWHERE

ITS A CHURCH OR AT LEAST IT USED TO BE ST CLEMENT DANES ITS NAME WAS
THE FRAGMENT OF RHYME THAT MR CHARRINGTON HAD TAUGHT HIM CAME BACK INTO
HIS HEAD AND HE ADDED HALFNOSTALGICALLY ORANGES AND LEMONS SAY THE
BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS

TO HIS ASTONISHMENT SHE CAPPED THE LINE


YOU OWE ME THREE FARTHINGS SAY THE BELLS OF ST MARTINS
WHEN WILL YOU PAY ME SAY THE BELLS OF OLD BAILEY


I CANT REMEMBER HOW IT GOES ON AFTER THAT BUT ANYWAY I REMEMBER IT ENDS
UP HERE COMES A CANDLE TO LIGHT YOU TO BED HERE COMES A CHOPPER TO CHOP
OFF YOUR HEAD

IT WAS LIKE THE TWO HALVES OF A COUNTERSIGN BUT THERE MUST BE ANOTHER
LINE AFTER THE BELLS OF OLD BAILEY PERHAPS IT COULD BE DUG OUT OF
MR CHARRINGTONS MEMORY IF HE WERE SUITABLY PROMPTED

WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT HE SAID

MY GRANDFATHER HE USED TO SAY IT TO ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL HE WAS
VAPORIZED WHEN I WAS EIGHTAT ANY RATE HE DISAPPEARED I WONDER WHAT A
LEMON WAS SHE ADDED INCONSEQUENTLY IVE SEEN ORANGES THEYRE A KIND
OF ROUND YELLOW FRUIT WITH A THICK SKIN

I CAN REMEMBER LEMONS SAID WINSTON THEY WERE QUITE COMMON IN THE
FIFTIES THEY WERE SO SOUR THAT IT SET YOUR TEETH ON EDGE EVEN TO SMELL
THEM

I BET THAT PICTURES GOT BUGS BEHIND IT SAID JULIA ILL TAKE IT DOWN
AND GIVE IT A GOOD CLEAN SOME DAY I SUPPOSE ITS ALMOST TIME WE WERE
LEAVING I MUST START WASHING THIS PAINT OFF WHAT A BORE ILL GET THE
LIPSTICK OFF YOUR FACE AFTERWARDS

WINSTON DID NOT GET UP FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE THE ROOM WAS DARKENING HE
TURNED OVER TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND LAY GAZING INTO THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT
THE INEXHAUSTIBLY INTERESTING THING WAS NOT THE FRAGMENT OF CORAL BUT THE
INTERIOR OF THE GLASS ITSELF THERE WAS SUCH A DEPTH OF IT AND YET IT WAS
ALMOST AS TRANSPARENT AS AIR IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SURFACE OF THE GLASS
HAD BEEN THE ARCH OF THE SKY ENCLOSING A TINY WORLD WITH ITS ATMOSPHERE
COMPLETE HE HAD THE FEELING THAT HE COULD GET INSIDE IT AND THAT IN
FACT HE WAS INSIDE IT ALONG WITH THE MAHOGANY BED AND THE GATELEG TABLE
AND THE CLOCK AND THE STEEL ENGRAVING AND THE PAPERWEIGHT ITSELF THE
PAPERWEIGHT WAS THE ROOM HE WAS IN AND THE CORAL WAS JULIAS LIFE AND HIS
OWN FIXED IN A SORT OF ETERNITY AT THE HEART OF THE CRYSTAL




CHAPTER 5



SYME HAD VANISHED A MORNING CAME AND HE WAS MISSING FROM WORK A FEW
THOUGHTLESS PEOPLE COMMENTED ON HIS ABSENCE ON THE NEXT DAY NOBODY
MENTIONED HIM ON THE THIRD DAY WINSTON WENT INTO THE VESTIBULE OF THE
RECORDS DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT THE NOTICEBOARD ONE OF THE NOTICES CARRIED
A PRINTED LIST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CHESS COMMITTEE OF WHOM SYME HAD
BEEN ONE IT LOOKED ALMOST EXACTLY AS IT HAD LOOKED BEFORENOTHING HAD
BEEN CROSSED OUTBUT IT WAS ONE NAME SHORTER IT WAS ENOUGH SYME HAD
CEASED TO EXIST HE HAD NEVER EXISTED

THE WEATHER WAS BAKING HOT IN THE LABYRINTHINE MINISTRY THE WINDOWLESS
AIRCONDITIONED ROOMS KEPT THEIR NORMAL TEMPERATURE BUT OUTSIDE THE
PAVEMENTS SCORCHED ONES FEET AND THE STENCH OF THE TUBES AT THE RUSH HOURS
WAS A HORROR THE PREPARATIONS FOR HATE WEEK WERE IN FULL SWING AND THE
STAFFS OF ALL THE MINISTRIES WERE WORKING OVERTIME PROCESSIONS MEETINGS
MILITARY PARADES LECTURES WAXWORKS DISPLAYS FILM SHOWS TELESCREEN
PROGRAMMES ALL HAD TO BE ORGANIZED STANDS HAD TO BE ERECTED EFFIGIES
BUILT SLOGANS COINED SONGS WRITTEN RUMOURS CIRCULATED PHOTOGRAPHS
FAKED JULIAS UNIT IN THE FICTION DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF THE
PRODUCTION OF NOVELS AND WAS RUSHING OUT A SERIES OF ATROCITY PAMPHLETS
WINSTON IN ADDITION TO HIS REGULAR WORK SPENT LONG PERIODS EVERY DAY IN
GOING THROUGH BACK FILES OF THE TIMES AND ALTERING AND EMBELLISHING NEWS
ITEMS WHICH WERE TO BE QUOTED IN SPEECHES LATE AT NIGHT WHEN CROWDS OF
ROWDY PROLES ROAMED THE STREETS THE TOWN HAD A CURIOUSLY FEBRILE AIR THE
ROCKET BOMBS CRASHED OFTENER THAN EVER AND SOMETIMES IN THE FAR DISTANCE
THERE WERE ENORMOUS EXPLOSIONS WHICH NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN AND ABOUT WHICH
THERE WERE WILD RUMOURS

THE NEW TUNE WHICH WAS TO BE THE THEMESONG OF HATE WEEK THE HATE SONG
IT WAS CALLED HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPOSED AND WAS BEING ENDLESSLY PLUGGED
ON THE TELESCREENS IT HAD A SAVAGE BARKING RHYTHM WHICH COULD NOT EXACTLY
BE CALLED MUSIC BUT RESEMBLED THE BEATING OF A DRUM ROARED OUT BY
HUNDREDS OF VOICES TO THE TRAMP OF MARCHING FEET IT WAS TERRIFYING THE
PROLES HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO IT AND IN THE MIDNIGHT STREETS IT COMPETED
WITH THE STILLPOPULAR IT WAS ONLY A HOPELESS FANCY THE PARSONS CHILDREN
PLAYED IT AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND DAY UNBEARABLY ON A COMB AND A
PIECE OF TOILET PAPER WINSTONS EVENINGS WERE FULLER THAN EVER SQUADS OF
VOLUNTEERS ORGANIZED BY PARSONS WERE PREPARING THE STREET FOR HATE WEEK
STITCHING BANNERS PAINTING POSTERS ERECTING FLAGSTAFFS ON THE ROOFS AND
PERILOUSLY SLINGING WIRES ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE RECEPTION OF STREAMERS
PARSONS BOASTED THAT VICTORY MANSIONS ALONE WOULD DISPLAY FOUR HUNDRED
METRES OF BUNTING HE WAS IN HIS NATIVE ELEMENT AND AS HAPPY AS A LARK
THE HEAT AND THE MANUAL WORK HAD EVEN GIVEN HIM A PRETEXT FOR REVERTING
TO SHORTS AND AN OPEN SHIRT IN THE EVENINGS HE WAS EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
PUSHING PULLING SAWING HAMMERING IMPROVISING JOLLYING EVERYONE ALONG
WITH COMRADELY EXHORTATIONS AND GIVING OUT FROM EVERY FOLD OF HIS BODY WHAT
SEEMED AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF ACRIDSMELLING SWEAT

A NEW POSTER HAD SUDDENLY APPEARED ALL OVER LONDON IT HAD NO CAPTION
AND REPRESENTED SIMPLY THE MONSTROUS FIGURE OF A EURASIAN SOLDIER THREE
OR FOUR METRES HIGH STRIDING FORWARD WITH EXPRESSIONLESS MONGOLIAN FACE
AND ENORMOUS BOOTS A SUBMACHINE GUN POINTED FROM HIS HIP FROM WHATEVER
ANGLE YOU LOOKED AT THE POSTER THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN MAGNIFIED BY THE
FORESHORTENING SEEMED TO BE POINTED STRAIGHT AT YOU THE THING HAD BEEN
PLASTERED ON EVERY BLANK SPACE ON EVERY WALL EVEN OUTNUMBERING THE
PORTRAITS OF BIG BROTHER THE PROLES NORMALLY APATHETIC ABOUT THE WAR
WERE BEING LASHED INTO ONE OF THEIR PERIODICAL FRENZIES OF PATRIOTISM
AS THOUGH TO HARMONIZE WITH THE GENERAL MOOD THE ROCKET BOMBS HAD BEEN
KILLING LARGER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAN USUAL ONE FELL ON A CROWDED FILM
THEATRE IN STEPNEY BURYING SEVERAL HUNDRED VICTIMS AMONG THE RUINS THE
WHOLE POPULATION OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TURNED OUT FOR A LONG TRAILING
FUNERAL WHICH WENT ON FOR HOURS AND WAS IN EFFECT AN INDIGNATION MEETING
ANOTHER BOMB FELL ON A PIECE OF WASTE GROUND WHICH WAS USED AS A PLAYGROUND
AND SEVERAL DOZEN CHILDREN WERE BLOWN TO PIECES THERE WERE FURTHER ANGRY
DEMONSTRATIONS GOLDSTEIN WAS BURNED IN EFFIGY HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF THE
POSTER OF THE EURASIAN SOLDIER WERE TORN DOWN AND ADDED TO THE FLAMES AND
A NUMBER OF SHOPS WERE LOOTED IN THE TURMOIL THEN A RUMOUR FLEW ROUND
THAT SPIES WERE DIRECTING THE ROCKET BOMBS BY MEANS OF WIRELESS WAVES AND
AN OLD COUPLE WHO WERE SUSPECTED OF BEING OF FOREIGN EXTRACTION HAD THEIR
HOUSE SET ON FIRE AND PERISHED OF SUFFOCATION

IN THE ROOM OVER MR CHARRINGTONS SHOP WHEN THEY COULD GET THERE JULIA
AND WINSTON LAY SIDE BY SIDE ON A STRIPPED BED UNDER THE OPEN WINDOW
NAKED FOR THE SAKE OF COOLNESS THE RAT HAD NEVER COME BACK BUT THE BUGS
HAD MULTIPLIED HIDEOUSLY IN THE HEAT IT DID NOT SEEM TO MATTER DIRTY OR
CLEAN THE ROOM WAS PARADISE AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVED THEY WOULD SPRINKLE
EVERYTHING WITH PEPPER BOUGHT ON THE BLACK MARKET TEAR OFF THEIR CLOTHES
AND MAKE LOVE WITH SWEATING BODIES THEN FALL ASLEEP AND WAKE TO FIND THAT
THE BUGS HAD RALLIED AND WERE MASSING FOR THE COUNTERATTACK

FOUR FIVE SIXSEVEN TIMES THEY MET DURING THE MONTH OF JUNE WINSTON
HAD DROPPED HIS HABIT OF DRINKING GIN AT ALL HOURS HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST
THE NEED FOR IT HE HAD GROWN FATTER HIS VARICOSE ULCER HAD SUBSIDED
LEAVING ONLY A BROWN STAIN ON THE SKIN ABOVE HIS ANKLE HIS FITS OF
COUGHING IN THE EARLY MORNING HAD STOPPED THE PROCESS OF LIFE HAD CEASED
TO BE INTOLERABLE HE HAD NO LONGER ANY IMPULSE TO MAKE FACES AT THE
TELESCREEN OR SHOUT CURSES AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE NOW THAT THEY HAD A
SECURE HIDINGPLACE ALMOST A HOME IT DID NOT EVEN SEEM A HARDSHIP THAT
THEY COULD ONLY MEET INFREQUENTLY AND FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AT A TIME
WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT THE ROOM OVER THE JUNKSHOP SHOULD EXIST TO KNOW
THAT IT WAS THERE INVIOLATE WAS ALMOST THE SAME AS BEING IN IT THE ROOM
WAS A WORLD A POCKET OF THE PAST WHERE EXTINCT ANIMALS COULD WALK
MR CHARRINGTON THOUGHT WINSTON WAS ANOTHER EXTINCT ANIMAL HE USUALLY
STOPPED TO TALK WITH MR CHARRINGTON FOR A FEW MINUTES ON HIS WAY UPSTAIRS
THE OLD MAN SEEMED SELDOM OR NEVER TO GO OUT OF DOORS AND ON THE OTHER
HAND TO HAVE ALMOST NO CUSTOMERS HE LED A GHOSTLIKE EXISTENCE BETWEEN THE
TINY DARK SHOP AND AN EVEN TINIER BACK KITCHEN WHERE HE PREPARED HIS
MEALS AND WHICH CONTAINED AMONG OTHER THINGS AN UNBELIEVABLY ANCIENT
GRAMOPHONE WITH AN ENORMOUS HORN HE SEEMED GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO
TALK WANDERING ABOUT AMONG HIS WORTHLESS STOCK WITH HIS LONG NOSE AND
THICK SPECTACLES AND HIS BOWED SHOULDERS IN THE VELVET JACKET HE HAD
ALWAYS VAGUELY THE AIR OF BEING A COLLECTOR RATHER THAN A TRADESMAN
WITH A SORT OF FADED ENTHUSIASM HE WOULD FINGER THIS SCRAP OF RUBBISH OR
THATA CHINA BOTTLESTOPPER THE PAINTED LID OF A BROKEN SNUFFBOX A
PINCHBECK LOCKET CONTAINING A STRAND OF SOME LONGDEAD BABYS HAIRNEVER
ASKING THAT WINSTON SHOULD BUY IT MERELY THAT HE SHOULD ADMIRE IT TO
TALK TO HIM WAS LIKE LISTENING TO THE TINKLING OF A WORNOUT MUSICALBOX
HE HAD DRAGGED OUT FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS MEMORY SOME MORE FRAGMENTS OF
FORGOTTEN RHYMES THERE WAS ONE ABOUT FOUR AND TWENTY BLACKBIRDS AND
ANOTHER ABOUT A COW WITH A CRUMPLED HORN AND ANOTHER ABOUT THE DEATH
OF POOR COCK ROBIN IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED HE
WOULD SAY WITH A DEPRECATING LITTLE LAUGH WHENEVER HE PRODUCED A NEW
FRAGMENT BUT HE COULD NEVER RECALL MORE THAN A FEW LINES OF ANY ONE
RHYME

BOTH OF THEM KNEWIN A WAY IT WAS NEVER OUT OF THEIR MINDS THAT WHAT
WAS NOW HAPPENING COULD NOT LAST LONG THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE FACT OF
IMPENDING DEATH SEEMED AS PALPABLE AS THE BED THEY LAY ON AND THEY WOULD
CLING TOGETHER WITH A SORT OF DESPAIRING SENSUALITY LIKE A DAMNED SOUL
GRASPING AT HIS LAST MORSEL OF PLEASURE WHEN THE CLOCK IS WITHIN FIVE
MINUTES OF STRIKING BUT THERE WERE ALSO TIMES WHEN THEY HAD THE ILLUSION
NOT ONLY OF SAFETY BUT OF PERMANENCE SO LONG AS THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN
THIS ROOM THEY BOTH FELT NO HARM COULD COME TO THEM GETTING THERE WAS
DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS BUT THE ROOM ITSELF WAS SANCTUARY IT WAS AS WHEN
WINSTON HAD GAZED INTO THE HEART OF THE PAPERWEIGHT WITH THE FEELING THAT
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GET INSIDE THAT GLASSY WORLD AND THAT ONCE INSIDE
IT TIME COULD BE ARRESTED OFTEN THEY GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO DAYDREAMS OF
ESCAPE THEIR LUCK WOULD HOLD INDEFINITELY AND THEY WOULD CARRY ON THEIR
INTRIGUE JUST LIKE THIS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR NATURAL LIVES OR
KATHARINE WOULD DIE AND BY SUBTLE MANOEUVRINGS WINSTON AND JULIA WOULD
SUCCEED IN GETTING MARRIED OR THEY WOULD COMMIT SUICIDE TOGETHER OR
THEY WOULD DISAPPEAR ALTER THEMSELVES OUT OF RECOGNITION LEARN TO SPEAK
WITH PROLETARIAN ACCENTS GET JOBS IN A FACTORY AND LIVE OUT THEIR LIVES
UNDETECTED IN A BACKSTREET IT WAS ALL NONSENSE AS THEY BOTH KNEW IN
REALITY THERE WAS NO ESCAPE EVEN THE ONE PLAN THAT WAS PRACTICABLE
SUICIDE THEY HAD NO INTENTION OF CARRYING OUT TO HANG ON FROM DAY TO DAY
AND FROM WEEK TO WEEK SPINNING OUT A PRESENT THAT HAD NO FUTURE SEEMED
AN UNCONQUERABLE INSTINCT JUST AS ONES LUNGS WILL ALWAYS DRAW THE NEXT
BREATH SO LONG AS THERE IS AIR AVAILABLE

SOMETIMES TOO THEY TALKED OF ENGAGING IN ACTIVE REBELLION AGAINST THE
PARTY BUT WITH NO NOTION OF HOW TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP EVEN IF THE
FABULOUS BROTHERHOOD WAS A REALITY THERE STILL REMAINED THE DIFFICULTY
OF FINDING ONES WAY INTO IT HE TOLD HER OF THE STRANGE INTIMACY THAT
EXISTED OR SEEMED TO EXIST BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OBRIEN AND OF THE
IMPULSE HE SOMETIMES FELT SIMPLY TO WALK INTO OBRIENS PRESENCE ANNOUNCE
THAT HE WAS THE ENEMY OF THE PARTY AND DEMAND HIS HELP CURIOUSLY ENOUGH
THIS DID NOT STRIKE HER AS AN IMPOSSIBLY RASH THING TO DO SHE WAS USED TO
JUDGING PEOPLE BY THEIR FACES AND IT SEEMED NATURAL TO HER THAT WINSTON
SHOULD BELIEVE OBRIEN TO BE TRUSTWORTHY ON THE STRENGTH OF A SINGLE FLASH
OF THE EYES MOREOVER SHE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT EVERYONE OR NEARLY
EVERYONE SECRETLY HATED THE PARTY AND WOULD BREAK THE RULES IF HE THOUGHT
IT SAFE TO DO SO BUT SHE REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT WIDESPREAD ORGANIZED
OPPOSITION EXISTED OR COULD EXIST THE TALES ABOUT GOLDSTEIN AND HIS
UNDERGROUND ARMY SHE SAID WERE SIMPLY A LOT OF RUBBISH WHICH THE PARTY
HAD INVENTED FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES AND WHICH YOU HAD TO PRETEND TO BELIEVE
IN TIMES BEYOND NUMBER AT PARTY RALLIES AND SPONTANEOUS DEMONSTRATIONS
SHE HAD SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE FOR THE EXECUTION OF PEOPLE WHOSE
NAMES SHE HAD NEVER HEARD AND IN WHOSE SUPPOSED CRIMES SHE HAD NOT THE
FAINTEST BELIEF WHEN PUBLIC TRIALS WERE HAPPENING SHE HAD TAKEN HER PLACE
IN THE DETACHMENTS FROM THE YOUTH LEAGUE WHO SURROUNDED THE COURTS FROM
MORNING TO NIGHT CHANTING AT INTERVALS DEATH TO THE TRAITORS DURING
THE TWO MINUTES HATE SHE ALWAYS EXCELLED ALL OTHERS IN SHOUTING INSULTS
AT GOLDSTEIN YET SHE HAD ONLY THE DIMMEST IDEA OF WHO GOLDSTEIN WAS AND
WHAT DOCTRINES HE WAS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT SHE HAD GROWN UP SINCE THE
REVOLUTION AND WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE IDEOLOGICAL BATTLES OF THE
FIFTIES AND SIXTIES SUCH A THING AS AN INDEPENDENT POLITICAL MOVEMENT WAS
OUTSIDE HER IMAGINATION AND IN ANY CASE THE PARTY WAS INVINCIBLE IT
WOULD ALWAYS EXIST AND IT WOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME YOU COULD ONLY REBEL
AGAINST IT BY SECRET DISOBEDIENCE OR AT MOST BY ISOLATED ACTS OF
VIOLENCE SUCH AS KILLING SOMEBODY OR BLOWING SOMETHING UP

IN SOME WAYS SHE WAS FAR MORE ACUTE THAN WINSTON AND FAR LESS SUSCEPTIBLE
TO PARTY PROPAGANDA ONCE WHEN HE HAPPENED IN SOME CONNEXION TO MENTION
THE WAR AGAINST EURASIA SHE STARTLED HIM BY SAYING CASUALLY THAT IN HER
OPINION THE WAR WAS NOT HAPPENING THE ROCKET BOMBS WHICH FELL DAILY ON
LONDON WERE PROBABLY FIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF OCEANIA ITSELF JUST TO
KEEP PEOPLE FRIGHTENED THIS WAS AN IDEA THAT HAD LITERALLY NEVER OCCURRED
TO HIM SHE ALSO STIRRED A SORT OF ENVY IN HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT DURING
THE TWO MINUTES HATE HER GREAT DIFFICULTY WAS TO AVOID BURSTING OUT
LAUGHING BUT SHE ONLY QUESTIONED THE TEACHINGS OF THE PARTY WHEN THEY
IN SOME WAY TOUCHED UPON HER OWN LIFE OFTEN SHE WAS READY TO ACCEPT
THE OFFICIAL MYTHOLOGY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUTH AND
FALSEHOOD DID NOT SEEM IMPORTANT TO HER SHE BELIEVED FOR INSTANCE HAVING
LEARNT IT AT SCHOOL THAT THE PARTY HAD INVENTED AEROPLANES IN HIS OWN
SCHOOLDAYS WINSTON REMEMBERED IN THE LATE FIFTIES IT WAS ONLY THE
HELICOPTER THAT THE PARTY CLAIMED TO HAVE INVENTED A DOZEN YEARS LATER
WHEN JULIA WAS AT SCHOOL IT WAS ALREADY CLAIMING THE AEROPLANE ONE
GENERATION MORE AND IT WOULD BE CLAIMING THE STEAM ENGINE AND WHEN HE
TOLD HER THAT AEROPLANES HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE BEFORE HE WAS BORN AND LONG
BEFORE THE REVOLUTION THE FACT STRUCK HER AS TOTALLY UNINTERESTING AFTER
ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER WHO HAD INVENTED AEROPLANES IT WAS RATHER MORE
OF A SHOCK TO HIM WHEN HE DISCOVERED FROM SOME CHANCE REMARK THAT SHE DID
NOT REMEMBER THAT OCEANIA FOUR YEARS AGO HAD BEEN AT WAR WITH EASTASIA
AND AT PEACE WITH EURASIA IT WAS TRUE THAT SHE REGARDED THE WHOLE WAR AS
A SHAM BUT APPARENTLY SHE HAD NOT EVEN NOTICED THAT THE NAME OF THE ENEMY
HAD CHANGED I THOUGHT WED ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH EURASIA SHE SAID
VAGUELY IT FRIGHTENED HIM A LITTLE THE INVENTION OF AEROPLANES DATED
FROM LONG BEFORE HER BIRTH BUT THE SWITCHOVER IN THE WAR HAD HAPPENED
ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO WELL AFTER SHE WAS GROWN UP HE ARGUED WITH HER ABOUT
IT FOR PERHAPS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN THE END HE SUCCEEDED IN FORCING
HER MEMORY BACK UNTIL SHE DID DIMLY RECALL THAT AT ONE TIME EASTASIA AND
NOT EURASIA HAD BEEN THE ENEMY BUT THE ISSUE STILL STRUCK HER AS
UNIMPORTANT WHO CARES SHE SAID IMPATIENTLY ITS ALWAYS ONE BLOODY
WAR AFTER ANOTHER AND ONE KNOWS THE NEWS IS ALL LIES ANYWAY

SOMETIMES HE TALKED TO HER OF THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT AND THE IMPUDENT
FORGERIES THAT HE COMMITTED THERE SUCH THINGS DID NOT APPEAR TO HORRIFY
HER SHE DID NOT FEEL THE ABYSS OPENING BENEATH HER FEET AT THE THOUGHT
OF LIES BECOMING TRUTHS HE TOLD HER THE STORY OF JONES AARONSON AND
RUTHERFORD AND THE MOMENTOUS SLIP OF PAPER WHICH HE HAD ONCE HELD BETWEEN
HIS FINGERS IT DID NOT MAKE MUCH IMPRESSION ON HER AT FIRST INDEED SHE
FAILED TO GRASP THE POINT OF THE STORY

WERE THEY FRIENDS OF YOURS SHE SAID

NO I NEVER KNEW THEM THEY WERE INNER PARTY MEMBERS BESIDES THEY WERE
FAR OLDER MEN THAN I WAS THEY BELONGED TO THE OLD DAYS BEFORE THE
REVOLUTION I BARELY KNEW THEM BY SIGHT

THEN WHAT WAS THERE TO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED OFF ALL THE
TIME ARENT THEY

HE TRIED TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE IT WASNT
JUST A QUESTION OF SOMEBODY BEING KILLED DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE PAST
STARTING FROM YESTERDAY HAS BEEN ACTUALLY ABOLISHED IF IT SURVIVES
ANYWHERE ITS IN A FEW SOLID OBJECTS WITH NO WORDS ATTACHED TO THEM LIKE
THAT LUMP OF GLASS THERE ALREADY WE KNOW ALMOST LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT
THE REVOLUTION AND THE YEARS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION EVERY RECORD HAS BEEN
DESTROYED OR FALSIFIED EVERY BOOK HAS BEEN REWRITTEN EVERY PICTURE HAS
BEEN REPAINTED EVERY STATUE AND STREET AND BUILDING HAS BEEN RENAMED
EVERY DATE HAS BEEN ALTERED AND THAT PROCESS IS CONTINUING DAY BY DAY AND
MINUTE BY MINUTE HISTORY HAS STOPPED NOTHING EXISTS EXCEPT AN ENDLESS
PRESENT IN WHICH THE PARTY IS ALWAYS RIGHT I KNOW OF COURSE THAT THE
PAST IS FALSIFIED BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO PROVE IT EVEN
WHEN I DID THE FALSIFICATION MYSELF AFTER THE THING IS DONE NO EVIDENCE
EVER REMAINS THE ONLY EVIDENCE IS INSIDE MY OWN MIND AND I DONT KNOW
WITH ANY CERTAINTY THAT ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHARES MY MEMORIES JUST IN
THAT ONE INSTANCE IN MY WHOLE LIFE I DID POSSESS ACTUAL CONCRETE EVIDENCE
AFTER THE EVENTYEARS AFTER IT

AND WHAT GOOD WAS THAT

IT WAS NO GOOD BECAUSE I THREW IT AWAY A FEW MINUTES LATER BUT IF THE
SAME THING HAPPENED TODAY I SHOULD KEEP IT

WELL I WOULDNT SAID JULIA IM QUITE READY TO TAKE RISKS BUT ONLY
FOR SOMETHING WORTH WHILE NOT FOR BITS OF OLD NEWSPAPER WHAT COULD YOU
HAVE DONE WITH IT EVEN IF YOU HAD KEPT IT

NOT MUCH PERHAPS BUT IT WAS EVIDENCE IT MIGHT HAVE PLANTED A FEW DOUBTS
HERE AND THERE SUPPOSING THAT ID DARED TO SHOW IT TO ANYBODY I DONT
IMAGINE THAT WE CAN ALTER ANYTHING IN OUR OWN LIFETIME BUT ONE CAN IMAGINE
LITTLE KNOTS OF RESISTANCE SPRINGING UP HERE AND THERESMALL GROUPS OF
PEOPLE BANDING THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND GRADUALLY GROWING AND EVEN LEAVING
A FEW RECORDS BEHIND SO THAT THE NEXT GENERATIONS CAN CARRY ON WHERE WE
LEAVE OFF

IM NOT INTERESTED IN THE NEXT GENERATION DEAR IM INTERESTED IN US

YOURE ONLY A REBEL FROM THE WAIST DOWNWARDS HE TOLD HER

SHE THOUGHT THIS BRILLIANTLY WITTY AND FLUNG HER ARMS ROUND HIM IN DELIGHT

IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF PARTY DOCTRINE SHE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST INTEREST
WHENEVER HE BEGAN TO TALK OF THE PRINCIPLES OF INGSOC DOUBLETHINK THE
MUTABILITY OF THE PAST AND THE DENIAL OF OBJECTIVE REALITY AND TO USE
NEWSPEAK WORDS SHE BECAME BORED AND CONFUSED AND SAID THAT SHE NEVER PAID
ANY ATTENTION TO THAT KIND OF THING ONE KNEW THAT IT WAS ALL RUBBISH SO
WHY LET ONESELF BE WORRIED BY IT SHE KNEW WHEN TO CHEER AND WHEN TO BOO
AND THAT WAS ALL ONE NEEDED IF HE PERSISTED IN TALKING OF SUCH SUBJECTS
SHE HAD A DISCONCERTING HABIT OF FALLING ASLEEP SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE WHO CAN GO TO SLEEP AT ANY HOUR AND IN ANY POSITION TALKING TO HER
HE REALIZED HOW EASY IT WAS TO PRESENT AN APPEARANCE OF ORTHODOXY WHILE
HAVING NO GRASP WHATEVER OF WHAT ORTHODOXY MEANT IN A WAY THE WORLDVIEW
OF THE PARTY IMPOSED ITSELF MOST SUCCESSFULLY ON PEOPLE INCAPABLE OF
UNDERSTANDING IT THEY COULD BE MADE TO ACCEPT THE MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS
OF REALITY BECAUSE THEY NEVER FULLY GRASPED THE ENORMITY OF WHAT WAS
DEMANDED OF THEM AND WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN PUBLIC EVENTS TO
NOTICE WHAT WAS HAPPENING BY LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THEY REMAINED SANE
THEY SIMPLY SWALLOWED EVERYTHING AND WHAT THEY SWALLOWED DID THEM NO HARM
BECAUSE IT LEFT NO RESIDUE BEHIND JUST AS A GRAIN OF CORN WILL PASS
UNDIGESTED THROUGH THE BODY OF A BIRD




CHAPTER 6



IT HAD HAPPENED AT LAST THE EXPECTED MESSAGE HAD COME ALL HIS LIFE IT
SEEMED TO HIM HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN

HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR AT THE MINISTRY AND HE WAS ALMOST
AT THE SPOT WHERE JULIA HAD SLIPPED THE NOTE INTO HIS HAND WHEN HE BECAME
AWARE THAT SOMEONE LARGER THAN HIMSELF WAS WALKING JUST BEHIND HIM THE
PERSON WHOEVER IT WAS GAVE A SMALL COUGH EVIDENTLY AS A PRELUDE TO
SPEAKING WINSTON STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND TURNED IT WAS OBRIEN

AT LAST THEY WERE FACE TO FACE AND IT SEEMED THAT HIS ONLY IMPULSE WAS
TO RUN AWAY HIS HEART BOUNDED VIOLENTLY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN INCAPABLE OF
SPEAKING OBRIEN HOWEVER HAD CONTINUED FORWARD IN THE SAME MOVEMENT
LAYING A FRIENDLY HAND FOR A MOMENT ON WINSTONS ARM SO THAT THE TWO OF
THEM WERE WALKING SIDE BY SIDE HE BEGAN SPEAKING WITH THE PECULIAR GRAVE
COURTESY THAT DIFFERENTIATED HIM FROM THE MAJORITY OF INNER PARTY MEMBERS

I HAD BEEN HOPING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING TO YOU HE SAID I WAS
READING ONE OF YOUR NEWSPEAK ARTICLES IN THE TIMES THE OTHER DAY YOU
TAKE A SCHOLARLY INTEREST IN NEWSPEAK I BELIEVE

WINSTON HAD RECOVERED PART OF HIS SELFPOSSESSION HARDLY SCHOLARLY HE
SAID IM ONLY AN AMATEUR ITS NOT MY SUBJECT I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE LANGUAGE

BUT YOU WRITE IT VERY ELEGANTLY SAID OBRIEN THAT IS NOT ONLY MY OWN
OPINION I WAS TALKING RECENTLY TO A FRIEND OF YOURS WHO IS CERTAINLY AN
EXPERT HIS NAME HAS SLIPPED MY MEMORY FOR THE MOMENT

AGAIN WINSTONS HEART STIRRED PAINFULLY IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THIS
WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A REFERENCE TO SYME BUT SYME WAS NOT ONLY DEAD
HE WAS ABOLISHED AN UNPERSON ANY IDENTIFIABLE REFERENCE TO HIM WOULD HAVE
BEEN MORTALLY DANGEROUS OBRIENS REMARK MUST OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN INTENDED
AS A SIGNAL A CODEWORD BY SHARING A SMALL ACT OF THOUGHTCRIME HE HAD
TURNED THE TWO OF THEM INTO ACCOMPLICES THEY HAD CONTINUED TO STROLL
SLOWLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR BUT NOW OBRIEN HALTED WITH THE CURIOUS
DISARMING FRIENDLINESS THAT HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO PUT IN TO THE GESTURE HE
RESETTLED HIS SPECTACLES ON HIS NOSE THEN HE WENT ON

WHAT I HAD REALLY INTENDED TO SAY WAS THAT IN YOUR ARTICLE I NOTICED YOU
HAD USED TWO WORDS WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE BUT THEY HAVE ONLY BECOME
SO VERY RECENTLY HAVE YOU SEEN THE TENTH EDITION OF THE NEWSPEAK
DICTIONARY

NO SAID WINSTON I DIDNT THINK IT HAD BEEN ISSUED YET WE ARE STILL
USING THE NINTH IN THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT

THE TENTH EDITION IS NOT DUE TO APPEAR FOR SOME MONTHS I BELIEVE BUT A
FEW ADVANCE COPIES HAVE BEEN CIRCULATED I HAVE ONE MYSELF IT MIGHT
INTEREST YOU TO LOOK AT IT PERHAPS

VERY MUCH SO SAID WINSTON IMMEDIATELY SEEING WHERE THIS TENDED

SOME OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE MOST INGENIOUS THE REDUCTION IN THE
NUMBER OF VERBSTHAT IS THE POINT THAT WILL APPEAL TO YOU I THINK LET
ME SEE SHALL I SEND A MESSENGER TO YOU WITH THE DICTIONARY BUT I AM
AFRAID I INVARIABLY FORGET ANYTHING OF THAT KIND PERHAPS YOU COULD PICK
IT UP AT MY FLAT AT SOME TIME THAT SUITED YOU WAIT LET ME GIVE YOU MY
ADDRESS

THEY WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF A TELESCREEN SOMEWHAT ABSENTMINDEDLY
OBRIEN FELT TWO OF HIS POCKETS AND THEN PRODUCED A SMALL LEATHERCOVERED
NOTEBOOK AND A GOLD INKPENCIL IMMEDIATELY BENEATH THE TELESCREEN IN
SUCH A POSITION THAT ANYONE WHO WAS WATCHING AT THE OTHER END OF THE
INSTRUMENT COULD READ WHAT HE WAS WRITING HE SCRIBBLED AN ADDRESS TORE
OUT THE PAGE AND HANDED IT TO WINSTON

I AM USUALLY AT HOME IN THE EVENINGS HE SAID IF NOT MY SERVANT WILL
GIVE YOU THE DICTIONARY

HE WAS GONE LEAVING WINSTON HOLDING THE SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH THIS TIME
THERE WAS NO NEED TO CONCEAL NEVERTHELESS HE CAREFULLY MEMORIZED WHAT WAS
WRITTEN ON IT AND SOME HOURS LATER DROPPED IT INTO THE MEMORY HOLE ALONG
WITH A MASS OF OTHER PAPERS

THEY HAD BEEN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AT THE MOST
THERE WAS ONLY ONE MEANING THAT THE EPISODE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IT HAD
BEEN CONTRIVED AS A WAY OF LETTING WINSTON KNOW OBRIENS ADDRESS THIS
WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE EXCEPT BY DIRECT ENQUIRY IT WAS NEVER POSSIBLE TO
DISCOVER WHERE ANYONE LIVED THERE WERE NO DIRECTORIES OF ANY KIND IF
YOU EVER WANT TO SEE ME THIS IS WHERE I CAN BE FOUND WAS WHAT OBRIEN
HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIM PERHAPS THERE WOULD EVEN BE A MESSAGE CONCEALED
SOMEWHERE IN THE DICTIONARY BUT AT ANY RATE ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THE
CONSPIRACY THAT HE HAD DREAMED OF DID EXIST AND HE HAD REACHED THE OUTER
EDGES OF IT

HE KNEW THAT SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD OBEY OBRIENS SUMMONS PERHAPS
TOMORROW PERHAPS AFTER A LONG DELAYHE WAS NOT CERTAIN WHAT WAS
HAPPENING WAS ONLY THE WORKINGOUT OF A PROCESS THAT HAD STARTED YEARS
AGO THE FIRST STEP HAD BEEN A SECRET INVOLUNTARY THOUGHT THE SECOND
HAD BEEN THE OPENING OF THE DIARY HE HAD MOVED FROM THOUGHTS TO WORDS
AND NOW FROM WORDS TO ACTIONS THE LAST STEP WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD
HAPPEN IN THE MINISTRY OF LOVE HE HAD ACCEPTED IT THE END WAS CONTAINED
IN THE BEGINNING BUT IT WAS FRIGHTENING OR MORE EXACTLY IT WAS LIKE
A FORETASTE OF DEATH LIKE BEING A LITTLE LESS ALIVE EVEN WHILE HE WAS
SPEAKING TO OBRIEN WHEN THE MEANING OF THE WORDS HAD SUNK IN A CHILLY
SHUDDERING FEELING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS BODY HE HAD THE SENSATION
OF STEPPING INTO THE DAMPNESS OF A GRAVE AND IT WAS NOT MUCH BETTER
BECAUSE HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THE GRAVE WAS THERE AND WAITING FOR HIM




CHAPTER 7



WINSTON HAD WOKEN UP WITH HIS EYES FULL OF TEARS JULIA ROLLED SLEEPILY
AGAINST HIM MURMURING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHATS THE MATTER

I DREAMT HE BEGAN AND STOPPED SHORT IT WAS TOO COMPLEX TO BE PUT
INTO WORDS THERE WAS THE DREAM ITSELF AND THERE WAS A MEMORY CONNECTED
WITH IT THAT HAD SWUM INTO HIS MIND IN THE FEW SECONDS AFTER WAKING

HE LAY BACK WITH HIS EYES SHUT STILL SODDEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE
DREAM IT WAS A VAST LUMINOUS DREAM IN WHICH HIS WHOLE LIFE SEEMED TO
STRETCH OUT BEFORE HIM LIKE A LANDSCAPE ON A SUMMER EVENING AFTER RAIN
IT HAD ALL OCCURRED INSIDE THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT BUT THE SURFACE OF THE
GLASS WAS THE DOME OF THE SKY AND INSIDE THE DOME EVERYTHING WAS FLOODED
WITH CLEAR SOFT LIGHT IN WHICH ONE COULD SEE INTO INTERMINABLE DISTANCES
THE DREAM HAD ALSO BEEN COMPREHENDED BYINDEED IN SOME SENSE IT HAD
CONSISTED INA GESTURE OF THE ARM MADE BY HIS MOTHER AND MADE AGAIN
THIRTY YEARS LATER BY THE JEWISH WOMAN HE HAD SEEN ON THE NEWS FILM
TRYING TO SHELTER THE SMALL BOY FROM THE BULLETS BEFORE THE HELICOPTER
BLEW THEM BOTH TO PIECES

DO YOU KNOW HE SAID THAT UNTIL THIS MOMENT I BELIEVED I HAD MURDERED
MY MOTHER

WHY DID YOU MURDER HER SAID JULIA ALMOST ASLEEP

I DIDNT MURDER HER NOT PHYSICALLY

IN THE DREAM HE HAD REMEMBERED HIS LAST GLIMPSE OF HIS MOTHER AND WITHIN
A FEW MOMENTS OF WAKING THE CLUSTER OF SMALL EVENTS SURROUNDING IT HAD ALL
COME BACK IT WAS A MEMORY THAT HE MUST HAVE DELIBERATELY PUSHED OUT OF
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OVER MANY YEARS HE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE DATE BUT HE
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS THAN TEN YEARS OLD POSSIBLY TWELVE WHEN IT HAD
HAPPENED

HIS FATHER HAD DISAPPEARED SOME TIME EARLIER HOW MUCH EARLIER HE COULD
NOT REMEMBER HE REMEMBERED BETTER THE RACKETY UNEASY CIRCUMSTANCES OF
THE TIME THE PERIODICAL PANICS ABOUT AIRRAIDS AND THE SHELTERING IN TUBE
STATIONS THE PILES OF RUBBLE EVERYWHERE THE UNINTELLIGIBLE PROCLAMATIONS
POSTED AT STREET CORNERS THE GANGS OF YOUTHS IN SHIRTS ALL THE SAME
COLOUR THE ENORMOUS QUEUES OUTSIDE THE BAKERIES THE INTERMITTENT
MACHINEGUN FIRE IN THE DISTANCEABOVE ALL THE FACT THAT THERE WAS
NEVER ENOUGH TO EAT HE REMEMBERED LONG AFTERNOONS SPENT WITH OTHER BOYS
IN SCROUNGING ROUND DUSTBINS AND RUBBISH HEAPS PICKING OUT THE RIBS OF
CABBAGE LEAVES POTATO PEELINGS SOMETIMES EVEN SCRAPS OF STALE BREADCRUST
FROM WHICH THEY CAREFULLY SCRAPED AWAY THE CINDERS AND ALSO IN WAITING
FOR THE PASSING OF TRUCKS WHICH TRAVELLED OVER A CERTAIN ROUTE AND WERE
KNOWN TO CARRY CATTLE FEED AND WHICH WHEN THEY JOLTED OVER THE BAD
PATCHES IN THE ROAD SOMETIMES SPILT A FEW FRAGMENTS OF OILCAKE

WHEN HIS FATHER DISAPPEARED HIS MOTHER DID NOT SHOW ANY SURPRISE OR ANY
VIOLENT GRIEF BUT A SUDDEN CHANGE CAME OVER HER SHE SEEMED TO HAVE
BECOME COMPLETELY SPIRITLESS IT WAS EVIDENT EVEN TO WINSTON THAT SHE WAS
WAITING FOR SOMETHING THAT SHE KNEW MUST HAPPEN SHE DID EVERYTHING THAT
WAS NEEDEDCOOKED WASHED MENDED MADE THE BED SWEPT THE FLOOR DUSTED
THE MANTELPIECEALWAYS VERY SLOWLY AND WITH A CURIOUS LACK OF SUPERFLUOUS
MOTION LIKE AN ARTISTS LAYFIGURE MOVING OF ITS OWN ACCORD HER LARGE
SHAPELY BODY SEEMED TO RELAPSE NATURALLY INTO STILLNESS FOR HOURS AT A
TIME SHE WOULD SIT ALMOST IMMOBILE ON THE BED NURSING HIS YOUNG SISTER
A TINY AILING VERY SILENT CHILD OF TWO OR THREE WITH A FACE MADE SIMIAN
BY THINNESS VERY OCCASIONALLY SHE WOULD TAKE WINSTON IN HER ARMS AND
PRESS HIM AGAINST HER FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING HE WAS
AWARE IN SPITE OF HIS YOUTHFULNESS AND SELFISHNESS THAT THIS WAS SOMEHOW
CONNECTED WITH THE NEVERMENTIONED THING THAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN

HE REMEMBERED THE ROOM WHERE THEY LIVED A DARK CLOSESMELLING ROOM THAT
SEEMED HALF FILLED BY A BED WITH A WHITE COUNTERPANE THERE WAS A GAS RING
IN THE FENDER AND A SHELF WHERE FOOD WAS KEPT AND ON THE LANDING OUTSIDE
THERE WAS A BROWN EARTHENWARE SINK COMMON TO SEVERAL ROOMS HE REMEMBERED
HIS MOTHERS STATUESQUE BODY BENDING OVER THE GAS RING TO STIR AT SOMETHING
IN A SAUCEPAN ABOVE ALL HE REMEMBERED HIS CONTINUOUS HUNGER AND THE
FIERCE SORDID BATTLES AT MEALTIMES HE WOULD ASK HIS MOTHER NAGGINGLY
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHY THERE WAS NOT MORE FOOD HE WOULD SHOUT AND STORM
AT HER HE EVEN REMEMBERED THE TONES OF HIS VOICE WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO
BREAK PREMATURELY AND SOMETIMES BOOMED IN A PECULIAR WAY OR HE WOULD
ATTEMPT A SNIVELLING NOTE OF PATHOS IN HIS EFFORTS TO GET MORE THAN HIS
SHARE HIS MOTHER WAS QUITE READY TO GIVE HIM MORE THAN HIS SHARE SHE
TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE THE BOY SHOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST PORTION
BUT HOWEVER MUCH SHE GAVE HIM HE INVARIABLY DEMANDED MORE AT EVERY MEAL
SHE WOULD BESEECH HIM NOT TO BE SELFISH AND TO REMEMBER THAT HIS LITTLE
SISTER WAS SICK AND ALSO NEEDED FOOD BUT IT WAS NO USE HE WOULD CRY OUT
WITH RAGE WHEN SHE STOPPED LADLING HE WOULD TRY TO WRENCH THE SAUCEPAN
AND SPOON OUT OF HER HANDS HE WOULD GRAB BITS FROM HIS SISTERS PLATE
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS STARVING THE OTHER TWO BUT HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE
EVEN FELT THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DO IT THE CLAMOROUS HUNGER IN HIS BELLY
SEEMED TO JUSTIFY HIM BETWEEN MEALS IF HIS MOTHER DID NOT STAND GUARD
HE WAS CONSTANTLY PILFERING AT THE WRETCHED STORE OF FOOD ON THE SHELF

ONE DAY A CHOCOLATE RATION WAS ISSUED THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH ISSUE FOR
WEEKS OR MONTHS PAST HE REMEMBERED QUITE CLEARLY THAT PRECIOUS LITTLE
MORSEL OF CHOCOLATE IT WAS A TWOOUNCE SLAB THEY STILL TALKED ABOUT
OUNCES IN THOSE DAYS BETWEEN THE THREE OF THEM IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IT
OUGHT TO BE DIVIDED INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS SUDDENLY AS THOUGH HE WERE
LISTENING TO SOMEBODY ELSE WINSTON HEARD HIMSELF DEMANDING IN A LOUD
BOOMING VOICE THAT HE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE WHOLE PIECE HIS MOTHER TOLD HIM
NOT TO BE GREEDY THERE WAS A LONG NAGGING ARGUMENT THAT WENT ROUND AND
ROUND WITH SHOUTS WHINES TEARS REMONSTRANCES BARGAININGS HIS TINY
SISTER CLINGING TO HER MOTHER WITH BOTH HANDS EXACTLY LIKE A BABY MONKEY
SAT LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER AT HIM WITH LARGE MOURNFUL EYES IN THE
END HIS MOTHER BROKE OFF THREEQUARTERS OF THE CHOCOLATE AND GAVE IT TO
WINSTON GIVING THE OTHER QUARTER TO HIS SISTER THE LITTLE GIRL TOOK HOLD
OF IT AND LOOKED AT IT DULLY PERHAPS NOT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS WINSTON
STOOD WATCHING HER FOR A MOMENT THEN WITH A SUDDEN SWIFT SPRING HE HAD
SNATCHED THE PIECE OF CHOCOLATE OUT OF HIS SISTERS HAND AND WAS FLEEING
FOR THE DOOR

WINSTON WINSTON HIS MOTHER CALLED AFTER HIM COME BACK GIVE YOUR
SISTER BACK HER CHOCOLATE

HE STOPPED BUT DID NOT COME BACK HIS MOTHERS ANXIOUS EYES WERE FIXED ON
HIS FACE EVEN NOW HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE THING HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
IT WAS THAT WAS ON THE POINT OF HAPPENING HIS SISTER CONSCIOUS OF HAVING
BEEN ROBBED OF SOMETHING HAD SET UP A FEEBLE WAIL HIS MOTHER DREW HER
ARM ROUND THE CHILD AND PRESSED ITS FACE AGAINST HER BREAST SOMETHING IN
THE GESTURE TOLD HIM THAT HIS SISTER WAS DYING HE TURNED AND FLED DOWN
THE STAIRS WITH THE CHOCOLATE GROWING STICKY IN HIS HAND

HE NEVER SAW HIS MOTHER AGAIN AFTER HE HAD DEVOURED THE CHOCOLATE HE FELT
SOMEWHAT ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AND HUNG ABOUT IN THE STREETS FOR SEVERAL
HOURS UNTIL HUNGER DROVE HIM HOME WHEN HE CAME BACK HIS MOTHER HAD
DISAPPEARED THIS WAS ALREADY BECOMING NORMAL AT THAT TIME NOTHING WAS
GONE FROM THE ROOM EXCEPT HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER THEY HAD NOT TAKEN
ANY CLOTHES NOT EVEN HIS MOTHERS OVERCOAT TO THIS DAY HE DID NOT KNOW
WITH ANY CERTAINTY THAT HIS MOTHER WAS DEAD IT WAS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE
THAT SHE HAD MERELY BEEN SENT TO A FORCEDLABOUR CAMP AS FOR HIS SISTER
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REMOVED LIKE WINSTON HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE COLONIES
FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN RECLAMATION CENTRES THEY WERE CALLED WHICH HAD
GROWN UP AS A RESULT OF THE CIVIL WAR OR SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE
LABOUR CAMP ALONG WITH HIS MOTHER OR SIMPLY LEFT SOMEWHERE OR OTHER
TO DIE

THE DREAM WAS STILL VIVID IN HIS MIND ESPECIALLY THE ENVELOPING PROTECTING
GESTURE OF THE ARM IN WHICH ITS WHOLE MEANING SEEMED TO BE CONTAINED HIS
MIND WENT BACK TO ANOTHER DREAM OF TWO MONTHS AGO EXACTLY AS HIS MOTHER
HAD SAT ON THE DINGY WHITEQUILTED BED WITH THE CHILD CLINGING TO HER SO
SHE HAD SAT IN THE SUNKEN SHIP FAR UNDERNEATH HIM AND DROWNING DEEPER
EVERY MINUTE BUT STILL LOOKING UP AT HIM THROUGH THE DARKENING WATER

HE TOLD JULIA THE STORY OF HIS MOTHERS DISAPPEARANCE WITHOUT OPENING HER
EYES SHE ROLLED OVER AND SETTLED HERSELF INTO A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION

I EXPECT YOU WERE A BEASTLY LITTLE SWINE IN THOSE DAYS SHE SAID
INDISTINCTLY ALL CHILDREN ARE SWINE

YES BUT THE REAL POINT OF THE STORY

FROM HER BREATHING IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS GOING OFF TO SLEEP AGAIN
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT HIS MOTHER HE DID NOT
SUPPOSE FROM WHAT HE COULD REMEMBER OF HER THAT SHE HAD BEEN AN UNUSUAL
WOMAN STILL LESS AN INTELLIGENT ONE AND YET SHE HAD POSSESSED A KIND OF
NOBILITY A KIND OF PURITY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STANDARDS THAT SHE OBEYED
WERE PRIVATE ONES HER FEELINGS WERE HER OWN AND COULD NOT BE ALTERED
FROM OUTSIDE IT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN ACTION WHICH IS
INEFFECTUAL THEREBY BECOMES MEANINGLESS IF YOU LOVED SOMEONE YOU LOVED
HIM AND WHEN YOU HAD NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE YOU STILL GAVE HIM LOVE WHEN
THE LAST OF THE CHOCOLATE WAS GONE HIS MOTHER HAD CLASPED THE CHILD IN
HER ARMS IT WAS NO USE IT CHANGED NOTHING IT DID NOT PRODUCE MORE
CHOCOLATE IT DID NOT AVERT THE CHILDS DEATH OR HER OWN BUT IT SEEMED
NATURAL TO HER TO DO IT THE REFUGEE WOMAN IN THE BOAT HAD ALSO COVERED
THE LITTLE BOY WITH HER ARM WHICH WAS NO MORE USE AGAINST THE BULLETS
THAN A SHEET OF PAPER THE TERRIBLE THING THAT THE PARTY HAD DONE WAS TO
PERSUADE YOU THAT MERE IMPULSES MERE FEELINGS WERE OF NO ACCOUNT WHILE
AT THE SAME TIME ROBBING YOU OF ALL POWER OVER THE MATERIAL WORLD WHEN
ONCE YOU WERE IN THE GRIP OF THE PARTY WHAT YOU FELT OR DID NOT FEEL
WHAT YOU DID OR REFRAINED FROM DOING MADE LITERALLY NO DIFFERENCE
WHATEVER HAPPENED YOU VANISHED AND NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR ACTIONS WERE EVER
HEARD OF AGAIN YOU WERE LIFTED CLEAN OUT OF THE STREAM OF HISTORY AND
YET TO THE PEOPLE OF ONLY TWO GENERATIONS AGO THIS WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED
ALLIMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTEMPTING TO ALTER HISTORY THEY
WERE GOVERNED BY PRIVATE LOYALTIES WHICH THEY DID NOT QUESTION WHAT
MATTERED WERE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND A COMPLETELY HELPLESS GESTURE
AN EMBRACE A TEAR A WORD SPOKEN TO A DYING MAN COULD HAVE VALUE IN
ITSELF THE PROLES IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM HAD REMAINED IN THIS
CONDITION THEY WERE NOT LOYAL TO A PARTY OR A COUNTRY OR AN IDEA THEY
WERE LOYAL TO ONE ANOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE DID NOT
DESPISE THE PROLES OR THINK OF THEM MERELY AS AN INERT FORCE WHICH WOULD
ONE DAY SPRING TO LIFE AND REGENERATE THE WORLD THE PROLES HAD STAYED
HUMAN THEY HAD NOT BECOME HARDENED INSIDE THEY HAD HELD ON TO THE
PRIMITIVE EMOTIONS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD TO RELEARN BY CONSCIOUS EFFORT
AND IN THINKING THIS HE REMEMBERED WITHOUT APPARENT RELEVANCE HOW A FEW
WEEKS AGO HE HAD SEEN A SEVERED HAND LYING ON THE PAVEMENT AND HAD KICKED
IT INTO THE GUTTER AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A CABBAGESTALK

THE PROLES ARE HUMAN BEINGS HE SAID ALOUD WE ARE NOT HUMAN

WHY NOT SAID JULIA WHO HAD WOKEN UP AGAIN

HE THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE WHILE HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU HE SAID
THAT THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO WOULD BE SIMPLY TO WALK OUT OF HERE
BEFORE ITS TOO LATE AND NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN

YES DEAR IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES BUT IM NOT GOING TO DO
IT ALL THE SAME

WEVE BEEN LUCKY HE SAID BUT IT CANT LAST MUCH LONGER YOURE YOUNG
YOU LOOK NORMAL AND INNOCENT IF YOU KEEP CLEAR OF PEOPLE LIKE ME YOU
MIGHT STAY ALIVE FOR ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS

NO IVE THOUGHT IT ALL OUT WHAT YOU DO IM GOING TO DO AND DONT BE
TOO DOWNHEARTED IM RATHER GOOD AT STAYING ALIVE

WE MAY BE TOGETHER FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHSA YEARTHERES NO KNOWING
AT THE END WERE CERTAIN TO BE APART DO YOU REALIZE HOW UTTERLY ALONE WE
SHALL BE WHEN ONCE THEY GET HOLD OF US THERE WILL BE NOTHING LITERALLY
NOTHING THAT EITHER OF US CAN DO FOR THE OTHER IF I CONFESS THEYLL
SHOOT YOU AND IF I REFUSE TO CONFESS THEYLL SHOOT YOU JUST THE SAME
NOTHING THAT I CAN DO OR SAY OR STOP MYSELF FROM SAYING WILL PUT OFF
YOUR DEATH FOR AS MUCH AS FIVE MINUTES NEITHER OF US WILL EVEN KNOW
WHETHER THE OTHER IS ALIVE OR DEAD WE SHALL BE UTTERLY WITHOUT POWER OF
ANY KIND THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT WE SHOULDNT BETRAY ONE
ANOTHER ALTHOUGH EVEN THAT CANT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE

IF YOU MEAN CONFESSING SHE SAID WE SHALL DO THAT RIGHT ENOUGH
EVERYBODY ALWAYS CONFESSES YOU CANT HELP IT THEY TORTURE YOU

I DONT MEAN CONFESSING CONFESSION IS NOT BETRAYAL WHAT YOU SAY OR DO
DOESNT MATTER ONLY FEELINGS MATTER IF THEY COULD MAKE ME STOP LOVING
YOUTHAT WOULD BE THE REAL BETRAYAL

SHE THOUGHT IT OVER THEY CANT DO THAT SHE SAID FINALLY ITS THE ONE
THING THEY CANT DO THEY CAN MAKE YOU SAY ANYTHINGANYTHINGBUT THEY
CANT MAKE YOU BELIEVE IT THEY CANT GET INSIDE YOU

NO HE SAID A LITTLE MORE HOPEFULLY NO THATS QUITE TRUE THEY CANT
GET INSIDE YOU IF YOU CAN FEEL THAT STAYING HUMAN IS WORTH WHILE EVEN
WHEN IT CANT HAVE ANY RESULT WHATEVER YOUVE BEATEN THEM

HE THOUGHT OF THE TELESCREEN WITH ITS NEVERSLEEPING EAR THEY COULD SPY
UPON YOU NIGHT AND DAY BUT IF YOU KEPT YOUR HEAD YOU COULD STILL OUTWIT
THEM WITH ALL THEIR CLEVERNESS THEY HAD NEVER MASTERED THE SECRET OF
FINDING OUT WHAT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WAS THINKING PERHAPS THAT WAS LESS
TRUE WHEN YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN THEIR HANDS ONE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
INSIDE THE MINISTRY OF LOVE BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GUESS TORTURES DRUGS
DELICATE INSTRUMENTS THAT REGISTERED YOUR NERVOUS REACTIONS GRADUAL
WEARINGDOWN BY SLEEPLESSNESS AND SOLITUDE AND PERSISTENT QUESTIONING
FACTS AT ANY RATE COULD NOT BE KEPT HIDDEN THEY COULD BE TRACKED DOWN
BY ENQUIRY THEY COULD BE SQUEEZED OUT OF YOU BY TORTURE BUT IF THE OBJECT
WAS NOT TO STAY ALIVE BUT TO STAY HUMAN WHAT DIFFERENCE DID IT ULTIMATELY
MAKE THEY COULD NOT ALTER YOUR FEELINGS FOR THAT MATTER YOU COULD NOT
ALTER THEM YOURSELF EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO THEY COULD LAY BARE IN THE
UTMOST DETAIL EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAD DONE OR SAID OR THOUGHT BUT THE
INNER HEART WHOSE WORKINGS WERE MYSTERIOUS EVEN TO YOURSELF REMAINED
IMPREGNABLE




CHAPTER 8



THEY HAD DONE IT THEY HAD DONE IT AT LAST

THE ROOM THEY WERE STANDING IN WAS LONGSHAPED AND SOFTLY LIT THE
TELESCREEN WAS DIMMED TO A LOW MURMUR THE RICHNESS OF THE DARKBLUE CARPET
GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF TREADING ON VELVET AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
OBRIEN WAS SITTING AT A TABLE UNDER A GREENSHADED LAMP WITH A MASS OF
PAPERS ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM HE HAD NOT BOTHERED TO LOOK UP WHEN THE
SERVANT SHOWED JULIA AND WINSTON IN

WINSTONS HEART WAS THUMPING SO HARD THAT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD BE
ABLE TO SPEAK THEY HAD DONE IT THEY HAD DONE IT AT LAST WAS ALL HE
COULD THINK IT HAD BEEN A RASH ACT TO COME HERE AT ALL AND SHEER FOLLY
TO ARRIVE TOGETHER THOUGH IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD COME BY DIFFERENT
ROUTES AND ONLY MET ON OBRIENS DOORSTEP BUT MERELY TO WALK INTO SUCH A
PLACE NEEDED AN EFFORT OF THE NERVE IT WAS ONLY ON VERY RARE OCCASIONS
THAT ONE SAW INSIDE THE DWELLINGPLACES OF THE INNER PARTY OR EVEN
PENETRATED INTO THE QUARTER OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY LIVED THE WHOLE
ATMOSPHERE OF THE HUGE BLOCK OF FLATS THE RICHNESS AND SPACIOUSNESS OF
EVERYTHING THE UNFAMILIAR SMELLS OF GOOD FOOD AND GOOD TOBACCO THE
SILENT AND INCREDIBLY RAPID LIFTS SLIDING UP AND DOWN THE WHITEJACKETED
SERVANTS HURRYING TO AND FROEVERYTHING WAS INTIMIDATING ALTHOUGH HE HAD
A GOOD PRETEXT FOR COMING HERE HE WAS HAUNTED AT EVERY STEP BY THE FEAR
THAT A BLACKUNIFORMED GUARD WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR FROM ROUND THE CORNER
DEMAND HIS PAPERS AND ORDER HIM TO GET OUT OBRIENS SERVANT HOWEVER
HAD ADMITTED THE TWO OF THEM WITHOUT DEMUR HE WAS A SMALL DARKHAIRED
MAN IN A WHITE JACKET WITH A DIAMONDSHAPED COMPLETELY EXPRESSIONLESS
FACE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT OF A CHINESE THE PASSAGE DOWN WHICH HE
LED THEM WAS SOFTLY CARPETED WITH CREAMPAPERED WALLS AND WHITE
WAINSCOTING ALL EXQUISITELY CLEAN THAT TOO WAS INTIMIDATING WINSTON
COULD NOT REMEMBER EVER TO HAVE SEEN A PASSAGEWAY WHOSE WALLS WERE NOT
GRIMY FROM THE CONTACT OF HUMAN BODIES

OBRIEN HAD A SLIP OF PAPER BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AND SEEMED TO BE STUDYING
IT INTENTLY HIS HEAVY FACE BENT DOWN SO THAT ONE COULD SEE THE LINE OF
THE NOSE LOOKED BOTH FORMIDABLE AND INTELLIGENT FOR PERHAPS TWENTY
SECONDS HE SAT WITHOUT STIRRING THEN HE PULLED THE SPEAKWRITE TOWARDS
HIM AND RAPPED OUT A MESSAGE IN THE HYBRID JARGON OF THE MINISTRIES

ITEMS ONE COMMA FIVE COMMA SEVEN APPROVED FULLWISE STOP SUGGESTION
CONTAINED ITEM SIX DOUBLEPLUS RIDICULOUS VERGING CRIMETHINK CANCEL STOP
UNPROCEED CONSTRUCTIONWISE ANTEGETTING PLUSFULL ESTIMATES MACHINERY
OVERHEADS STOP END MESSAGE

HE ROSE DELIBERATELY FROM HIS CHAIR AND CAME TOWARDS THEM ACROSS THE
SOUNDLESS CARPET A LITTLE OF THE OFFICIAL ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN
AWAY FROM HIM WITH THE NEWSPEAK WORDS BUT HIS EXPRESSION WAS GRIMMER THAN
USUAL AS THOUGH HE WERE NOT PLEASED AT BEING DISTURBED THE TERROR THAT
WINSTON ALREADY FELT WAS SUDDENLY SHOT THROUGH BY A STREAK OF ORDINARY
EMBARRASSMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM QUITE POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY MADE A
STUPID MISTAKE FOR WHAT EVIDENCE HAD HE IN REALITY THAT OBRIEN WAS ANY
KIND OF POLITICAL CONSPIRATOR NOTHING BUT A FLASH OF THE EYES AND A SINGLE
EQUIVOCAL REMARK BEYOND THAT ONLY HIS OWN SECRET IMAGININGS FOUNDED ON
A DREAM HE COULD NOT EVEN FALL BACK ON THE PRETENCE THAT HE HAD COME TO
BORROW THE DICTIONARY BECAUSE IN THAT CASE JULIAS PRESENCE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO EXPLAIN AS OBRIEN PASSED THE TELESCREEN A THOUGHT SEEMED TO STRIKE
HIM HE STOPPED TURNED ASIDE AND PRESSED A SWITCH ON THE WALL THERE WAS
A SHARP SNAP THE VOICE HAD STOPPED

JULIA UTTERED A TINY SOUND A SORT OF SQUEAK OF SURPRISE EVEN IN THE MIDST
OF HIS PANIC WINSTON WAS TOO MUCH TAKEN ABACK TO BE ABLE TO HOLD HIS
TONGUE

YOU CAN TURN IT OFF HE SAID

YES SAID OBRIEN WE CAN TURN IT OFF WE HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE

HE WAS OPPOSITE THEM NOW HIS SOLID FORM TOWERED OVER THE PAIR OF THEM
AND THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WAS STILL INDECIPHERABLE HE WAS WAITING
SOMEWHAT STERNLY FOR WINSTON TO SPEAK BUT ABOUT WHAT EVEN NOW IT WAS
QUITE CONCEIVABLE THAT HE WAS SIMPLY A BUSY MAN WONDERING IRRITABLY WHY HE
HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED NOBODY SPOKE AFTER THE STOPPING OF THE TELESCREEN
THE ROOM SEEMED DEADLY SILENT THE SECONDS MARCHED PAST ENORMOUS WITH
DIFFICULTY WINSTON CONTINUED TO KEEP HIS EYES FIXED ON OBRIENS THEN
SUDDENLY THE GRIM FACE BROKE DOWN INTO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BEGINNINGS
OF A SMILE WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC GESTURE OBRIEN RESETTLED HIS
SPECTACLES ON HIS NOSE

SHALL I SAY IT OR WILL YOU HE SAID

I WILL SAY IT SAID WINSTON PROMPTLY THAT THING IS REALLY TURNED OFF

YES EVERYTHING IS TURNED OFF WE ARE ALONE

WE HAVE COME HERE BECAUSE

HE PAUSED REALIZING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE VAGUENESS OF
HIS OWN MOTIVES SINCE HE DID NOT IN FACT KNOW WHAT KIND OF
HELP HE EXPECTED FROM OBRIEN IT WAS NOT EASY TO SAY WHY HE
HAD COME HERE HE WENT ON CONSCIOUS THAT WHAT HE WAS SAYING
MUST SOUND BOTH FEEBLE AND PRETENTIOUS

WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY SOME KIND OF SECRET
ORGANIZATION WORKING AGAINST THE PARTY AND THAT YOU ARE INVOLVED IN IT
WE WANT TO JOIN IT AND WORK FOR IT WE ARE ENEMIES OF THE PARTY WE
DISBELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLES OF INGSOC WE ARE THOUGHTCRIMINALS WE ARE
ALSO ADULTERERS I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO PUT OURSELVES AT YOUR
MERCY IF YOU WANT US TO INCRIMINATE OURSELVES IN ANY OTHER WAY WE ARE
READY

HE STOPPED AND GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER WITH THE FEELING THAT THE DOOR
HAD OPENED SURE ENOUGH THE LITTLE YELLOWFACED SERVANT HAD COME IN
WITHOUT KNOCKING WINSTON SAW THAT HE WAS CARRYING A TRAY WITH A DECANTER
AND GLASSES

MARTIN IS ONE OF US SAID OBRIEN IMPASSIVELY BRING THE DRINKS OVER
HERE MARTIN PUT THEM ON THE ROUND TABLE HAVE WE ENOUGH CHAIRS THEN
WE MAY AS WELL SIT DOWN AND TALK IN COMFORT BRING A CHAIR FOR YOURSELF
MARTIN THIS IS BUSINESS YOU CAN STOP BEING A SERVANT FOR THE NEXT TEN
MINUTES

THE LITTLE MAN SAT DOWN QUITE AT HIS EASE AND YET STILL WITH A
SERVANTLIKE AIR THE AIR OF A VALET ENJOYING A PRIVILEGE WINSTON
REGARDED HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE MANS
WHOLE LIFE WAS PLAYING A PART AND THAT HE FELT IT TO BE DANGEROUS TO
DROP HIS ASSUMED PERSONALITY EVEN FOR A MOMENT OBRIEN TOOK THE DECANTER
BY THE NECK AND FILLED UP THE GLASSES WITH A DARKRED LIQUID IT AROUSED
IN WINSTON DIM MEMORIES OF SOMETHING SEEN LONG AGO ON A WALL OR A
HOARDINGA VAST BOTTLE COMPOSED OF ELECTRIC LIGHTS WHICH SEEMED TO MOVE
UP AND DOWN AND POUR ITS CONTENTS INTO A GLASS SEEN FROM THE TOP THE
STUFF LOOKED ALMOST BLACK BUT IN THE DECANTER IT GLEAMED LIKE A RUBY
IT HAD A SOURSWEET SMELL HE SAW JULIA PICK UP HER GLASS AND SNIFF AT
IT WITH FRANK CURIOSITY

IT IS CALLED WINE SAID OBRIEN WITH A FAINT SMILE YOU WILL HAVE READ
ABOUT IT IN BOOKS NO DOUBT NOT MUCH OF IT GETS TO THE OUTER PARTY I AM
AFRAID HIS FACE GREW SOLEMN AGAIN AND HE RAISED HIS GLASS I THINK IT
IS FITTING THAT WE SHOULD BEGIN BY DRINKING A HEALTH TO OUR LEADER TO
EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN

WINSTON TOOK UP HIS GLASS WITH A CERTAIN EAGERNESS WINE WAS A THING HE
HAD READ AND DREAMED ABOUT LIKE THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT OR MR CHARRINGTONS
HALFREMEMBERED RHYMES IT BELONGED TO THE VANISHED ROMANTIC PAST THE
OLDEN TIME AS HE LIKED TO CALL IT IN HIS SECRET THOUGHTS FOR SOME REASON
HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF WINE AS HAVING AN INTENSELY SWEET TASTE LIKE
THAT OF BLACKBERRY JAM AND AN IMMEDIATE INTOXICATING EFFECT ACTUALLY
WHEN HE CAME TO SWALLOW IT THE STUFF WAS DISTINCTLY DISAPPOINTING THE
TRUTH WAS THAT AFTER YEARS OF GINDRINKING HE COULD BARELY TASTE IT HE
SET DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS

THEN THERE IS SUCH A PERSON AS GOLDSTEIN HE SAID

YES THERE IS SUCH A PERSON AND HE IS ALIVE WHERE I DO NOT KNOW

AND THE CONSPIRACYTHE ORGANIZATION IS IT REAL IT IS NOT SIMPLY AN
INVENTION OF THE THOUGHT POLICE

NO IT IS REAL THE BROTHERHOOD WE CALL IT YOU WILL NEVER LEARN MUCH
MORE ABOUT THE BROTHERHOOD THAN THAT IT EXISTS AND THAT YOU BELONG TO IT
I WILL COME BACK TO THAT PRESENTLY HE LOOKED AT HIS WRISTWATCH IT IS
UNWISE EVEN FOR MEMBERS OF THE INNER PARTY TO TURN OFF THE TELESCREEN FOR
MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE COME HERE TOGETHER AND
YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAVE SEPARATELY YOU COMRADEHE BOWED HIS HEAD TO
JULIAWILL LEAVE FIRST WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AT OUR DISPOSAL
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I MUST START BY ASKING YOU CERTAIN QUESTIONS
IN GENERAL TERMS WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO

ANYTHING THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF SAID WINSTON

OBRIEN HAD TURNED HIMSELF A LITTLE IN HIS CHAIR SO THAT HE WAS FACING
WINSTON HE ALMOST IGNORED JULIA SEEMING TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT
WINSTON COULD SPEAK FOR HER FOR A MOMENT THE LIDS FLITTED DOWN OVER HIS
EYES HE BEGAN ASKING HIS QUESTIONS IN A LOW EXPRESSIONLESS VOICE AS
THOUGH THIS WERE A ROUTINE A SORT OF CATECHISM MOST OF WHOSE ANSWERS
WERE KNOWN TO HIM ALREADY

YOU ARE PREPARED TO GIVE YOUR LIVES

YES

YOU ARE PREPARED TO COMMIT MURDER

YES

TO COMMIT ACTS OF SABOTAGE WHICH MAY CAUSE THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF
INNOCENT PEOPLE

YES

TO BETRAY YOUR COUNTRY TO FOREIGN POWERS

YES

YOU ARE PREPARED TO CHEAT TO FORGE TO BLACKMAIL TO CORRUPT THE MINDS
OF CHILDREN TO DISTRIBUTE HABITFORMING DRUGS TO ENCOURAGE PROSTITUTION
TO DISSEMINATE VENEREAL DISEASESTO DO ANYTHING WHICH IS LIKELY TO CAUSE
DEMORALIZATION AND WEAKEN THE POWER OF THE PARTY

YES

IF FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD SOMEHOW SERVE OUR INTERESTS TO THROW SULPHURIC
ACID IN A CHILDS FACEARE YOU PREPARED TO DO THAT

YES

YOU ARE PREPARED TO LOSE YOUR IDENTITY AND LIVE OUT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AS A WAITER OR A DOCKWORKER

YES

YOU ARE PREPARED TO COMMIT SUICIDE IF AND WHEN WE ORDER YOU TO DO SO

YES

YOU ARE PREPARED THE TWO OF YOU TO SEPARATE AND NEVER SEE ONE ANOTHER
AGAIN

NO BROKE IN JULIA

IT APPEARED TO WINSTON THAT A LONG TIME PASSED BEFORE HE ANSWERED FOR A
MOMENT HE SEEMED EVEN TO HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE POWER OF SPEECH HIS
TONGUE WORKED SOUNDLESSLY FORMING THE OPENING SYLLABLES FIRST OF ONE WORD
THEN OF THE OTHER OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL HE HAD SAID IT HE DID NOT
KNOW WHICH WORD HE WAS GOING TO SAY NO HE SAID FINALLY

YOU DID WELL TO TELL ME SAID OBRIEN IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO KNOW
EVERYTHING

HE TURNED HIMSELF TOWARD JULIA AND ADDED IN A VOICE WITH SOMEWHAT MORE
EXPRESSION IN IT

DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IF HE SURVIVES IT MAY BE AS A DIFFERENT
PERSON WE MAY BE OBLIGED TO GIVE HIM A NEW IDENTITY HIS FACE HIS
MOVEMENTS THE SHAPE OF HIS HANDS THE COLOUR OF HIS HAIREVEN HIS VOICE
WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND YOU YOURSELF MIGHT HAVE BECOME A DIFFERENT PERSON
OUR SURGEONS CAN ALTER PEOPLE BEYOND RECOGNITION SOMETIMES IT IS
NECESSARY SOMETIMES WE EVEN AMPUTATE A LIMB

WINSTON COULD NOT HELP SNATCHING ANOTHER SIDELONG GLANCE AT MARTINS
MONGOLIAN FACE THERE WERE NO SCARS THAT HE COULD SEE JULIA HAD TURNED A
SHADE PALER SO THAT HER FRECKLES WERE SHOWING BUT SHE FACED OBRIEN
BOLDLY SHE MURMURED SOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO BE ASSENT

GOOD THEN THAT IS SETTLED

THERE WAS A SILVER BOX OF CIGARETTES ON THE TABLE WITH A RATHER
ABSENTMINDED AIR OBRIEN PUSHED THEM TOWARDS THE OTHERS TOOK ONE HIMSELF
THEN STOOD UP AND BEGAN TO PACE SLOWLY TO AND FRO AS THOUGH HE COULD THINK
BETTER STANDING THEY WERE VERY GOOD CIGARETTES VERY THICK AND
WELLPACKED WITH AN UNFAMILIAR SILKINESS IN THE PAPER OBRIEN LOOKED AT
HIS WRISTWATCH AGAIN

YOU HAD BETTER GO BACK TO YOUR PANTRY MARTIN HE SAID I SHALL SWITCH
ON IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THESE COMRADES FACES
BEFORE YOU GO YOU WILL BE SEEING THEM AGAIN I MAY NOT

EXACTLY AS THEY HAD DONE AT THE FRONT DOOR THE LITTLE MANS DARK EYES
FLICKERED OVER THEIR FACES THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FRIENDLINESS IN HIS
MANNER HE WAS MEMORIZING THEIR APPEARANCE BUT HE FELT NO INTEREST IN
THEM OR APPEARED TO FEEL NONE IT OCCURRED TO WINSTON THAT A SYNTHETIC
FACE WAS PERHAPS INCAPABLE OF CHANGING ITS EXPRESSION WITHOUT SPEAKING
OR GIVING ANY KIND OF SALUTATION MARTIN WENT OUT CLOSING THE DOOR
SILENTLY BEHIND HIM OBRIEN WAS STROLLING UP AND DOWN ONE HAND IN THE
POCKET OF HIS BLACK OVERALLS THE OTHER HOLDING HIS CIGARETTE

YOU UNDERSTAND HE SAID THAT YOU WILL BE FIGHTING IN THE DARK YOU
WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE DARK YOU WILL RECEIVE ORDERS AND YOU WILL OBEY THEM
WITHOUT KNOWING WHY LATER I SHALL SEND YOU A BOOK FROM WHICH YOU WILL
LEARN THE TRUE NATURE OF THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN AND THE STRATEGY BY WHICH
WE SHALL DESTROY IT WHEN YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK YOU WILL BE FULL MEMBERS
OF THE BROTHERHOOD BUT BETWEEN THE GENERAL AIMS THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR
AND THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE MOMENT YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ANYTHING I
TELL YOU THAT THE BROTHERHOOD EXISTS BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU WHETHER IT
NUMBERS A HUNDRED MEMBERS OR TEN MILLION FROM YOUR PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IT NUMBERS EVEN AS MANY AS A DOZEN YOU
WILL HAVE THREE OR FOUR CONTACTS WHO WILL BE RENEWED FROM TIME TO TIME AS
THEY DISAPPEAR AS THIS WAS YOUR FIRST CONTACT IT WILL BE PRESERVED WHEN
YOU RECEIVE ORDERS THEY WILL COME FROM ME IF WE FIND IT NECESSARY TO
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU IT WILL BE THROUGH MARTIN WHEN YOU ARE FINALLY
CAUGHT YOU WILL CONFESS THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE BUT YOU WILL HAVE VERY
LITTLE TO CONFESS OTHER THAN YOUR OWN ACTIONS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
BETRAY MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF UNIMPORTANT PEOPLE PROBABLY YOU WILL NOT
EVEN BETRAY ME BY THAT TIME I MAY BE DEAD OR I SHALL HAVE BECOME A
DIFFERENT PERSON WITH A DIFFERENT FACE

HE CONTINUED TO MOVE TO AND FRO OVER THE SOFT CARPET IN SPITE OF THE
BULKINESS OF HIS BODY THERE WAS A REMARKABLE GRACE IN HIS MOVEMENTS IT
CAME OUT EVEN IN THE GESTURE WITH WHICH HE THRUST A HAND INTO HIS POCKET
OR MANIPULATED A CIGARETTE MORE EVEN THAN OF STRENGTH HE GAVE AN
IMPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE AND OF AN UNDERSTANDING TINGED BY IRONY HOWEVER
MUCH IN EARNEST HE MIGHT BE HE HAD NOTHING OF THE SINGLEMINDEDNESS THAT
BELONGS TO A FANATIC WHEN HE SPOKE OF MURDER SUICIDE VENEREAL DISEASE
AMPUTATED LIMBS AND ALTERED FACES IT WAS WITH A FAINT AIR OF PERSIFLAGE
THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE HIS VOICE SEEMED TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE GOT
TO DO UNFLINCHINGLY BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT WE SHALL BE DOING WHEN LIFE IS
WORTH LIVING AGAIN A WAVE OF ADMIRATION ALMOST OF WORSHIP FLOWED OUT
FROM WINSTON TOWARDS OBRIEN FOR THE MOMENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE SHADOWY
FIGURE OF GOLDSTEIN WHEN YOU LOOKED AT OBRIENS POWERFUL SHOULDERS AND
HIS BLUNTFEATURED FACE SO UGLY AND YET SO CIVILIZED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO BELIEVE THAT HE COULD BE DEFEATED THERE WAS NO STRATAGEM THAT HE WAS
NOT EQUAL TO NO DANGER THAT HE COULD NOT FORESEE EVEN JULIA SEEMED TO
BE IMPRESSED SHE HAD LET HER CIGARETTE GO OUT AND WAS LISTENING INTENTLY
OBRIEN WENT ON

YOU WILL HAVE HEARD RUMOURS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE BROTHERHOOD NO DOUBT
YOU HAVE FORMED YOUR OWN PICTURE OF IT YOU HAVE IMAGINED PROBABLY A
HUGE UNDERWORLD OF CONSPIRATORS MEETING SECRETLY IN CELLARS SCRIBBLING
MESSAGES ON WALLS RECOGNIZING ONE ANOTHER BY CODEWORDS OR BY SPECIAL
MOVEMENTS OF THE HAND NOTHING OF THE KIND EXISTS THE MEMBERS OF THE
BROTHERHOOD HAVE NO WAY OF RECOGNIZING ONE ANOTHER AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ANY ONE MEMBER TO BE AWARE OF THE IDENTITY OF MORE THAN A FEW OTHERS
GOLDSTEIN HIMSELF IF HE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE THOUGHT POLICE COULD
NOT GIVE THEM A COMPLETE LIST OF MEMBERS OR ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD
LEAD THEM TO A COMPLETE LIST NO SUCH LIST EXISTS THE BROTHERHOOD CANNOT
BE WIPED OUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN ORGANIZATION IN THE ORDINARY SENSE
NOTHING HOLDS IT TOGETHER EXCEPT AN IDEA WHICH IS INDESTRUCTIBLE YOU
WILL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO SUSTAIN YOU EXCEPT THE IDEA YOU WILL GET NO
COMRADESHIP AND NO ENCOURAGEMENT WHEN FINALLY YOU ARE CAUGHT YOU WILL
GET NO HELP WE NEVER HELP OUR MEMBERS AT MOST WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE SILENCED WE ARE OCCASIONALLY ABLE TO
SMUGGLE A RAZOR BLADE INTO A PRISONERS CELL YOU WILL HAVE TO GET USED
TO LIVING WITHOUT RESULTS AND WITHOUT HOPE YOU WILL WORK FOR A WHILE
YOU WILL BE CAUGHT YOU WILL CONFESS AND THEN YOU WILL DIE THOSE ARE
THE ONLY RESULTS THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT ANY
PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE WILL HAPPEN WITHIN OUR OWN LIFETIME WE ARE THE DEAD
OUR ONLY TRUE LIFE IS IN THE FUTURE WE SHALL TAKE PART IN IT AS HANDFULS
OF DUST AND SPLINTERS OF BONE BUT HOW FAR AWAY THAT FUTURE MAY BE THERE
IS NO KNOWING IT MIGHT BE A THOUSAND YEARS AT PRESENT NOTHING IS POSSIBLE
EXCEPT TO EXTEND THE AREA OF SANITY LITTLE BY LITTLE WE CANNOT ACT
COLLECTIVELY WE CAN ONLY SPREAD OUR KNOWLEDGE OUTWARDS FROM INDIVIDUAL TO
INDIVIDUAL GENERATION AFTER GENERATION IN THE FACE OF THE THOUGHT POLICE
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY

HE HALTED AND LOOKED FOR THE THIRD TIME AT HIS WRISTWATCH

IT IS ALMOST TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE COMRADE HE SAID TO JULIA WAIT
THE DECANTER IS STILL HALF FULL

HE FILLED THE GLASSES AND RAISED HIS OWN GLASS BY THE STEM

WHAT SHALL IT BE THIS TIME HE SAID STILL WITH THE SAME FAINT
SUGGESTION OF IRONY TO THE CONFUSION OF THE THOUGHT POLICE TO THE
DEATH OF BIG BROTHER TO HUMANITY TO THE FUTURE

TO THE PAST SAID WINSTON

THE PAST IS MORE IMPORTANT AGREED OBRIEN GRAVELY

THEY EMPTIED THEIR GLASSES AND A MOMENT LATER JULIA STOOD UP TO GO
OBRIEN TOOK A SMALL BOX FROM THE TOP OF A CABINET AND HANDED HER A FLAT
WHITE TABLET WHICH HE TOLD HER TO PLACE ON HER TONGUE IT WAS IMPORTANT
HE SAID NOT TO GO OUT SMELLING OF WINE THE LIFT ATTENDANTS WERE VERY
OBSERVANT AS SOON AS THE DOOR HAD SHUT BEHIND HER HE APPEARED TO FORGET
HER EXISTENCE HE TOOK ANOTHER PACE OR TWO UP AND DOWN THEN STOPPED

THERE ARE DETAILS TO BE SETTLED HE SAID I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE A
HIDINGPLACE OF SOME KIND

WINSTON EXPLAINED ABOUT THE ROOM OVER MR CHARRINGTONS SHOP

THAT WILL DO FOR THE MOMENT LATER WE WILL ARRANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU
IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHANGE ONES HIDINGPLACE FREQUENTLY MEANWHILE I SHALL
SEND YOU A COPY OF THE BOOKEVEN OBRIEN WINSTON NOTICED SEEMED TO
PRONOUNCE THE WORDS AS THOUGH THEY WERE IN ITALICSGOLDSTEINS BOOK YOU
UNDERSTAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT MAY BE SOME DAYS BEFORE I CAN GET HOLD
OF ONE THERE ARE NOT MANY IN EXISTENCE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE THOUGHT
POLICE HUNT THEM DOWN AND DESTROY THEM ALMOST AS FAST AS WE CAN PRODUCE
THEM IT MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE THE BOOK IS INDESTRUCTIBLE IF
THE LAST COPY WERE GONE WE COULD REPRODUCE IT ALMOST WORD FOR WORD DO
YOU CARRY A BRIEFCASE TO WORK WITH YOU HE ADDED

AS A RULE YES

WHAT IS IT LIKE

BLACK VERY SHABBY WITH TWO STRAPS

BLACK TWO STRAPS VERY SHABBYGOOD ONE DAY IN THE FAIRLY NEAR
FUTUREI CANNOT GIVE A DATEONE OF THE MESSAGES AMONG YOUR MORNINGS
WORK WILL CONTAIN A MISPRINTED WORD AND YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK FOR A
REPEAT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY YOU WILL GO TO WORK WITHOUT YOUR BRIEFCASE
AT SOME TIME DURING THE DAY IN THE STREET A MAN WILL TOUCH YOU ON THE
ARM AND SAY I THINK YOU HAVE DROPPED YOUR BRIEFCASE THE ONE HE GIVES
YOU WILL CONTAIN A COPY OF GOLDSTEINS BOOK YOU WILL RETURN IT WITHIN
FOURTEEN DAYS

THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE YOU NEED GO SAID OBRIEN WE
SHALL MEET AGAINIF WE DO MEET AGAIN

WINSTON LOOKED UP AT HIM IN THE PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO DARKNESS
HE SAID HESITANTLY

OBRIEN NODDED WITHOUT APPEARANCE OF SURPRISE IN THE PLACE WHERE THERE
IS NO DARKNESS HE SAID AS THOUGH HE HAD RECOGNIZED THE ALLUSION AND
IN THE MEANTIME IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO SAY BEFORE YOU LEAVE
ANY MESSAGE ANY QUESTION

WINSTON THOUGHT THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY FURTHER QUESTION THAT HE
WANTED TO ASK STILL LESS DID HE FEEL ANY IMPULSE TO UTTER HIGHSOUNDING
GENERALITIES INSTEAD OF ANYTHING DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH OBRIEN OR THE
BROTHERHOOD THERE CAME INTO HIS MIND A SORT OF COMPOSITE PICTURE OF THE
DARK BEDROOM WHERE HIS MOTHER HAD SPENT HER LAST DAYS AND THE LITTLE ROOM
OVER MR CHARRINGTONS SHOP AND THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT AND THE STEEL
ENGRAVING IN ITS ROSEWOOD FRAME ALMOST AT RANDOM HE SAID

DID YOU EVER HAPPEN TO HEAR AN OLD RHYME THAT BEGINS ORANGES AND LEMONS
SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS

AGAIN OBRIEN NODDED WITH A SORT OF GRAVE COURTESY HE COMPLETED THE
STANZA


ORANGES AND LEMONS SAY THE BELLS OF ST CLEMENTS
YOU OWE ME THREE FARTHINGS SAY THE BELLS OF ST MARTINS
WHEN WILL YOU PAY ME SAY THE BELLS OF OLD BAILEY
WHEN I GROW RICH SAY THE BELLS OF SHOREDITCH


YOU KNEW THE LAST LINE SAID WINSTON

YES I KNEW THE LAST LINE AND NOW I AM AFRAID IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO
BUT WAIT YOU HAD BETTER LET ME GIVE YOU ONE OF THESE TABLETS

AS WINSTON STOOD UP OBRIEN HELD OUT A HAND HIS POWERFUL GRIP CRUSHED
THE BONES OF WINSTONS PALM AT THE DOOR WINSTON LOOKED BACK BUT OBRIEN
SEEMED ALREADY TO BE IN PROCESS OF PUTTING HIM OUT OF MIND HE WAS WAITING
WITH HIS HAND ON THE SWITCH THAT CONTROLLED THE TELESCREEN BEYOND HIM
WINSTON COULD SEE THE WRITINGTABLE WITH ITS GREENSHADED LAMP AND THE
SPEAKWRITE AND THE WIRE BASKETS DEEPLADEN WITH PAPERS THE INCIDENT WAS
CLOSED WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS IT OCCURRED TO HIM OBRIEN WOULD BE BACK
AT HIS INTERRUPTED AND IMPORTANT WORK ON BEHALF OF THE PARTY




CHAPTER 9



WINSTON WAS GELATINOUS WITH FATIGUE GELATINOUS WAS THE RIGHT WORD IT HAD
COME INTO HIS HEAD SPONTANEOUSLY HIS BODY SEEMED TO HAVE NOT ONLY THE
WEAKNESS OF A JELLY BUT ITS TRANSLUCENCY HE FELT THAT IF HE HELD UP HIS
HAND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE LIGHT THROUGH IT ALL THE BLOOD AND
LYMPH HAD BEEN DRAINED OUT OF HIM BY AN ENORMOUS DEBAUCH OF WORK LEAVING
ONLY A FRAIL STRUCTURE OF NERVES BONES AND SKIN ALL SENSATIONS SEEMED
TO BE MAGNIFIED HIS OVERALLS FRETTED HIS SHOULDERS THE PAVEMENT TICKLED
HIS FEET EVEN THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF A HAND WAS AN EFFORT THAT MADE
HIS JOINTS CREAK

HE HAD WORKED MORE THAN NINETY HOURS IN FIVE DAYS SO HAD EVERYONE ELSE IN
THE MINISTRY NOW IT WAS ALL OVER AND HE HAD LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO NO
PARTY WORK OF ANY DESCRIPTION UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING HE COULD SPEND SIX
HOURS IN THE HIDINGPLACE AND ANOTHER NINE IN HIS OWN BED SLOWLY IN
MILD AFTERNOON SUNSHINE HE WALKED UP A DINGY STREET IN THE DIRECTION
OF MR CHARRINGTONS SHOP KEEPING ONE EYE OPEN FOR THE PATROLS BUT
IRRATIONALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS AFTERNOON THERE WAS NO DANGER OF ANYONE
INTERFERING WITH HIM THE HEAVY BRIEFCASE THAT HE WAS CARRYING BUMPED
AGAINST HIS KNEE AT EACH STEP SENDING A TINGLING SENSATION UP AND DOWN
THE SKIN OF HIS LEG INSIDE IT WAS THE BOOK WHICH HE HAD NOW HAD IN HIS
POSSESSION FOR SIX DAYS AND HAD NOT YET OPENED NOR EVEN LOOKED AT

ON THE SIXTH DAY OF HATE WEEK AFTER THE PROCESSIONS THE SPEECHES THE
SHOUTING THE SINGING THE BANNERS THE POSTERS THE FILMS THE WAXWORKS
THE ROLLING OF DRUMS AND SQUEALING OF TRUMPETS THE TRAMP OF MARCHING FEET
THE GRINDING OF THE CATERPILLARS OF TANKS THE ROAR OF MASSED PLANES
THE BOOMING OF GUNSAFTER SIX DAYS OF THIS WHEN THE GREAT ORGASM WAS
QUIVERING TO ITS CLIMAX AND THE GENERAL HATRED OF EURASIA HAD BOILED UP
INTO SUCH DELIRIUM THAT IF THE CROWD COULD HAVE GOT THEIR HANDS ON THE
2000 EURASIAN WARCRIMINALS WHO WERE TO BE PUBLICLY HANGED ON THE LAST
DAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS THEY WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE TORN THEM TO
PIECESAT JUST THIS MOMENT IT HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT OCEANIA WAS NOT
AFTER ALL AT WAR WITH EURASIA OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EASTASIA EURASIA
WAS AN ALLY

THERE WAS OF COURSE NO ADMISSION THAT ANY CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE MERELY
IT BECAME KNOWN WITH EXTREME SUDDENNESS AND EVERYWHERE AT ONCE THAT
EASTASIA AND NOT EURASIA WAS THE ENEMY WINSTON WAS TAKING PART IN A
DEMONSTRATION IN ONE OF THE CENTRAL LONDON SQUARES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT
HAPPENED IT WAS NIGHT AND THE WHITE FACES AND THE SCARLET BANNERS WERE
LURIDLY FLOODLIT THE SQUARE WAS PACKED WITH SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE
INCLUDING A BLOCK OF ABOUT A THOUSAND SCHOOLCHILDREN IN THE UNIFORM OF THE
SPIES ON A SCARLETDRAPED PLATFORM AN ORATOR OF THE INNER PARTY A SMALL
LEAN MAN WITH DISPROPORTIONATELY LONG ARMS AND A LARGE BALD SKULL OVER
WHICH A FEW LANK LOCKS STRAGGLED WAS HARANGUING THE CROWD A LITTLE
RUMPELSTILTSKIN FIGURE CONTORTED WITH HATRED HE GRIPPED THE NECK OF THE
MICROPHONE WITH ONE HAND WHILE THE OTHER ENORMOUS AT THE END OF A BONY
ARM CLAWED THE AIR MENACINGLY ABOVE HIS HEAD HIS VOICE MADE METALLIC BY
THE AMPLIFIERS BOOMED FORTH AN ENDLESS CATALOGUE OF ATROCITIES MASSACRES
DEPORTATIONS LOOTINGS RAPINGS TORTURE OF PRISONERS BOMBING OF
CIVILIANS LYING PROPAGANDA UNJUST AGGRESSIONS BROKEN TREATIES IT WAS
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LISTEN TO HIM WITHOUT BEING FIRST CONVINCED AND THEN
MADDENED AT EVERY FEW MOMENTS THE FURY OF THE CROWD BOILED OVER AND THE
VOICE OF THE SPEAKER WAS DROWNED BY A WILD BEASTLIKE ROARING THAT ROSE
UNCONTROLLABLY FROM THOUSANDS OF THROATS THE MOST SAVAGE YELLS OF ALL
CAME FROM THE SCHOOLCHILDREN THE SPEECH HAD BEEN PROCEEDING FOR PERHAPS
TWENTY MINUTES WHEN A MESSENGER HURRIED ON TO THE PLATFORM AND A SCRAP OF
PAPER WAS SLIPPED INTO THE SPEAKERS HAND HE UNROLLED AND READ IT WITHOUT
PAUSING IN HIS SPEECH NOTHING ALTERED IN HIS VOICE OR MANNER OR IN THE
CONTENT OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING BUT SUDDENLY THE NAMES WERE DIFFERENT
WITHOUT WORDS SAID A WAVE OF UNDERSTANDING RIPPLED THROUGH THE CROWD
OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EASTASIA THE NEXT MOMENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS
COMMOTION THE BANNERS AND POSTERS WITH WHICH THE SQUARE WAS DECORATED
WERE ALL WRONG QUITE HALF OF THEM HAD THE WRONG FACES ON THEM IT WAS
SABOTAGE THE AGENTS OF GOLDSTEIN HAD BEEN AT WORK THERE WAS A RIOTOUS
INTERLUDE WHILE POSTERS WERE RIPPED FROM THE WALLS BANNERS TORN TO SHREDS
AND TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT THE SPIES PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF ACTIVITY IN
CLAMBERING OVER THE ROOFTOPS AND CUTTING THE STREAMERS THAT FLUTTERED FROM
THE CHIMNEYS BUT WITHIN TWO OR THREE MINUTES IT WAS ALL OVER THE ORATOR
STILL GRIPPING THE NECK OF THE MICROPHONE HIS SHOULDERS HUNCHED FORWARD
HIS FREE HAND CLAWING AT THE AIR HAD GONE STRAIGHT ON WITH HIS SPEECH
ONE MINUTE MORE AND THE FERAL ROARS OF RAGE WERE AGAIN BURSTING FROM THE
CROWD THE HATE CONTINUED EXACTLY AS BEFORE EXCEPT THAT THE TARGET HAD
BEEN CHANGED

THE THING THAT IMPRESSED WINSTON IN LOOKING BACK WAS THAT THE SPEAKER HAD
SWITCHED FROM ONE LINE TO THE OTHER ACTUALLY IN MIDSENTENCE NOT ONLY
WITHOUT A PAUSE BUT WITHOUT EVEN BREAKING THE SYNTAX BUT AT THE MOMENT
HE HAD OTHER THINGS TO PREOCCUPY HIM IT WAS DURING THE MOMENT OF DISORDER
WHILE THE POSTERS WERE BEING TORN DOWN THAT A MAN WHOSE FACE HE DID NOT
SEE HAD TAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID EXCUSE ME I THINK YOUVE
DROPPED YOUR BRIEFCASE HE TOOK THE BRIEFCASE ABSTRACTEDLY WITHOUT
SPEAKING HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE DAYS BEFORE HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
LOOK INSIDE IT THE INSTANT THAT THE DEMONSTRATION WAS OVER HE WENT
STRAIGHT TO THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH THOUGH THE TIME WAS NOW NEARLY
TWENTYTHREE HOURS THE ENTIRE STAFF OF THE MINISTRY HAD DONE LIKEWISE
THE ORDERS ALREADY ISSUING FROM THE TELESCREEN RECALLING THEM TO THEIR
POSTS WERE HARDLY NECESSARY

OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EASTASIA OCEANIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH
EASTASIA A LARGE PART OF THE POLITICAL LITERATURE OF FIVE YEARS WAS NOW
COMPLETELY OBSOLETE REPORTS AND RECORDS OF ALL KINDS NEWSPAPERS BOOKS
PAMPHLETS FILMS SOUNDTRACKS PHOTOGRAPHSALL HAD TO BE RECTIFIED AT
LIGHTNING SPEED ALTHOUGH NO DIRECTIVE WAS EVER ISSUED IT WAS KNOWN THAT
THE CHIEFS OF THE DEPARTMENT INTENDED THAT WITHIN ONE WEEK NO REFERENCE
TO THE WAR WITH EURASIA OR THE ALLIANCE WITH EASTASIA SHOULD REMAIN IN
EXISTENCE ANYWHERE THE WORK WAS OVERWHELMING ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE
THE PROCESSES THAT IT INVOLVED COULD NOT BE CALLED BY THEIR TRUE
NAMES EVERYONE IN THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT WORKED EIGHTEEN HOURS IN THE
TWENTYFOUR WITH TWO THREEHOUR SNATCHES OF SLEEP MATTRESSES WERE BROUGHT
UP FROM THE CELLARS AND PITCHED ALL OVER THE CORRIDORS MEALS CONSISTED OF
SANDWICHES AND VICTORY COFFEE WHEELED ROUND ON TROLLEYS BY ATTENDANTS FROM
THE CANTEEN EACH TIME THAT WINSTON BROKE OFF FOR ONE OF HIS SPELLS OF
SLEEP HE TRIED TO LEAVE HIS DESK CLEAR OF WORK AND EACH TIME THAT HE
CRAWLED BACK STICKYEYED AND ACHING IT WAS TO FIND THAT ANOTHER SHOWER
OF PAPER CYLINDERS HAD COVERED THE DESK LIKE A SNOWDRIFT HALFBURYING THE
SPEAKWRITE AND OVERFLOWING ON TO THE FLOOR SO THAT THE FIRST JOB WAS
ALWAYS TO STACK THEM INTO A NEAT ENOUGH PILE TO GIVE HIM ROOM TO WORK
WHAT WAS WORST OF ALL WAS THAT THE WORK WAS BY NO MEANS PURELY MECHANICAL
OFTEN IT WAS ENOUGH MERELY TO SUBSTITUTE ONE NAME FOR ANOTHER BUT ANY
DETAILED REPORT OF EVENTS DEMANDED CARE AND IMAGINATION EVEN THE
GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE NEEDED IN TRANSFERRING THE WAR FROM ONE
PART OF THE WORLD TO ANOTHER WAS CONSIDERABLE

BY THE THIRD DAY HIS EYES ACHED UNBEARABLY AND HIS SPECTACLES NEEDED WIPING
EVERY FEW MINUTES IT WAS LIKE STRUGGLING WITH SOME CRUSHING PHYSICAL TASK
SOMETHING WHICH ONE HAD THE RIGHT TO REFUSE AND WHICH ONE WAS NEVERTHELESS
NEUROTICALLY ANXIOUS TO ACCOMPLISH IN SO FAR AS HE HAD TIME TO REMEMBER
IT HE WAS NOT TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT EVERY WORD HE MURMURED INTO THE
SPEAKWRITE EVERY STROKE OF HIS INKPENCIL WAS A DELIBERATE LIE HE WAS
AS ANXIOUS AS ANYONE ELSE IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE FORGERY SHOULD BE
PERFECT ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH DAY THE DRIBBLE OF CYLINDERS SLOWED
DOWN FOR AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR NOTHING CAME OUT OF THE TUBE THEN ONE
MORE CYLINDER THEN NOTHING EVERYWHERE AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE WORK
WAS EASING OFF A DEEP AND AS IT WERE SECRET SIGH WENT THROUGH THE
DEPARTMENT A MIGHTY DEED WHICH COULD NEVER BE MENTIONED HAD BEEN
ACHIEVED IT WAS NOW IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY HUMAN BEING TO PROVE BY DOCUMENTARY
EVIDENCE THAT THE WAR WITH EURASIA HAD EVER HAPPENED AT TWELVE HUNDRED IT
WAS UNEXPECTEDLY ANNOUNCED THAT ALL WORKERS IN THE MINISTRY WERE FREE TILL
TOMORROW MORNING WINSTON STILL CARRYING THE BRIEFCASE CONTAINING THE
BOOK WHICH HAD REMAINED BETWEEN HIS FEET WHILE HE WORKED AND UNDER HIS
BODY WHILE HE SLEPT WENT HOME SHAVED HIMSELF AND ALMOST FELL ASLEEP IN
HIS BATH ALTHOUGH THE WATER WAS BARELY MORE THAN TEPID

WITH A SORT OF VOLUPTUOUS CREAKING IN HIS JOINTS HE CLIMBED THE STAIR ABOVE
MR CHARRINGTONS SHOP HE WAS TIRED BUT NOT SLEEPY ANY LONGER HE OPENED
THE WINDOW LIT THE DIRTY LITTLE OILSTOVE AND PUT ON A PAN OF WATER FOR
COFFEE JULIA WOULD ARRIVE PRESENTLY MEANWHILE THERE WAS THE BOOK HE
SAT DOWN IN THE SLUTTISH ARMCHAIR AND UNDID THE STRAPS OF THE BRIEFCASE

A HEAVY BLACK VOLUME AMATEURISHLY BOUND WITH NO NAME OR TITLE ON THE
COVER THE PRINT ALSO LOOKED SLIGHTLY IRREGULAR THE PAGES WERE WORN AT
THE EDGES AND FELL APART EASILY AS THOUGH THE BOOK HAD PASSED THROUGH
MANY HANDS THE INSCRIPTION ON THE TITLEPAGE RAN


THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF
OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM

EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN


WINSTON BEGAN READING


CHAPTER I
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

THROUGHOUT RECORDED TIME AND PROBABLY SINCE THE END OF THE NEOLITHIC AGE
THERE HAVE BEEN THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE HIGH THE MIDDLE
AND THE LOW THEY HAVE BEEN SUBDIVIDED IN MANY WAYS THEY HAVE BORNE
COUNTLESS DIFFERENT NAMES AND THEIR RELATIVE NUMBERS AS WELL AS THEIR
ATTITUDE TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER HAVE VARIED FROM AGE TO AGE BUT THE
ESSENTIAL STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY HAS NEVER ALTERED EVEN AFTER ENORMOUS
UPHEAVALS AND SEEMINGLY IRREVOCABLE CHANGES THE SAME PATTERN HAS ALWAYS
REASSERTED ITSELF JUST AS A GYROSCOPE WILL ALWAYS RETURN TO EQUILIBRIUM
HOWEVER FAR IT IS PUSHED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

THE AIMS OF THESE GROUPS ARE ENTIRELY IRRECONCILABLE


WINSTON STOPPED READING CHIEFLY IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE
WAS READING IN COMFORT AND SAFETY HE WAS ALONE NO TELESCREEN NO EAR AT
THE KEYHOLE NO NERVOUS IMPULSE TO GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER OR COVER THE
PAGE WITH HIS HAND THE SWEET SUMMER AIR PLAYED AGAINST HIS CHEEK FROM
SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY THERE FLOATED THE FAINT SHOUTS OF CHILDREN IN THE ROOM
ITSELF THERE WAS NO SOUND EXCEPT THE INSECT VOICE OF THE CLOCK HE SETTLED
DEEPER INTO THE ARMCHAIR AND PUT HIS FEET UP ON THE FENDER IT WAS BLISS
IT WAS ETERNITY SUDDENLY AS ONE SOMETIMES DOES WITH A BOOK OF WHICH ONE
KNOWS THAT ONE WILL ULTIMATELY READ AND REREAD EVERY WORD HE OPENED IT
AT A DIFFERENT PLACE AND FOUND HIMSELF AT CHAPTER III HE WENT ON READING


CHAPTER III
WAR IS PEACE

THE SPLITTING UP OF THE WORLD INTO THREE GREAT SUPERSTATES WAS AN EVENT
WHICH COULD BE AND INDEED WAS FORESEEN BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH
CENTURY WITH THE ABSORPTION OF EUROPE BY RUSSIA AND OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE
BY THE UNITED STATES TWO OF THE THREE EXISTING POWERS EURASIA AND
OCEANIA WERE ALREADY EFFECTIVELY IN BEING THE THIRD EASTASIA ONLY
EMERGED AS A DISTINCT UNIT AFTER ANOTHER DECADE OF CONFUSED FIGHTING THE
FRONTIERS BETWEEN THE THREE SUPERSTATES ARE IN SOME PLACES ARBITRARY AND
IN OTHERS THEY FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO THE FORTUNES OF WAR BUT IN GENERAL
THEY FOLLOW GEOGRAPHICAL LINES EURASIA COMPRISES THE WHOLE OF THE NORTHERN
PART OF THE EUROPEAN AND ASIATIC LANDMASS FROM PORTUGAL TO THE BERING
STRAIT OCEANIA COMPRISES THE AMERICAS THE ATLANTIC ISLANDS INCLUDING THE
BRITISH ISLES AUSTRALASIA AND THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF AFRICA EASTASIA
SMALLER THAN THE OTHERS AND WITH A LESS DEFINITE WESTERN FRONTIER
COMPRISES CHINA AND THE COUNTRIES TO THE SOUTH OF IT THE JAPANESE ISLANDS
AND A LARGE BUT FLUCTUATING PORTION OF MANCHURIA MONGOLIA AND TIBET

IN ONE COMBINATION OR ANOTHER THESE THREE SUPERSTATES ARE PERMANENTLY AT
WAR AND HAVE BEEN SO FOR THE PAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS WAR HOWEVER IS NO
LONGER THE DESPERATE ANNIHILATING STRUGGLE THAT IT WAS IN THE EARLY
DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT IS A WARFARE OF LIMITED AIMS BETWEEN
COMBATANTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO DESTROY ONE ANOTHER HAVE NO MATERIAL CAUSE
FOR FIGHTING AND ARE NOT DIVIDED BY ANY GENUINE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT EITHER THE CONDUCT OF WAR OR THE PREVAILING
ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT HAS BECOME LESS BLOODTHIRSTY OR MORE CHIVALROUS
ON THE CONTRARY WAR HYSTERIA IS CONTINUOUS AND UNIVERSAL IN ALL COUNTRIES
AND SUCH ACTS AS RAPING LOOTING THE SLAUGHTER OF CHILDREN THE REDUCTION
OF WHOLE POPULATIONS TO SLAVERY AND REPRISALS AGAINST PRISONERS WHICH
EXTEND EVEN TO BOILING AND BURYING ALIVE ARE LOOKED UPON AS NORMAL
AND WHEN THEY ARE COMMITTED BY ONES OWN SIDE AND NOT BY THE ENEMY
MERITORIOUS BUT IN A PHYSICAL SENSE WAR INVOLVES VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF
PEOPLE MOSTLY HIGHLYTRAINED SPECIALISTS AND CAUSES COMPARATIVELY FEW
CASUALTIES THE FIGHTING WHEN THERE IS ANY TAKES PLACE ON THE VAGUE
FRONTIERS WHOSE WHEREABOUTS THE AVERAGE MAN CAN ONLY GUESS AT OR ROUND
THE FLOATING FORTRESSES WHICH GUARD STRATEGIC SPOTS ON THE SEA LANES IN
THE CENTRES OF CIVILIZATION WAR MEANS NO MORE THAN A CONTINUOUS SHORTAGE
OF CONSUMPTION GOODS AND THE OCCASIONAL CRASH OF A ROCKET BOMB WHICH MAY
CAUSE A FEW SCORES OF DEATHS WAR HAS IN FACT CHANGED ITS CHARACTER MORE
EXACTLY THE REASONS FOR WHICH WAR IS WAGED HAVE CHANGED IN THEIR ORDER OF
IMPORTANCE MOTIVES WHICH WERE ALREADY PRESENT TO SOME SMALL EXTENT IN THE
GREAT WARS OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY HAVE NOW BECOME DOMINANT AND
ARE CONSCIOUSLY RECOGNIZED AND ACTED UPON

TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE PRESENT WARFOR IN SPITE OF THE REGROUPING
WHICH OCCURS EVERY FEW YEARS IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME WARONE MUST REALIZE
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO BE DECISIVE NONE OF
THE THREE SUPERSTATES COULD BE DEFINITIVELY CONQUERED EVEN BY THE OTHER
TWO IN COMBINATION THEY ARE TOO EVENLY MATCHED AND THEIR NATURAL DEFENCES
ARE TOO FORMIDABLE EURASIA IS PROTECTED BY ITS VAST LAND SPACES OCEANIA
BY THE WIDTH OF THE ATLANTIC AND THE PACIFIC EASTASIA BY THE FECUNDITY
AND INDUSTRIOUSNESS OF ITS INHABITANTS SECONDLY THERE IS NO LONGER IN
A MATERIAL SENSE ANYTHING TO FIGHT ABOUT WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
SELFCONTAINED ECONOMIES IN WHICH PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION ARE GEARED
TO ONE ANOTHER THE SCRAMBLE FOR MARKETS WHICH WAS A MAIN CAUSE OF
PREVIOUS WARS HAS COME TO AN END WHILE THE COMPETITION FOR RAW MATERIALS
IS NO LONGER A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN ANY CASE EACH OF THE THREE
SUPERSTATES IS SO VAST THAT IT CAN OBTAIN ALMOST ALL THE MATERIALS THAT
IT NEEDS WITHIN ITS OWN BOUNDARIES IN SO FAR AS THE WAR HAS A DIRECT
ECONOMIC PURPOSE IT IS A WAR FOR LABOUR POWER BETWEEN THE FRONTIERS OF
THE SUPERSTATES AND NOT PERMANENTLY IN THE POSSESSION OF ANY OF THEM
THERE LIES A ROUGH QUADRILATERAL WITH ITS CORNERS AT TANGIER BRAZZAVILLE
DARWIN AND HONG KONG CONTAINING WITHIN IT ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE POPULATION
OF THE EARTH IT IS FOR THE POSSESSION OF THESE THICKLYPOPULATED REGIONS
AND OF THE NORTHERN ICECAP THAT THE THREE POWERS ARE CONSTANTLY
STRUGGLING IN PRACTICE NO ONE POWER EVER CONTROLS THE WHOLE OF THE
DISPUTED AREA PORTIONS OF IT ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING HANDS AND IT IS THE
CHANCE OF SEIZING THIS OR THAT FRAGMENT BY A SUDDEN STROKE OF TREACHERY
THAT DICTATES THE ENDLESS CHANGES OF ALIGNMENT

ALL OF THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES CONTAIN VALUABLE MINERALS AND SOME OF
THEM YIELD IMPORTANT VEGETABLE PRODUCTS SUCH AS RUBBER WHICH IN COLDER
CLIMATES IT IS NECESSARY TO SYNTHESIZE BY COMPARATIVELY EXPENSIVE METHODS
BUT ABOVE ALL THEY CONTAIN A BOTTOMLESS RESERVE OF CHEAP LABOUR WHICHEVER
POWER CONTROLS EQUATORIAL AFRICA OR THE COUNTRIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST OR
SOUTHERN INDIA OR THE INDONESIAN ARCHIPELAGO DISPOSES ALSO OF THE BODIES
OF SCORES OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ILLPAID AND HARDWORKING COOLIES
THE INHABITANTS OF THESE AREAS REDUCED MORE OR LESS OPENLY TO THE STATUS
OF SLAVES PASS CONTINUALLY FROM CONQUEROR TO CONQUEROR AND ARE EXPENDED
LIKE SO MUCH COAL OR OIL IN THE RACE TO TURN OUT MORE ARMAMENTS TO CAPTURE
MORE TERRITORY TO CONTROL MORE LABOUR POWER TO TURN OUT MORE ARMAMENTS
TO CAPTURE MORE TERRITORY AND SO ON INDEFINITELY IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT
THE FIGHTING NEVER REALLY MOVES BEYOND THE EDGES OF THE DISPUTED AREAS
THE FRONTIERS OF EURASIA FLOW BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE BASIN OF THE CONGO
AND THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THE ISLANDS OF THE INDIAN
OCEAN AND THE PACIFIC ARE CONSTANTLY BEING CAPTURED AND RECAPTURED BY
OCEANIA OR BY EASTASIA IN MONGOLIA THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN EURASIA AND
EASTASIA IS NEVER STABLE ROUND THE POLE ALL THREE POWERS LAY CLAIM TO
ENORMOUS TERRITORIES WHICH IN FACT ARE LARGELY UNINHABITED AND UNEXPLORED
BUT THE BALANCE OF POWER ALWAYS REMAINS ROUGHLY EVEN AND THE TERRITORY
WHICH FORMS THE HEARTLAND OF EACH SUPERSTATE ALWAYS REMAINS INVIOLATE
MOREOVER THE LABOUR OF THE EXPLOITED PEOPLES ROUND THE EQUATOR IS NOT
REALLY NECESSARY TO THE WORLDS ECONOMY THEY ADD NOTHING TO THE WEALTH OF
THE WORLD SINCE WHATEVER THEY PRODUCE IS USED FOR PURPOSES OF WAR AND
THE OBJECT OF WAGING A WAR IS ALWAYS TO BE IN A BETTER POSITION IN WHICH
TO WAGE ANOTHER WAR BY THEIR LABOUR THE SLAVE POPULATIONS ALLOW THE TEMPO
OF CONTINUOUS WARFARE TO BE SPEEDED UP BUT IF THEY DID NOT EXIST THE
STRUCTURE OF WORLD SOCIETY AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH IT MAINTAINS ITSELF
WOULD NOT BE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT

THE PRIMARY AIM OF MODERN WARFARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF
DOUBLETHINK THIS AIM IS SIMULTANEOUSLY RECOGNIZED AND NOT RECOGNIZED BY
THE DIRECTING BRAINS OF THE INNER PARTY IS TO USE UP THE PRODUCTS OF THE
MACHINE WITHOUT RAISING THE GENERAL STANDARD OF LIVING EVER SINCE THE END
OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE PROBLEM OF WHAT TO DO WITH THE SURPLUS OF
CONSUMPTION GOODS HAS BEEN LATENT IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AT PRESENT WHEN
FEW HUMAN BEINGS EVEN HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT THIS PROBLEM IS OBVIOUSLY NOT
URGENT AND IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BECOME SO EVEN IF NO ARTIFICIAL PROCESSES
OF DESTRUCTION HAD BEEN AT WORK THE WORLD OF TODAY IS A BARE HUNGRY
DILAPIDATED PLACE COMPARED WITH THE WORLD THAT EXISTED BEFORE 1914 AND
STILL MORE SO IF COMPARED WITH THE IMAGINARY FUTURE TO WHICH THE PEOPLE OF
THAT PERIOD LOOKED FORWARD IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THE VISION OF
A FUTURE SOCIETY UNBELIEVABLY RICH LEISURED ORDERLY AND EFFICIENTA
GLITTERING ANTISEPTIC WORLD OF GLASS AND STEEL AND SNOWWHITE CONCRETEWAS
PART OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEARLY EVERY LITERATE PERSON SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY WERE DEVELOPING AT A PRODIGIOUS SPEED AND IT SEEMED NATURAL TO
ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD GO ON DEVELOPING THIS FAILED TO HAPPEN PARTLY
BECAUSE OF THE IMPOVERISHMENT CAUSED BY A LONG SERIES OF WARS AND
REVOLUTIONS PARTLY BECAUSE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS DEPENDED ON
THE EMPIRICAL HABIT OF THOUGHT WHICH COULD NOT SURVIVE IN A STRICTLY
REGIMENTED SOCIETY AS A WHOLE THE WORLD IS MORE PRIMITIVE TODAY THAN IT
WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO CERTAIN BACKWARD AREAS HAVE ADVANCED AND VARIOUS
DEVICES ALWAYS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH WARFARE AND POLICE ESPIONAGE
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT EXPERIMENT AND INVENTION HAVE LARGELY STOPPED
AND THE RAVAGES OF THE ATOMIC WAR OF THE NINETEENFIFTIES HAVE NEVER BEEN
FULLY REPAIRED NEVERTHELESS THE DANGERS INHERENT IN THE MACHINE ARE STILL
THERE FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE MACHINE FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE IT
WAS CLEAR TO ALL THINKING PEOPLE THAT THE NEED FOR HUMAN DRUDGERY AND
THEREFORE TO A GREAT EXTENT FOR HUMAN INEQUALITY HAD DISAPPEARED IF THE
MACHINE WERE USED DELIBERATELY FOR THAT END HUNGER OVERWORK DIRT
ILLITERACY AND DISEASE COULD BE ELIMINATED WITHIN A FEW GENERATIONS
AND IN FACT WITHOUT BEING USED FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE BUT BY A SORT OF
AUTOMATIC PROCESSBY PRODUCING WEALTH WHICH IT WAS SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO DISTRIBUTETHE MACHINE DID RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE
AVERAGE HUMAN BEING VERY GREATLY OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AT
THE END OF THE NINETEENTH AND THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURIES

BUT IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT AN ALLROUND INCREASE IN WEALTH THREATENED THE
DESTRUCTIONINDEED IN SOME SENSE WAS THE DESTRUCTIONOF A HIERARCHICAL
SOCIETY IN A WORLD IN WHICH EVERYONE WORKED SHORT HOURS HAD ENOUGH TO
EAT LIVED IN A HOUSE WITH A BATHROOM AND A REFRIGERATOR AND POSSESSED
A MOTORCAR OR EVEN AN AEROPLANE THE MOST OBVIOUS AND PERHAPS THE MOST
IMPORTANT FORM OF INEQUALITY WOULD ALREADY HAVE DISAPPEARED IF IT ONCE
BECAME GENERAL WEALTH WOULD CONFER NO DISTINCTION IT WAS POSSIBLE NO
DOUBT TO IMAGINE A SOCIETY IN WHICH WEALTH IN THE SENSE OF PERSONAL
POSSESSIONS AND LUXURIES SHOULD BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED WHILE POWER
REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF A SMALL PRIVILEGED CASTE BUT IN PRACTICE SUCH
A SOCIETY COULD NOT LONG REMAIN STABLE FOR IF LEISURE AND SECURITY WERE
ENJOYED BY ALL ALIKE THE GREAT MASS OF HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE NORMALLY
STUPEFIED BY POVERTY WOULD BECOME LITERATE AND WOULD LEARN TO THINK FOR
THEMSELVES AND WHEN ONCE THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY WOULD SOONER OR LATER
REALIZE THAT THE PRIVILEGED MINORITY HAD NO FUNCTION AND THEY WOULD SWEEP
IT AWAY IN THE LONG RUN A HIERARCHICAL SOCIETY WAS ONLY POSSIBLE ON A
BASIS OF POVERTY AND IGNORANCE TO RETURN TO THE AGRICULTURAL PAST AS
SOME THINKERS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY DREAMED OF
DOING WAS NOT A PRACTICABLE SOLUTION IT CONFLICTED WITH THE TENDENCY
TOWARDS MECHANIZATION WHICH HAD BECOME QUASIINSTINCTIVE THROUGHOUT ALMOST
THE WHOLE WORLD AND MOREOVER ANY COUNTRY WHICH REMAINED INDUSTRIALLY
BACKWARD WAS HELPLESS IN A MILITARY SENSE AND WAS BOUND TO BE DOMINATED
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY ITS MORE ADVANCED RIVALS

NOR WAS IT A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION TO KEEP THE MASSES IN POVERTY BY
RESTRICTING THE OUTPUT OF GOODS THIS HAPPENED TO A GREAT EXTENT DURING
THE FINAL PHASE OF CAPITALISM ROUGHLY BETWEEN 1920 AND 1940 THE ECONOMY
OF MANY COUNTRIES WAS ALLOWED TO STAGNATE LAND WENT OUT OF CULTIVATION
CAPITAL EQUIPMENT WAS NOT ADDED TO GREAT BLOCKS OF THE POPULATION WERE
PREVENTED FROM WORKING AND KEPT HALF ALIVE BY STATE CHARITY BUT THIS
TOO ENTAILED MILITARY WEAKNESS AND SINCE THE PRIVATIONS IT INFLICTED
WERE OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY IT MADE OPPOSITION INEVITABLE THE PROBLEM WAS
HOW TO KEEP THE WHEELS OF INDUSTRY TURNING WITHOUT INCREASING THE REAL
WEALTH OF THE WORLD GOODS MUST BE PRODUCED BUT THEY MUST NOT BE
DISTRIBUTED AND IN PRACTICE THE ONLY WAY OF ACHIEVING THIS WAS BY
CONTINUOUS WARFARE

THE ESSENTIAL ACT OF WAR IS DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY OF HUMAN LIVES
BUT OF THE PRODUCTS OF HUMAN LABOUR WAR IS A WAY OF SHATTERING TO PIECES
OR POURING INTO THE STRATOSPHERE OR SINKING IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA
MATERIALS WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE BE USED TO MAKE THE MASSES TOO COMFORTABLE
AND HENCE IN THE LONG RUN TOO INTELLIGENT EVEN WHEN WEAPONS OF WAR ARE
NOT ACTUALLY DESTROYED THEIR MANUFACTURE IS STILL A CONVENIENT WAY OF
EXPENDING LABOUR POWER WITHOUT PRODUCING ANYTHING THAT CAN BE CONSUMED
A FLOATING FORTRESS FOR EXAMPLE HAS LOCKED UP IN IT THE LABOUR THAT
WOULD BUILD SEVERAL HUNDRED CARGOSHIPS ULTIMATELY IT IS SCRAPPED AS
OBSOLETE NEVER HAVING BROUGHT ANY MATERIAL BENEFIT TO ANYBODY AND WITH
FURTHER ENORMOUS LABOURS ANOTHER FLOATING FORTRESS IS BUILT IN PRINCIPLE
THE WAR EFFORT IS ALWAYS SO PLANNED AS TO EAT UP ANY SURPLUS THAT MIGHT
EXIST AFTER MEETING THE BARE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION IN PRACTICE THE NEEDS
OF THE POPULATION ARE ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATED WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE IS
A CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF HALF THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE BUT THIS IS LOOKED ON
AS AN ADVANTAGE IT IS DELIBERATE POLICY TO KEEP EVEN THE FAVOURED GROUPS
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE BRINK OF HARDSHIP BECAUSE A GENERAL STATE OF SCARCITY
INCREASES THE IMPORTANCE OF SMALL PRIVILEGES AND THUS MAGNIFIES THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ONE GROUP AND ANOTHER BY THE STANDARDS OF THE EARLY
TWENTIETH CENTURY EVEN A MEMBER OF THE INNER PARTY LIVES AN AUSTERE
LABORIOUS KIND OF LIFE NEVERTHELESS THE FEW LUXURIES THAT HE DOES ENJOY
HIS LARGE WELLAPPOINTED FLAT THE BETTER TEXTURE OF HIS CLOTHES THE
BETTER QUALITY OF HIS FOOD AND DRINK AND TOBACCO HIS TWO OR THREE
SERVANTS HIS PRIVATE MOTORCAR OR HELICOPTERSET HIM IN A DIFFERENT WORLD
FROM A MEMBER OF THE OUTER PARTY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE OUTER PARTY HAVE
A SIMILAR ADVANTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH THE SUBMERGED MASSES WHOM WE CALL
THE PROLES THE SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE IS THAT OF A BESIEGED CITY WHERE THE
POSSESSION OF A LUMP OF HORSEFLESH MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEALTH AND
POVERTY AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING AT WAR AND
THEREFORE IN DANGER MAKES THE HANDINGOVER OF ALL POWER TO A SMALL CASTE
SEEM THE NATURAL UNAVOIDABLE CONDITION OF SURVIVAL

WAR IT WILL BE SEEN ACCOMPLISHES THE NECESSARY DESTRUCTION BUT
ACCOMPLISHES IT IN A PSYCHOLOGICALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY IN PRINCIPLE IT WOULD
BE QUITE SIMPLE TO WASTE THE SURPLUS LABOUR OF THE WORLD BY BUILDING
TEMPLES AND PYRAMIDS BY DIGGING HOLES AND FILLING THEM UP AGAIN OR EVEN
BY PRODUCING VAST QUANTITIES OF GOODS AND THEN SETTING FIRE TO THEM BUT
THIS WOULD PROVIDE ONLY THE ECONOMIC AND NOT THE EMOTIONAL BASIS FOR A
HIERARCHICAL SOCIETY WHAT IS CONCERNED HERE IS NOT THE MORALE OF MASSES
WHOSE ATTITUDE IS UNIMPORTANT SO LONG AS THEY ARE KEPT STEADILY AT WORK
BUT THE MORALE OF THE PARTY ITSELF EVEN THE HUMBLEST PARTY MEMBER IS
EXPECTED TO BE COMPETENT INDUSTRIOUS AND EVEN INTELLIGENT WITHIN NARROW
LIMITS BUT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD BE A CREDULOUS AND IGNORANT
FANATIC WHOSE PREVAILING MOODS ARE FEAR HATRED ADULATION AND ORGIASTIC
TRIUMPH IN OTHER WORDS IT IS NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE MENTALITY
APPROPRIATE TO A STATE OF WAR IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER THE WAR IS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND SINCE NO DECISIVE VICTORY IS POSSIBLE IT DOES
NOT MATTER WHETHER THE WAR IS GOING WELL OR BADLY ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS
THAT A STATE OF WAR SHOULD EXIST THE SPLITTING OF THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH
THE PARTY REQUIRES OF ITS MEMBERS AND WHICH IS MORE EASILY ACHIEVED IN AN
ATMOSPHERE OF WAR IS NOW ALMOST UNIVERSAL BUT THE HIGHER UP THE RANKS
ONE GOES THE MORE MARKED IT BECOMES IT IS PRECISELY IN THE INNER PARTY
THAT WAR HYSTERIA AND HATRED OF THE ENEMY ARE STRONGEST IN HIS CAPACITY
AS AN ADMINISTRATOR IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY FOR A MEMBER OF THE INNER PARTY
TO KNOW THAT THIS OR THAT ITEM OF WAR NEWS IS UNTRUTHFUL AND HE MAY OFTEN
BE AWARE THAT THE ENTIRE WAR IS SPURIOUS AND IS EITHER NOT HAPPENING OR
IS BEING WAGED FOR PURPOSES QUITE OTHER THAN THE DECLARED ONES BUT SUCH
KNOWLEDGE IS EASILY NEUTRALIZED BY THE TECHNIQUE OF DOUBLETHINK MEANWHILE
NO INNER PARTY MEMBER WAVERS FOR AN INSTANT IN HIS MYSTICAL BELIEF THAT
THE WAR IS REAL AND THAT IT IS BOUND TO END VICTORIOUSLY WITH OCEANIA
THE UNDISPUTED MASTER OF THE ENTIRE WORLD

ALL MEMBERS OF THE INNER PARTY BELIEVE IN THIS COMING CONQUEST AS AN
ARTICLE OF FAITH IT IS TO BE ACHIEVED EITHER BY GRADUALLY ACQUIRING MORE
AND MORE TERRITORY AND SO BUILDING UP AN OVERWHELMING PREPONDERANCE OF
POWER OR BY THE DISCOVERY OF SOME NEW AND UNANSWERABLE WEAPON THE SEARCH
FOR NEW WEAPONS CONTINUES UNCEASINGLY AND IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REMAINING
ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE INVENTIVE OR SPECULATIVE TYPE OF MIND CAN FIND ANY
OUTLET IN OCEANIA AT THE PRESENT DAY SCIENCE IN THE OLD SENSE HAS
ALMOST CEASED TO EXIST IN NEWSPEAK THERE IS NO WORD FOR SCIENCE THE
EMPIRICAL METHOD OF THOUGHT ON WHICH ALL THE SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS OF
THE PAST WERE FOUNDED IS OPPOSED TO THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF
INGSOC AND EVEN TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN ITS PRODUCTS CAN
IN SOME WAY BE USED FOR THE DIMINUTION OF HUMAN LIBERTY IN ALL THE USEFUL
ARTS THE WORLD IS EITHER STANDING STILL OR GOING BACKWARDS THE FIELDS ARE
CULTIVATED WITH HORSEPLOUGHS WHILE BOOKS ARE WRITTEN BY MACHINERY BUT
IN MATTERS OF VITAL IMPORTANCEMEANING IN EFFECT WAR AND POLICE
ESPIONAGETHE EMPIRICAL APPROACH IS STILL ENCOURAGED OR AT LEAST
TOLERATED THE TWO AIMS OF THE PARTY ARE TO CONQUER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF
THE EARTH AND TO EXTINGUISH ONCE AND FOR ALL THE POSSIBILITY OF INDEPENDENT
THOUGHT THERE ARE THEREFORE TWO GREAT PROBLEMS WHICH THE PARTY IS
CONCERNED TO SOLVE ONE IS HOW TO DISCOVER AGAINST HIS WILL WHAT ANOTHER
HUMAN BEING IS THINKING AND THE OTHER IS HOW TO KILL SEVERAL HUNDRED
MILLION PEOPLE IN A FEW SECONDS WITHOUT GIVING WARNING BEFOREHAND IN
SO FAR AS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH STILL CONTINUES THIS IS ITS SUBJECT MATTER
THE SCIENTIST OF TODAY IS EITHER A MIXTURE OF PSYCHOLOGIST AND INQUISITOR
STUDYING WITH REAL ORDINARY MINUTENESS THE MEANING OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
GESTURES AND TONES OF VOICE AND TESTING THE TRUTHPRODUCING EFFECTS OF
DRUGS SHOCK THERAPY HYPNOSIS AND PHYSICAL TORTURE OR HE IS CHEMIST
PHYSICIST OR BIOLOGIST CONCERNED ONLY WITH SUCH BRANCHES OF HIS SPECIAL
SUBJECT AS ARE RELEVANT TO THE TAKING OF LIFE IN THE VAST LABORATORIES
OF THE MINISTRY OF PEACE AND IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS HIDDEN IN THE
BRAZILIAN FORESTS OR IN THE AUSTRALIAN DESERT OR ON LOST ISLANDS OF
THE ANTARCTIC THE TEAMS OF EXPERTS ARE INDEFATIGABLY AT WORK SOME ARE
CONCERNED SIMPLY WITH PLANNING THE LOGISTICS OF FUTURE WARS OTHERS DEVISE
LARGER AND LARGER ROCKET BOMBS MORE AND MORE POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES AND MORE
AND MORE IMPENETRABLE ARMOURPLATING OTHERS SEARCH FOR NEW AND DEADLIER
GASES OR FOR SOLUBLE POISONS CAPABLE OF BEING PRODUCED IN SUCH QUANTITIES
AS TO DESTROY THE VEGETATION OF WHOLE CONTINENTS OR FOR BREEDS OF DISEASE
GERMS IMMUNIZED AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE ANTIBODIES OTHERS STRIVE TO PRODUCE
A VEHICLE THAT SHALL BORE ITS WAY UNDER THE SOIL LIKE A SUBMARINE UNDER
THE WATER OR AN AEROPLANE AS INDEPENDENT OF ITS BASE AS A SAILINGSHIP
OTHERS EXPLORE EVEN REMOTER POSSIBILITIES SUCH AS FOCUSING THE SUNS RAYS
THROUGH LENSES SUSPENDED THOUSANDS OF KILOMETRES AWAY IN SPACE OR
PRODUCING ARTIFICIAL EARTHQUAKES AND TIDAL WAVES BY TAPPING THE HEAT AT
THE EARTHS CENTRE

BUT NONE OF THESE PROJECTS EVER COMES ANYWHERE NEAR REALIZATION AND NONE
OF THE THREE SUPERSTATES EVER GAINS A SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON THE OTHERS
WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE IS THAT ALL THREE POWERS ALREADY POSSESS IN THE
ATOMIC BOMB A WEAPON FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY THAT THEIR PRESENT
RESEARCHES ARE LIKELY TO DISCOVER ALTHOUGH THE PARTY ACCORDING TO ITS
HABIT CLAIMS THE INVENTION FOR ITSELF ATOMIC BOMBS FIRST APPEARED AS
EARLY AS THE NINETEENFORTIES AND WERE FIRST USED ON A LARGE SCALE ABOUT
TEN YEARS LATER AT THAT TIME SOME HUNDREDS OF BOMBS WERE DROPPED ON
INDUSTRIAL CENTRES CHIEFLY IN EUROPEAN RUSSIA WESTERN EUROPE AND
NORTH AMERICA THE EFFECT WAS TO CONVINCE THE RULING GROUPS OF ALL
COUNTRIES THAT A FEW MORE ATOMIC BOMBS WOULD MEAN THE END OF ORGANIZED
SOCIETY AND HENCE OF THEIR OWN POWER THEREAFTER ALTHOUGH NO FORMAL
AGREEMENT WAS EVER MADE OR HINTED AT NO MORE BOMBS WERE DROPPED ALL THREE
POWERS MERELY CONTINUE TO PRODUCE ATOMIC BOMBS AND STORE THEM UP AGAINST
THE DECISIVE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THEY ALL BELIEVE WILL COME SOONER OR LATER
AND MEANWHILE THE ART OF WAR HAS REMAINED ALMOST STATIONARY FOR THIRTY OR
FORTY YEARS HELICOPTERS ARE MORE USED THAN THEY WERE FORMERLY BOMBING
PLANES HAVE BEEN LARGELY SUPERSEDED BY SELFPROPELLED PROJECTILES AND THE
FRAGILE MOVABLE BATTLESHIP HAS GIVEN WAY TO THE ALMOST UNSINKABLE FLOATING
FORTRESS BUT OTHERWISE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE DEVELOPMENT THE TANK THE
SUBMARINE THE TORPEDO THE MACHINE GUN EVEN THE RIFLE AND THE HAND
GRENADE ARE STILL IN USE AND IN SPITE OF THE ENDLESS SLAUGHTERS REPORTED
IN THE PRESS AND ON THE TELESCREENS THE DESPERATE BATTLES OF EARLIER WARS
IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF MEN WERE OFTEN KILLED
IN A FEW WEEKS HAVE NEVER BEEN REPEATED

NONE OF THE THREE SUPERSTATES EVER ATTEMPTS ANY MANOEUVRE WHICH INVOLVES
THE RISK OF SERIOUS DEFEAT WHEN ANY LARGE OPERATION IS UNDERTAKEN IT IS
USUALLY A SURPRISE ATTACK AGAINST AN ALLY THE STRATEGY THAT ALL THREE
POWERS ARE FOLLOWING OR PRETEND TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING
IS THE SAME THE PLAN IS BY A COMBINATION OF FIGHTING BARGAINING AND
WELLTIMED STROKES OF TREACHERY TO ACQUIRE A RING OF BASES COMPLETELY
ENCIRCLING ONE OR OTHER OF THE RIVAL STATES AND THEN TO SIGN A PACT OF
FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT RIVAL AND REMAIN ON PEACEFUL TERMS FOR SO MANY YEARS
AS TO LULL SUSPICION TO SLEEP DURING THIS TIME ROCKETS LOADED WITH ATOMIC
BOMBS CAN BE ASSEMBLED AT ALL THE STRATEGIC SPOTS FINALLY THEY WILL ALL
BE FIRED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH EFFECTS SO DEVASTATING AS TO MAKE RETALIATION
IMPOSSIBLE IT WILL THEN BE TIME TO SIGN A PACT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE
REMAINING WORLDPOWER IN PREPARATION FOR ANOTHER ATTACK THIS SCHEME IT
IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY IS A MERE DAYDREAM IMPOSSIBLE OF REALIZATION
MOREOVER NO FIGHTING EVER OCCURS EXCEPT IN THE DISPUTED AREAS ROUND THE
EQUATOR AND THE POLE NO INVASION OF ENEMY TERRITORY IS EVER UNDERTAKEN
THIS EXPLAINS THE FACT THAT IN SOME PLACES THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN THE
SUPERSTATES ARE ARBITRARY EURASIA FOR EXAMPLE COULD EASILY CONQUER THE
BRITISH ISLES WHICH ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY PART OF EUROPE OR ON THE OTHER
HAND IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR OCEANIA TO PUSH ITS FRONTIERS TO THE RHINE
OR EVEN TO THE VISTULA BUT THIS WOULD VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE FOLLOWED ON
ALL SIDES THOUGH NEVER FORMULATED OF CULTURAL INTEGRITY IF OCEANIA WERE
TO CONQUER THE AREAS THAT USED ONCE TO BE KNOWN AS FRANCE AND GERMANY IT
WOULD BE NECESSARY EITHER TO EXTERMINATE THE INHABITANTS A TASK OF GREAT
PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY OR TO ASSIMILATE A POPULATION OF ABOUT A HUNDRED
MILLION PEOPLE WHO SO FAR AS TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT GOES ARE ROUGHLY ON
THE OCEANIC LEVEL THE PROBLEM IS THE SAME FOR ALL THREE SUPERSTATES
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THEIR STRUCTURE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO
CONTACT WITH FOREIGNERS EXCEPT TO A LIMITED EXTENT WITH WAR PRISONERS
AND COLOURED SLAVES EVEN THE OFFICIAL ALLY OF THE MOMENT IS ALWAYS
REGARDED WITH THE DARKEST SUSPICION WAR PRISONERS APART THE AVERAGE
CITIZEN OF OCEANIA NEVER SETS EYES ON A CITIZEN OF EITHER EURASIA OR
EASTASIA AND HE IS FORBIDDEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES IF HE
WERE ALLOWED CONTACT WITH FOREIGNERS HE WOULD DISCOVER THAT THEY ARE
CREATURES SIMILAR TO HIMSELF AND THAT MOST OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN TOLD ABOUT
THEM IS LIES THE SEALED WORLD IN WHICH HE LIVES WOULD BE BROKEN AND THE
FEAR HATRED AND SELFRIGHTEOUSNESS ON WHICH HIS MORALE DEPENDS MIGHT
EVAPORATE IT IS THEREFORE REALIZED ON ALL SIDES THAT HOWEVER OFTEN PERSIA
OR EGYPT OR JAVA OR CEYLON MAY CHANGE HANDS THE MAIN FRONTIERS MUST
NEVER BE CROSSED BY ANYTHING EXCEPT BOMBS

UNDER THIS LIES A FACT NEVER MENTIONED ALOUD BUT TACITLY UNDERSTOOD AND
ACTED UPON NAMELY THAT THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE IN ALL THREE SUPERSTATES
ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME IN OCEANIA THE PREVAILING PHILOSOPHY IS CALLED
INGSOC IN EURASIA IT IS CALLED NEOBOLSHEVISM AND IN EASTASIA IT IS
CALLED BY A CHINESE NAME USUALLY TRANSLATED AS DEATHWORSHIP BUT PERHAPS
BETTER RENDERED AS OBLITERATION OF THE SELF THE CITIZEN OF OCEANIA IS NOT
ALLOWED TO KNOW ANYTHING OF THE TENETS OF THE OTHER TWO PHILOSOPHIES BUT
HE IS TAUGHT TO EXECRATE THEM AS BARBAROUS OUTRAGES UPON MORALITY AND
COMMON SENSE ACTUALLY THE THREE PHILOSOPHIES ARE BARELY DISTINGUISHABLE
AND THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS WHICH THEY SUPPORT ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE AT ALL
EVERYWHERE THERE IS THE SAME PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURE THE SAME WORSHIP OF
SEMIDIVINE LEADER THE SAME ECONOMY EXISTING BY AND FOR CONTINUOUS
WARFARE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE THREE SUPERSTATES NOT ONLY CANNOT CONQUER
ONE ANOTHER BUT WOULD GAIN NO ADVANTAGE BY DOING SO ON THE CONTRARY
SO LONG AS THEY REMAIN IN CONFLICT THEY PROP ONE ANOTHER UP LIKE THREE
SHEAVES OF CORN AND AS USUAL THE RULING GROUPS OF ALL THREE POWERS ARE
SIMULTANEOUSLY AWARE AND UNAWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING THEIR LIVES ARE
DEDICATED TO WORLD CONQUEST BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THAT IT IS NECESSARY THAT
THE WAR SHOULD CONTINUE EVERLASTINGLY AND WITHOUT VICTORY MEANWHILE THE
FACT THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF CONQUEST MAKES POSSIBLE THE DENIAL OF
REALITY WHICH IS THE SPECIAL FEATURE OF INGSOC AND ITS RIVAL SYSTEMS OF
THOUGHT HERE IT IS NECESSARY TO REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID EARLIER THAT
BY BECOMING CONTINUOUS WAR HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED ITS CHARACTER

IN PAST AGES A WAR ALMOST BY DEFINITION WAS SOMETHING THAT SOONER OR
LATER CAME TO AN END USUALLY IN UNMISTAKABLE VICTORY OR DEFEAT IN THE
PAST ALSO WAR WAS ONE OF THE MAIN INSTRUMENTS BY WHICH HUMAN SOCIETIES
WERE KEPT IN TOUCH WITH PHYSICAL REALITY ALL RULERS IN ALL AGES HAVE TRIED
TO IMPOSE A FALSE VIEW OF THE WORLD UPON THEIR FOLLOWERS BUT THEY COULD
NOT AFFORD TO ENCOURAGE ANY ILLUSION THAT TENDED TO IMPAIR MILITARY
EFFICIENCY SO LONG AS DEFEAT MEANT THE LOSS OF INDEPENDENCE OR SOME OTHER
RESULT GENERALLY HELD TO BE UNDESIRABLE THE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST DEFEAT
HAD TO BE SERIOUS PHYSICAL FACTS COULD NOT BE IGNORED IN PHILOSOPHY OR
RELIGION OR ETHICS OR POLITICS TWO AND TWO MIGHT MAKE FIVE BUT WHEN
ONE WAS DESIGNING A GUN OR AN AEROPLANE THEY HAD TO MAKE FOUR INEFFICIENT
NATIONS WERE ALWAYS CONQUERED SOONER OR LATER AND THE STRUGGLE FOR
EFFICIENCY WAS INIMICAL TO ILLUSIONS MOREOVER TO BE EFFICIENT IT WAS
NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO LEARN FROM THE PAST WHICH MEANT HAVING A FAIRLY
ACCURATE IDEA OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST NEWSPAPERS AND HISTORY
BOOKS WERE OF COURSE ALWAYS COLOURED AND BIASED BUT FALSIFICATION OF
THE KIND THAT IS PRACTISED TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE WAR WAS A
SURE SAFEGUARD OF SANITY AND SO FAR AS THE RULING CLASSES WERE CONCERNED
IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL SAFEGUARDS WHILE WARS COULD BE
WON OR LOST NO RULING CLASS COULD BE COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE

BUT WHEN WAR BECOMES LITERALLY CONTINUOUS IT ALSO CEASES TO BE DANGEROUS
WHEN WAR IS CONTINUOUS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MILITARY NECESSITY
TECHNICAL PROGRESS CAN CEASE AND THE MOST PALPABLE FACTS CAN BE DENIED OR
DISREGARDED AS WE HAVE SEEN RESEARCHES THAT COULD BE CALLED SCIENTIFIC
ARE STILL CARRIED OUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF WAR BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY A
KIND OF DAYDREAMING AND THEIR FAILURE TO SHOW RESULTS IS NOT IMPORTANT
EFFICIENCY EVEN MILITARY EFFICIENCY IS NO LONGER NEEDED NOTHING IS
EFFICIENT IN OCEANIA EXCEPT THE THOUGHT POLICE SINCE EACH OF THE THREE
SUPERSTATES IS UNCONQUERABLE EACH IS IN EFFECT A SEPARATE UNIVERSE WITHIN
WHICH ALMOST ANY PERVERSION OF THOUGHT CAN BE SAFELY PRACTISED REALITY
ONLY EXERTS ITS PRESSURE THROUGH THE NEEDS OF EVERYDAY LIFETHE NEED TO
EAT AND DRINK TO GET SHELTER AND CLOTHING TO AVOID SWALLOWING POISON OR
STEPPING OUT OF TOPSTOREY WINDOWS AND THE LIKE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
AND BETWEEN PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND PHYSICAL PAIN THERE IS STILL A
DISTINCTION BUT THAT IS ALL CUT OFF FROM CONTACT WITH THE OUTER WORLD
AND WITH THE PAST THE CITIZEN OF OCEANIA IS LIKE A MAN IN INTERSTELLAR
SPACE WHO HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHICH DIRECTION IS UP AND WHICH IS DOWN
THE RULERS OF SUCH A STATE ARE ABSOLUTE AS THE PHARAOHS OR THE CAESARS
COULD NOT BE THEY ARE OBLIGED TO PREVENT THEIR FOLLOWERS FROM STARVING
TO DEATH IN NUMBERS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE INCONVENIENT AND THEY ARE OBLIGED
TO REMAIN AT THE SAME LOW LEVEL OF MILITARY TECHNIQUE AS THEIR RIVALS BUT
ONCE THAT MINIMUM IS ACHIEVED THEY CAN TWIST REALITY INTO WHATEVER SHAPE
THEY CHOOSE

THE WAR THEREFORE IF WE JUDGE IT BY THE STANDARDS OF PREVIOUS WARS IS
MERELY AN IMPOSTURE IT IS LIKE THE BATTLES BETWEEN CERTAIN RUMINANT
ANIMALS WHOSE HORNS ARE SET AT SUCH AN ANGLE THAT THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF
HURTING ONE ANOTHER BUT THOUGH IT IS UNREAL IT IS NOT MEANINGLESS IT
EATS UP THE SURPLUS OF CONSUMABLE GOODS AND IT HELPS TO PRESERVE THE
SPECIAL MENTAL ATMOSPHERE THAT A HIERARCHICAL SOCIETY NEEDS WAR IT WILL
BE SEEN IS NOW A PURELY INTERNAL AFFAIR IN THE PAST THE RULING GROUPS
OF ALL COUNTRIES ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT RECOGNIZE THEIR COMMON INTEREST AND
THEREFORE LIMIT THE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF WAR DID FIGHT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER
AND THE VICTOR ALWAYS PLUNDERED THE VANQUISHED IN OUR OWN DAY THEY ARE
NOT FIGHTING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AT ALL THE WAR IS WAGED BY EACH RULING
GROUP AGAINST ITS OWN SUBJECTS AND THE OBJECT OF THE WAR IS NOT TO MAKE
OR PREVENT CONQUESTS OF TERRITORY BUT TO KEEP THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY
INTACT THE VERY WORD WAR THEREFORE HAS BECOME MISLEADING IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT BY BECOMING CONTINUOUS WAR HAS CEASED TO
EXIST THE PECULIAR PRESSURE THAT IT EXERTED ON HUMAN BEINGS BETWEEN THE
NEOLITHIC AGE AND THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY HAS DISAPPEARED AND BEEN
REPLACED BY SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT THE EFFECT WOULD BE MUCH THE SAME
IF THE THREE SUPERSTATES INSTEAD OF FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER SHOULD AGREE
TO LIVE IN PERPETUAL PEACE EACH INVIOLATE WITHIN ITS OWN BOUNDARIES FOR
IN THAT CASE EACH WOULD STILL BE A SELFCONTAINED UNIVERSE FREED FOR EVER
FROM THE SOBERING INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL DANGER A PEACE THAT WAS TRULY
PERMANENT WOULD BE THE SAME AS A PERMANENT WAR THISALTHOUGH THE VAST
MAJORITY OF PARTY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND IT ONLY IN A SHALLOWER SENSEIS THE
INNER MEANING OF THE PARTY SLOGAN WAR IS PEACE


WINSTON STOPPED READING FOR A MOMENT SOMEWHERE IN REMOTE DISTANCE A
ROCKET BOMB THUNDERED THE BLISSFUL FEELING OF BEING ALONE WITH THE
FORBIDDEN BOOK IN A ROOM WITH NO TELESCREEN HAD NOT WORN OFF SOLITUDE
AND SAFETY WERE PHYSICAL SENSATIONS MIXED UP SOMEHOW WITH THE TIREDNESS
OF HIS BODY THE SOFTNESS OF THE CHAIR THE TOUCH OF THE FAINT BREEZE FROM
THE WINDOW THAT PLAYED UPON HIS CHEEK THE BOOK FASCINATED HIM OR MORE
EXACTLY IT REASSURED HIM IN A SENSE IT TOLD HIM NOTHING THAT WAS NEW BUT
THAT WAS PART OF THE ATTRACTION IT SAID WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IF IT
HAD BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SET HIS SCATTERED THOUGHTS IN ORDER IT WAS
THE PRODUCT OF A MIND SIMILAR TO HIS OWN BUT ENORMOUSLY MORE POWERFUL
MORE SYSTEMATIC LESS FEARRIDDEN THE BEST BOOKS HE PERCEIVED ARE THOSE
THAT TELL YOU WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY HE HAD JUST TURNED BACK TO CHAPTER I
WHEN HE HEARD JULIAS FOOTSTEP ON THE STAIR AND STARTED OUT OF HIS CHAIR
TO MEET HER SHE DUMPED HER BROWN TOOLBAG ON THE FLOOR AND FLUNG HERSELF
INTO HIS ARMS IT WAS MORE THAN A WEEK SINCE THEY HAD SEEN ONE ANOTHER

IVE GOT THE BOOK HE SAID AS THEY DISENTANGLED THEMSELVES

OH YOUVE GOT IT GOOD SHE SAID WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST AND ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE OIL STOVE TO MAKE THE COFFEE

THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE SUBJECT UNTIL THEY HAD BEEN IN BED FOR HALF AN
HOUR THE EVENING WAS JUST COOL ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TO PULL UP
THE COUNTERPANE FROM BELOW CAME THE FAMILIAR SOUND OF SINGING AND THE
SCRAPE OF BOOTS ON THE FLAGSTONES THE BRAWNY REDARMED WOMAN WHOM WINSTON
HAD SEEN THERE ON HIS FIRST VISIT WAS ALMOST A FIXTURE IN THE YARD THERE
SEEMED TO BE NO HOUR OF DAYLIGHT WHEN SHE WAS NOT MARCHING TO AND FRO
BETWEEN THE WASHTUB AND THE LINE ALTERNATELY GAGGING HERSELF WITH CLOTHES
PEGS AND BREAKING FORTH INTO LUSTY SONG JULIA HAD SETTLED DOWN ON HER
SIDE AND SEEMED TO BE ALREADY ON THE POINT OF FALLING ASLEEP HE REACHED
OUT FOR THE BOOK WHICH WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR AND SAT UP AGAINST THE
BEDHEAD

WE MUST READ IT HE SAID YOU TOO ALL MEMBERS OF THE BROTHERHOOD HAVE
TO READ IT

YOU READ IT SHE SAID WITH HER EYES SHUT READ IT ALOUD THATS THE
BEST WAY THEN YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME AS YOU GO

THE CLOCKS HANDS SAID SIX MEANING EIGHTEEN THEY HAD THREE OR FOUR HOURS
AHEAD OF THEM HE PROPPED THE BOOK AGAINST HIS KNEES AND BEGAN READING


CHAPTER I
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

THROUGHOUT RECORDED TIME AND PROBABLY SINCE THE END OF THE NEOLITHIC AGE
THERE HAVE BEEN THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE HIGH THE MIDDLE
AND THE LOW THEY HAVE BEEN SUBDIVIDED IN MANY WAYS THEY HAVE BORNE
COUNTLESS DIFFERENT NAMES AND THEIR RELATIVE NUMBERS AS WELL AS THEIR
ATTITUDE TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER HAVE VARIED FROM AGE TO AGE BUT THE
ESSENTIAL STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY HAS NEVER ALTERED EVEN AFTER ENORMOUS
UPHEAVALS AND SEEMINGLY IRREVOCABLE CHANGES THE SAME PATTERN HAS ALWAYS
REASSERTED ITSELF JUST AS A GYROSCOPE WILL ALWAYS RETURN TO EQUILIBRIUM
HOWEVER FAR IT IS PUSHED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER


JULIA ARE YOU AWAKE SAID WINSTON

YES MY LOVE IM LISTENING GO ON ITS MARVELLOUS

HE CONTINUED READING


THE AIMS OF THESE THREE GROUPS ARE ENTIRELY IRRECONCILABLE THE AIM OF
THE HIGH IS TO REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE THE AIM OF THE MIDDLE IS TO CHANGE
PLACES WITH THE HIGH THE AIM OF THE LOW WHEN THEY HAVE AN AIMFOR IT
IS AN ABIDING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LOW THAT THEY ARE TOO MUCH CRUSHED
BY DRUDGERY TO BE MORE THAN INTERMITTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING OUTSIDE
THEIR DAILY LIVESIS TO ABOLISH ALL DISTINCTIONS AND CREATE A SOCIETY IN
WHICH ALL MEN SHALL BE EQUAL THUS THROUGHOUT HISTORY A STRUGGLE WHICH IS
THE SAME IN ITS MAIN OUTLINES RECURS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR LONG PERIODS
THE HIGH SEEM TO BE SECURELY IN POWER BUT SOONER OR LATER THERE ALWAYS
COMES A MOMENT WHEN THEY LOSE EITHER THEIR BELIEF IN THEMSELVES OR THEIR
CAPACITY TO GOVERN EFFICIENTLY OR BOTH THEY ARE THEN OVERTHROWN BY THE
MIDDLE WHO ENLIST THE LOW ON THEIR SIDE BY PRETENDING TO THEM THAT THEY
ARE FIGHTING FOR LIBERTY AND JUSTICE AS SOON AS THEY HAVE REACHED THEIR
OBJECTIVE THE MIDDLE THRUST THE LOW BACK INTO THEIR OLD POSITION OF
SERVITUDE AND THEMSELVES BECOME THE HIGH PRESENTLY A NEW MIDDLE GROUP
SPLITS OFF FROM ONE OF THE OTHER GROUPS OR FROM BOTH OF THEM AND THE
STRUGGLE BEGINS OVER AGAIN OF THE THREE GROUPS ONLY THE LOW ARE NEVER
EVEN TEMPORARILY SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THEIR AIMS IT WOULD BE AN
EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS OF
A MATERIAL KIND EVEN TODAY IN A PERIOD OF DECLINE THE AVERAGE HUMAN
BEING IS PHYSICALLY BETTER OFF THAN HE WAS A FEW CENTURIES AGO BUT NO
ADVANCE IN WEALTH NO SOFTENING OF MANNERS NO REFORM OR REVOLUTION HAS
EVER BROUGHT HUMAN EQUALITY A MILLIMETRE NEARER FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF
THE LOW NO HISTORIC CHANGE HAS EVER MEANT MUCH MORE THAN A CHANGE IN THE
NAME OF THEIR MASTERS

BY THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE RECURRENCE OF THIS PATTERN HAD BECOME
OBVIOUS TO MANY OBSERVERS THERE THEN ROSE SCHOOLS OF THINKERS WHO
INTERPRETED HISTORY AS A CYCLICAL PROCESS AND CLAIMED TO SHOW THAT
INEQUALITY WAS THE UNALTERABLE LAW OF HUMAN LIFE THIS DOCTRINE OF COURSE
HAD ALWAYS HAD ITS ADHERENTS BUT IN THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS NOW PUT
FORWARD THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE PAST THE NEED FOR A
HIERARCHICAL FORM OF SOCIETY HAD BEEN THE DOCTRINE SPECIFICALLY OF THE
HIGH IT HAD BEEN PREACHED BY KINGS AND ARISTOCRATS AND BY THE PRIESTS
LAWYERS AND THE LIKE WHO WERE PARASITICAL UPON THEM AND IT HAD GENERALLY
BEEN SOFTENED BY PROMISES OF COMPENSATION IN AN IMAGINARY WORLD BEYOND THE
GRAVE THE MIDDLE SO LONG AS IT WAS STRUGGLING FOR POWER HAD ALWAYS MADE
USE OF SUCH TERMS AS FREEDOM JUSTICE AND FRATERNITY NOW HOWEVER THE
CONCEPT OF HUMAN BROTHERHOOD BEGAN TO BE ASSAILED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT
YET IN POSITIONS OF COMMAND BUT MERELY HOPED TO BE SO BEFORE LONG IN THE
PAST THE MIDDLE HAD MADE REVOLUTIONS UNDER THE BANNER OF EQUALITY AND
THEN HAD ESTABLISHED A FRESH TYRANNY AS SOON AS THE OLD ONE WAS OVERTHROWN
THE NEW MIDDLE GROUPS IN EFFECT PROCLAIMED THEIR TYRANNY BEFOREHAND
SOCIALISM A THEORY WHICH APPEARED IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY AND WAS
THE LAST LINK IN A CHAIN OF THOUGHT STRETCHING BACK TO THE SLAVE REBELLIONS
OF ANTIQUITY WAS STILL DEEPLY INFECTED BY THE UTOPIANISM OF PAST AGES
BUT IN EACH VARIANT OF SOCIALISM THAT APPEARED FROM ABOUT 1900 ONWARDS THE
AIM OF ESTABLISHING LIBERTY AND EQUALITY WAS MORE AND MORE OPENLY
ABANDONED THE NEW MOVEMENTS WHICH APPEARED IN THE MIDDLE YEARS OF THE
CENTURY INGSOC IN OCEANIA NEOBOLSHEVISM IN EURASIA DEATHWORSHIP AS
IT IS COMMONLY CALLED IN EASTASIA HAD THE CONSCIOUS AIM OF PERPETUATING
UNFREEDOM AND INEQUALITY THESE NEW MOVEMENTS OF COURSE GREW OUT OF THE
OLD ONES AND TENDED TO KEEP THEIR NAMES AND PAY LIPSERVICE TO THEIR
IDEOLOGY BUT THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THEM WAS TO ARREST PROGRESS AND FREEZE
HISTORY AT A CHOSEN MOMENT THE FAMILIAR PENDULUM SWING WAS TO HAPPEN ONCE
MORE AND THEN STOP AS USUAL THE HIGH WERE TO BE TURNED OUT BY THE
MIDDLE WHO WOULD THEN BECOME THE HIGH BUT THIS TIME BY CONSCIOUS
STRATEGY THE HIGH WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR POSITION PERMANENTLY

THE NEW DOCTRINES AROSE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE ACCUMULATION OF HISTORICAL
KNOWLEDGE AND THE GROWTH OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE WHICH HAD HARDLY EXISTED
BEFORE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE CYCLICAL MOVEMENT OF HISTORY WAS NOW
INTELLIGIBLE OR APPEARED TO BE SO AND IF IT WAS INTELLIGIBLE THEN IT
WAS ALTERABLE BUT THE PRINCIPAL UNDERLYING CAUSE WAS THAT AS EARLY
AS THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HUMAN EQUALITY HAD BECOME
TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE IT WAS STILL TRUE THAT MEN WERE NOT EQUAL IN THEIR
NATIVE TALENTS AND THAT FUNCTIONS HAD TO BE SPECIALIZED IN WAYS THAT
FAVOURED SOME INDIVIDUALS AGAINST OTHERS BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY REAL
NEED FOR CLASS DISTINCTIONS OR FOR LARGE DIFFERENCES OF WEALTH IN EARLIER
AGES CLASS DISTINCTIONS HAD BEEN NOT ONLY INEVITABLE BUT DESIRABLE
INEQUALITY WAS THE PRICE OF CIVILIZATION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE
PRODUCTION HOWEVER THE CASE WAS ALTERED EVEN IF IT WAS STILL NECESSARY
FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO DO DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY
FOR THEM TO LIVE AT DIFFERENT SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC LEVELS THEREFORE FROM
THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE NEW GROUPS WHO WERE ON THE POINT OF SEIZING POWER
HUMAN EQUALITY WAS NO LONGER AN IDEAL TO BE STRIVEN AFTER BUT A DANGER TO
BE AVERTED IN MORE PRIMITIVE AGES WHEN A JUST AND PEACEFUL SOCIETY WAS
IN FACT NOT POSSIBLE IT HAD BEEN FAIRLY EASY TO BELIEVE IT THE IDEA OF
AN EARTHLY PARADISE IN WHICH MEN SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER IN A STATE OF
BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT LAWS AND WITHOUT BRUTE LABOUR HAD HAUNTED THE HUMAN
IMAGINATION FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND THIS VISION HAD HAD A CERTAIN HOLD
EVEN ON THE GROUPS WHO ACTUALLY PROFITED BY EACH HISTORICAL CHANGE THE
HEIRS OF THE FRENCH ENGLISH AND AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS HAD PARTLY BELIEVED
IN THEIR OWN PHRASES ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF MAN FREEDOM OF SPEECH EQUALITY
BEFORE THE LAW AND THE LIKE AND HAVE EVEN ALLOWED THEIR CONDUCT TO BE
INFLUENCED BY THEM TO SOME EXTENT BUT BY THE FOURTH DECADE OF THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY ALL THE MAIN CURRENTS OF POLITICAL THOUGHT WERE
AUTHORITARIAN THE EARTHLY PARADISE HAD BEEN DISCREDITED AT EXACTLY THE
MOMENT WHEN IT BECAME REALIZABLE EVERY NEW POLITICAL THEORY BY WHATEVER
NAME IT CALLED ITSELF LED BACK TO HIERARCHY AND REGIMENTATION AND IN THE
GENERAL HARDENING OF OUTLOOK THAT SET IN ROUND ABOUT 1930 PRACTICES WHICH
HAD BEEN LONG ABANDONED IN SOME CASES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARSIMPRISONMENT
WITHOUT TRIAL THE USE OF WAR PRISONERS AS SLAVES PUBLIC EXECUTIONS
TORTURE TO EXTRACT CONFESSIONS THE USE OF HOSTAGES AND THE DEPORTATION
OF WHOLE POPULATIONSNOT ONLY BECAME COMMON AGAIN BUT WERE TOLERATED
AND EVEN DEFENDED BY PEOPLE WHO CONSIDERED THEMSELVES ENLIGHTENED AND
PROGRESSIVE

IT WAS ONLY AFTER A DECADE OF NATIONAL WARS CIVIL WARS REVOLUTIONS AND
COUNTERREVOLUTIONS IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT INGSOC AND ITS RIVALS
EMERGED AS FULLY WORKEDOUT POLITICAL THEORIES BUT THEY HAD BEEN
FORESHADOWED BY THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS GENERALLY CALLED TOTALITARIAN WHICH
HAD APPEARED EARLIER IN THE CENTURY AND THE MAIN OUTLINES OF THE WORLD
WHICH WOULD EMERGE FROM THE PREVAILING CHAOS HAD LONG BEEN OBVIOUS WHAT
KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD CONTROL THIS WORLD HAD BEEN EQUALLY OBVIOUS THE NEW
ARISTOCRACY WAS MADE UP FOR THE MOST PART OF BUREAUCRATS SCIENTISTS
TECHNICIANS TRADEUNION ORGANIZERS PUBLICITY EXPERTS SOCIOLOGISTS
TEACHERS JOURNALISTS AND PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS THESE PEOPLE WHOSE
ORIGINS LAY IN THE SALARIED MIDDLE CLASS AND THE UPPER GRADES OF THE
WORKING CLASS HAD BEEN SHAPED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE BARREN WORLD OF
MONOPOLY INDUSTRY AND CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT AS COMPARED WITH THEIR
OPPOSITE NUMBERS IN PAST AGES THEY WERE LESS AVARICIOUS LESS TEMPTED BY
LUXURY HUNGRIER FOR PURE POWER AND ABOVE ALL MORE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT
THEY WERE DOING AND MORE INTENT ON CRUSHING OPPOSITION THIS LAST
DIFFERENCE WAS CARDINAL BY COMPARISON WITH THAT EXISTING TODAY ALL THE
TYRANNIES OF THE PAST WERE HALFHEARTED AND INEFFICIENT THE RULING GROUPS
WERE ALWAYS INFECTED TO SOME EXTENT BY LIBERAL IDEAS AND WERE CONTENT TO
LEAVE LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE TO REGARD ONLY THE OVERT ACT AND TO BE
UNINTERESTED IN WHAT THEIR SUBJECTS WERE THINKING EVEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
OF THE MIDDLE AGES WAS TOLERANT BY MODERN STANDARDS PART OF THE REASON
FOR THIS WAS THAT IN THE PAST NO GOVERNMENT HAD THE POWER TO KEEP ITS
CITIZENS UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE THE INVENTION OF PRINT HOWEVER
MADE IT EASIER TO MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND THE FILM AND THE RADIO
CARRIED THE PROCESS FURTHER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELEVISION AND
THE TECHNICAL ADVANCE WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO RECEIVE AND TRANSMIT
SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE SAME INSTRUMENT PRIVATE LIFE CAME TO AN END EVERY
CITIZEN OR AT LEAST EVERY CITIZEN IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE WORTH WATCHING
COULD BE KEPT FOR TWENTYFOUR HOURS A DAY UNDER THE EYES OF THE POLICE
AND IN THE SOUND OF OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA WITH ALL OTHER CHANNELS OF
COMMUNICATION CLOSED THE POSSIBILITY OF ENFORCING NOT ONLY COMPLETE
OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL OF THE STATE BUT COMPLETE UNIFORMITY OF OPINION
ON ALL SUBJECTS NOW EXISTED FOR THE FIRST TIME

AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD OF THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES SOCIETY
REGROUPED ITSELF AS ALWAYS INTO HIGH MIDDLE AND LOW BUT THE NEW HIGH
GROUP UNLIKE ALL ITS FORERUNNERS DID NOT ACT UPON INSTINCT BUT KNEW WHAT
WAS NEEDED TO SAFEGUARD ITS POSITION IT HAD LONG BEEN REALIZED THAT THE
ONLY SECURE BASIS FOR OLIGARCHY IS COLLECTIVISM WEALTH AND PRIVILEGE
ARE MOST EASILY DEFENDED WHEN THEY ARE POSSESSED JOINTLY THE SOCALLED
ABOLITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE MIDDLE YEARS OF
THE CENTURY MEANT IN EFFECT THE CONCENTRATION OF PROPERTY IN FAR FEWER
HANDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE NEW OWNERS WERE A
GROUP INSTEAD OF A MASS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALLY NO MEMBER OF THE
PARTY OWNS ANYTHING EXCEPT PETTY PERSONAL BELONGINGS COLLECTIVELY THE
PARTY OWNS EVERYTHING IN OCEANIA BECAUSE IT CONTROLS EVERYTHING AND
DISPOSES OF THE PRODUCTS AS IT THINKS FIT IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE
REVOLUTION IT WAS ABLE TO STEP INTO THIS COMMANDING POSITION ALMOST
UNOPPOSED BECAUSE THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS REPRESENTED AS AN ACT OF
COLLECTIVIZATION IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASSUMED THAT IF THE CAPITALIST CLASS
WERE EXPROPRIATED SOCIALISM MUST FOLLOW AND UNQUESTIONABLY THE
CAPITALISTS HAD BEEN EXPROPRIATED FACTORIES MINES LAND HOUSES
TRANSPORTEVERYTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND SINCE THESE
THINGS WERE NO LONGER PRIVATE PROPERTY IT FOLLOWED THAT THEY MUST BE
PUBLIC PROPERTY INGSOC WHICH GREW OUT OF THE EARLIER SOCIALIST MOVEMENT
AND INHERITED ITS PHRASEOLOGY HAS IN FACT CARRIED OUT THE MAIN ITEM IN
THE SOCIALIST PROGRAMME WITH THE RESULT FORESEEN AND INTENDED BEFOREHAND
THAT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY HAS BEEN MADE PERMANENT

BUT THE PROBLEMS OF PERPETUATING A HIERARCHICAL SOCIETY GO DEEPER THAN
THIS THERE ARE ONLY FOUR WAYS IN WHICH A RULING GROUP CAN FALL FROM POWER
EITHER IT IS CONQUERED FROM WITHOUT OR IT GOVERNS SO INEFFICIENTLY THAT
THE MASSES ARE STIRRED TO REVOLT OR IT ALLOWS A STRONG AND DISCONTENTED
MIDDLE GROUP TO COME INTO BEING OR IT LOSES ITS OWN SELFCONFIDENCE AND
WILLINGNESS TO GOVERN THESE CAUSES DO NOT OPERATE SINGLY AND AS A RULE
ALL FOUR OF THEM ARE PRESENT IN SOME DEGREE A RULING CLASS WHICH COULD
GUARD AGAINST ALL OF THEM WOULD REMAIN IN POWER PERMANENTLY ULTIMATELY
THE DETERMINING FACTOR IS THE MENTAL ATTITUDE OF THE RULING CLASS ITSELF

AFTER THE MIDDLE OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THE FIRST DANGER HAD IN REALITY
DISAPPEARED EACH OF THE THREE POWERS WHICH NOW DIVIDE THE WORLD IS IN
FACT UNCONQUERABLE AND COULD ONLY BECOME CONQUERABLE THROUGH SLOW
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES WHICH A GOVERNMENT WITH WIDE POWERS CAN EASILY AVERT
THE SECOND DANGER ALSO IS ONLY A THEORETICAL ONE THE MASSES NEVER
REVOLT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND THEY NEVER REVOLT MERELY BECAUSE THEY ARE
OPPRESSED INDEED SO LONG AS THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE STANDARDS OF
COMPARISON THEY NEVER EVEN BECOME AWARE THAT THEY ARE OPPRESSED THE
RECURRENT ECONOMIC CRISES OF PAST TIMES WERE TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND ARE
NOT NOW PERMITTED TO HAPPEN BUT OTHER AND EQUALLY LARGE DISLOCATIONS
CAN AND DO HAPPEN WITHOUT HAVING POLITICAL RESULTS BECAUSE THERE IS NO
WAY IN WHICH DISCONTENT CAN BECOME ARTICULATE AS FOR THE PROBLEM OF
OVERPRODUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN LATENT IN OUR SOCIETY SINCE THE DEVELOPMENT
OF MACHINE TECHNIQUE IT IS SOLVED BY THE DEVICE OF CONTINUOUS WARFARE
SEE CHAPTER III WHICH IS ALSO USEFUL IN KEYING UP PUBLIC MORALE TO THE
NECESSARY PITCH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OUR PRESENT RULERS THEREFORE
THE ONLY GENUINE DANGERS ARE THE SPLITTINGOFF OF A NEW GROUP OF ABLE
UNDEREMPLOYED POWERHUNGRY PEOPLE AND THE GROWTH OF LIBERALISM AND
SCEPTICISM IN THEIR OWN RANKS THE PROBLEM THAT IS TO SAY IS EDUCATIONAL
IT IS A PROBLEM OF CONTINUOUSLY MOULDING THE CONSCIOUSNESS BOTH OF THE
DIRECTING GROUP AND OF THE LARGER EXECUTIVE GROUP THAT LIES IMMEDIATELY
BELOW IT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MASSES NEEDS ONLY TO BE INFLUENCED IN
A NEGATIVE WAY

GIVEN THIS BACKGROUND ONE COULD INFER IF ONE DID NOT KNOW IT ALREADY
THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF OCEANIC SOCIETY AT THE APEX OF THE PYRAMID COMES
BIG BROTHER BIG BROTHER IS INFALLIBLE AND ALLPOWERFUL EVERY SUCCESS
EVERY ACHIEVEMENT EVERY VICTORY EVERY SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY ALL
KNOWLEDGE ALL WISDOM ALL HAPPINESS ALL VIRTUE ARE HELD TO ISSUE
DIRECTLY FROM HIS LEADERSHIP AND INSPIRATION NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BIG
BROTHER HE IS A FACE ON THE HOARDINGS A VOICE ON THE TELESCREEN WE
MAY BE REASONABLY SURE THAT HE WILL NEVER DIE AND THERE IS ALREADY
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHEN HE WAS BORN BIG BROTHER IS THE GUISE
IN WHICH THE PARTY CHOOSES TO EXHIBIT ITSELF TO THE WORLD HIS FUNCTION IS
TO ACT AS A FOCUSING POINT FOR LOVE FEAR AND REVERENCE EMOTIONS WHICH
ARE MORE EASILY FELT TOWARDS AN INDIVIDUAL THAN TOWARDS AN ORGANIZATION
BELOW BIG BROTHER COMES THE INNER PARTY ITS NUMBERS LIMITED TO SIX
MILLIONS OR SOMETHING LESS THAN 2 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF OCEANIA
BELOW THE INNER PARTY COMES THE OUTER PARTY WHICH IF THE INNER PARTY IS
DESCRIBED AS THE BRAIN OF THE STATE MAY BE JUSTLY LIKENED TO THE HANDS
BELOW THAT COME THE DUMB MASSES WHOM WE HABITUALLY REFER TO AS THE
PROLES NUMBERING PERHAPS 85 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IN THE TERMS
OF OUR EARLIER CLASSIFICATION THE PROLES ARE THE LOW FOR THE SLAVE
POPULATION OF THE EQUATORIAL LANDS WHO PASS CONSTANTLY FROM CONQUEROR
TO CONQUEROR ARE NOT A PERMANENT OR NECESSARY PART OF THE STRUCTURE

IN PRINCIPLE MEMBERSHIP OF THESE THREE GROUPS IS NOT HEREDITARY THE
CHILD OF INNER PARTY PARENTS IS IN THEORY NOT BORN INTO THE INNER PARTY
ADMISSION TO EITHER BRANCH OF THE PARTY IS BY EXAMINATION TAKEN AT THE
AGE OF SIXTEEN NOR IS THERE ANY RACIAL DISCRIMINATION OR ANY MARKED
DOMINATION OF ONE PROVINCE BY ANOTHER JEWS NEGROES SOUTH AMERICANS OF
PURE INDIAN BLOOD ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE HIGHEST RANKS OF THE PARTY AND
THE ADMINISTRATORS OF ANY AREA ARE ALWAYS DRAWN FROM THE INHABITANTS OF
THAT AREA IN NO PART OF OCEANIA DO THE INHABITANTS HAVE THE FEELING THAT
THEY ARE A COLONIAL POPULATION RULED FROM A DISTANT CAPITAL OCEANIA HAS
NO CAPITAL AND ITS TITULAR HEAD IS A PERSON WHOSE WHEREABOUTS NOBODY
KNOWS EXCEPT THAT ENGLISH IS ITS CHIEF LINGUA FRANCA AND NEWSPEAK ITS
OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IT IS NOT CENTRALIZED IN ANY WAY ITS RULERS ARE NOT
HELD TOGETHER BY BLOODTIES BUT BY ADHERENCE TO A COMMON DOCTRINE IT IS
TRUE THAT OUR SOCIETY IS STRATIFIED AND VERY RIGIDLY STRATIFIED ON WHAT
AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR TO BE HEREDITARY LINES THERE IS FAR LESS TOANDFRO
MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAN HAPPENED UNDER CAPITALISM OR
EVEN IN THE PREINDUSTRIAL AGE BETWEEN THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE PARTY
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INTERCHANGE BUT ONLY SO MUCH AS WILL ENSURE
THAT WEAKLINGS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE INNER PARTY AND THAT AMBITIOUS
MEMBERS OF THE OUTER PARTY ARE MADE HARMLESS BY ALLOWING THEM TO RISE
PROLETARIANS IN PRACTICE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GRADUATE INTO THE PARTY THE
MOST GIFTED AMONG THEM WHO MIGHT POSSIBLY BECOME NUCLEI OF DISCONTENT
ARE SIMPLY MARKED DOWN BY THE THOUGHT POLICE AND ELIMINATED BUT THIS
STATE OF AFFAIRS IS NOT NECESSARILY PERMANENT NOR IS IT A MATTER OF
PRINCIPLE THE PARTY IS NOT A CLASS IN THE OLD SENSE OF THE WORD IT DOES
NOT AIM AT TRANSMITTING POWER TO ITS OWN CHILDREN AS SUCH AND IF THERE
WERE NO OTHER WAY OF KEEPING THE ABLEST PEOPLE AT THE TOP IT WOULD BE
PERFECTLY PREPARED TO RECRUIT AN ENTIRE NEW GENERATION FROM THE RANKS OF
THE PROLETARIAT IN THE CRUCIAL YEARS THE FACT THAT THE PARTY WAS NOT A
HEREDITARY BODY DID A GREAT DEAL TO NEUTRALIZE OPPOSITION THE OLDER KIND
OF SOCIALIST WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FIGHT AGAINST SOMETHING CALLED
CLASS PRIVILEGE ASSUMED THAT WHAT IS NOT HEREDITARY CANNOT BE PERMANENT
HE DID NOT SEE THAT THE CONTINUITY OF AN OLIGARCHY NEED NOT BE PHYSICAL
NOR DID HE PAUSE TO REFLECT THAT HEREDITARY ARISTOCRACIES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
SHORTLIVED WHEREAS ADOPTIVE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
HAVE SOMETIMES LASTED FOR HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE ESSENCE OF
OLIGARCHICAL RULE IS NOT FATHERTOSON INHERITANCE BUT THE PERSISTENCE OF
A CERTAIN WORLDVIEW AND A CERTAIN WAY OF LIFE IMPOSED BY THE DEAD UPON
THE LIVING A RULING GROUP IS A RULING GROUP SO LONG AS IT CAN NOMINATE
ITS SUCCESSORS THE PARTY IS NOT CONCERNED WITH PERPETUATING ITS BLOOD BUT
WITH PERPETUATING ITSELF WHO WIELDS POWER IS NOT IMPORTANT PROVIDED THAT
THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE REMAINS ALWAYS THE SAME

ALL THE BELIEFS HABITS TASTES EMOTIONS MENTAL ATTITUDES THAT
CHARACTERIZE OUR TIME ARE REALLY DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN THE MYSTIQUE OF
THE PARTY AND PREVENT THE TRUE NATURE OF PRESENTDAY SOCIETY FROM BEING
PERCEIVED PHYSICAL REBELLION OR ANY PRELIMINARY MOVE TOWARDS REBELLION
IS AT PRESENT NOT POSSIBLE FROM THE PROLETARIANS NOTHING IS TO BE FEARED
LEFT TO THEMSELVES THEY WILL CONTINUE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND
FROM CENTURY TO CENTURY WORKING BREEDING AND DYING NOT ONLY WITHOUT
ANY IMPULSE TO REBEL BUT WITHOUT THE POWER OF GRASPING THAT THE WORLD
COULD BE OTHER THAN IT IS THEY COULD ONLY BECOME DANGEROUS IF THE ADVANCE
OF INDUSTRIAL TECHNIQUE MADE IT NECESSARY TO EDUCATE THEM MORE HIGHLY
BUT SINCE MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL RIVALRY ARE NO LONGER IMPORTANT THE
LEVEL OF POPULAR EDUCATION IS ACTUALLY DECLINING WHAT OPINIONS THE MASSES
HOLD OR DO NOT HOLD IS LOOKED ON AS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE THEY CAN
BE GRANTED INTELLECTUAL LIBERTY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO INTELLECT IN A PARTY
MEMBER ON THE OTHER HAND NOT EVEN THE SMALLEST DEVIATION OF OPINION ON
THE MOST UNIMPORTANT SUBJECT CAN BE TOLERATED

A PARTY MEMBER LIVES FROM BIRTH TO DEATH UNDER THE EYE OF THE THOUGHT
POLICE EVEN WHEN HE IS ALONE HE CAN NEVER BE SURE THAT HE IS ALONE
WHEREVER HE MAY BE ASLEEP OR AWAKE WORKING OR RESTING IN HIS BATH OR IN
BED HE CAN BE INSPECTED WITHOUT WARNING AND WITHOUT KNOWING THAT HE IS
BEING INSPECTED NOTHING THAT HE DOES IS INDIFFERENT HIS FRIENDSHIPS HIS
RELAXATIONS HIS BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN THE EXPRESSION
OF HIS FACE WHEN HE IS ALONE THE WORDS HE MUTTERS IN SLEEP EVEN THE
CHARACTERISTIC MOVEMENTS OF HIS BODY ARE ALL JEALOUSLY SCRUTINIZED NOT
ONLY ANY ACTUAL MISDEMEANOUR BUT ANY ECCENTRICITY HOWEVER SMALL ANY
CHANGE OF HABITS ANY NERVOUS MANNERISM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE SYMPTOM
OF AN INNER STRUGGLE IS CERTAIN TO BE DETECTED HE HAS NO FREEDOM OF
CHOICE IN ANY DIRECTION WHATEVER ON THE OTHER HAND HIS ACTIONS ARE NOT
REGULATED BY LAW OR BY ANY CLEARLY FORMULATED CODE OF BEHAVIOUR IN OCEANIA
THERE IS NO LAW THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS WHICH WHEN DETECTED MEAN CERTAIN
DEATH ARE NOT FORMALLY FORBIDDEN AND THE ENDLESS PURGES ARRESTS
TORTURES IMPRISONMENTS AND VAPORIZATIONS ARE NOT INFLICTED AS PUNISHMENT
FOR CRIMES WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN COMMITTED BUT ARE MERELY THE
WIPINGOUT OF PERSONS WHO MIGHT PERHAPS COMMIT A CRIME AT SOME TIME IN THE
FUTURE A PARTY MEMBER IS REQUIRED TO HAVE NOT ONLY THE RIGHT OPINIONS
BUT THE RIGHT INSTINCTS MANY OF THE BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES DEMANDED OF HIM
ARE NEVER PLAINLY STATED AND COULD NOT BE STATED WITHOUT LAYING BARE THE
CONTRADICTIONS INHERENT IN INGSOC IF HE IS A PERSON NATURALLY ORTHODOX
IN NEWSPEAK A GOODTHINKER HE WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES KNOW WITHOUT
TAKING THOUGHT WHAT IS THE TRUE BELIEF OR THE DESIRABLE EMOTION BUT IN
ANY CASE AN ELABORATE MENTAL TRAINING UNDERGONE IN CHILDHOOD AND GROUPING
ITSELF ROUND THE NEWSPEAK WORDS CRIMESTOP BLACKWHITE AND DOUBLETHINK
MAKES HIM UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO THINK TOO DEEPLY ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER

A PARTY MEMBER IS EXPECTED TO HAVE NO PRIVATE EMOTIONS AND NO RESPITES
FROM ENTHUSIASM HE IS SUPPOSED TO LIVE IN A CONTINUOUS FRENZY OF HATRED
OF FOREIGN ENEMIES AND INTERNAL TRAITORS TRIUMPH OVER VICTORIES AND
SELFABASEMENT BEFORE THE POWER AND WISDOM OF THE PARTY THE DISCONTENTS
PRODUCED BY HIS BARE UNSATISFYING LIFE ARE DELIBERATELY TURNED OUTWARDS
AND DISSIPATED BY SUCH DEVICES AS THE TWO MINUTES HATE AND THE
SPECULATIONS WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY INDUCE A SCEPTICAL OR REBELLIOUS ATTITUDE
ARE KILLED IN ADVANCE BY HIS EARLY ACQUIRED INNER DISCIPLINE THE FIRST
AND SIMPLEST STAGE IN THE DISCIPLINE WHICH CAN BE TAUGHT EVEN TO YOUNG
CHILDREN IS CALLED IN NEWSPEAK CRIMESTOP CRIMESTOP MEANS THE FACULTY
OF STOPPING SHORT AS THOUGH BY INSTINCT AT THE THRESHOLD OF ANY DANGEROUS
THOUGHT IT INCLUDES THE POWER OF NOT GRASPING ANALOGIES OF FAILING TO
PERCEIVE LOGICAL ERRORS OF MISUNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ARGUMENTS IF
THEY ARE INIMICAL TO INGSOC AND OF BEING BORED OR REPELLED BY ANY TRAIN
OF THOUGHT WHICH IS CAPABLE OF LEADING IN A HERETICAL DIRECTION CRIMESTOP
IN SHORT MEANS PROTECTIVE STUPIDITY BUT STUPIDITY IS NOT ENOUGH ON THE
CONTRARY ORTHODOXY IN THE FULL SENSE DEMANDS A CONTROL OVER ONES OWN
MENTAL PROCESSES AS COMPLETE AS THAT OF A CONTORTIONIST OVER HIS BODY
OCEANIC SOCIETY RESTS ULTIMATELY ON THE BELIEF THAT BIG BROTHER IS
OMNIPOTENT AND THAT THE PARTY IS INFALLIBLE BUT SINCE IN REALITY BIG
BROTHER IS NOT OMNIPOTENT AND THE PARTY IS NOT INFALLIBLE THERE IS NEED
FOR AN UNWEARYING MOMENTTOMOMENT FLEXIBILITY IN THE TREATMENT OF FACTS
THE KEYWORD HERE IS BLACKWHITE LIKE SO MANY NEWSPEAK WORDS THIS WORD HAS
TWO MUTUALLY CONTRADICTORY MEANINGS APPLIED TO AN OPPONENT IT MEANS THE
HABIT OF IMPUDENTLY CLAIMING THAT BLACK IS WHITE IN CONTRADICTION OF THE
PLAIN FACTS APPLIED TO A PARTY MEMBER IT MEANS A LOYAL WILLINGNESS TO
SAY THAT BLACK IS WHITE WHEN PARTY DISCIPLINE DEMANDS THIS BUT IT MEANS
ALSO THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE THAT BLACK IS WHITE AND MORE TO KNOW THAT
BLACK IS WHITE AND TO FORGET THAT ONE HAS EVER BELIEVED THE CONTRARY
THIS DEMANDS A CONTINUOUS ALTERATION OF THE PAST MADE POSSIBLE BY THE
SYSTEM OF THOUGHT WHICH REALLY EMBRACES ALL THE REST AND WHICH IS KNOWN
IN NEWSPEAK AS DOUBLETHINK

THE ALTERATION OF THE PAST IS NECESSARY FOR TWO REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS
SUBSIDIARY AND SO TO SPEAK PRECAUTIONARY THE SUBSIDIARY REASON IS THAT
THE PARTY MEMBER LIKE THE PROLETARIAN TOLERATES PRESENTDAY CONDITIONS
PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAS NO STANDARDS OF COMPARISON HE MUST BE CUT OFF FROM
THE PAST JUST AS HE MUST BE CUT OFF FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES BECAUSE IT IS
NECESSARY FOR HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS BETTER OFF THAN HIS ANCESTORS AND
THAT THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF MATERIAL COMFORT IS CONSTANTLY RISING BUT BY
FAR THE MORE IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE READJUSTMENT OF THE PAST IS THE
NEED TO SAFEGUARD THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE PARTY IT IS NOT MERELY THAT
SPEECHES STATISTICS AND RECORDS OF EVERY KIND MUST BE CONSTANTLY BROUGHT
UP TO DATE IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT THE PREDICTIONS OF THE PARTY WERE IN
ALL CASES RIGHT IT IS ALSO THAT NO CHANGE IN DOCTRINE OR IN POLITICAL
ALIGNMENT CAN EVER BE ADMITTED FOR TO CHANGE ONES MIND OR EVEN ONES
POLICY IS A CONFESSION OF WEAKNESS IF FOR EXAMPLE EURASIA OR EASTASIA
WHICHEVER IT MAY BE IS THE ENEMY TODAY THEN THAT COUNTRY MUST ALWAYS
HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY AND IF THE FACTS SAY OTHERWISE THEN THE FACTS MUST
BE ALTERED THUS HISTORY IS CONTINUOUSLY REWRITTEN THIS DAYTODAY
FALSIFICATION OF THE PAST CARRIED OUT BY THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH IS AS
NECESSARY TO THE STABILITY OF THE REGIME AS THE WORK OF REPRESSION AND
ESPIONAGE CARRIED OUT BY THE MINISTRY OF LOVE

THE MUTABILITY OF THE PAST IS THE CENTRAL TENET OF INGSOC PAST EVENTS
IT IS ARGUED HAVE NO OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE BUT SURVIVE ONLY IN WRITTEN
RECORDS AND IN HUMAN MEMORIES THE PAST IS WHATEVER THE RECORDS AND THE
MEMORIES AGREE UPON AND SINCE THE PARTY IS IN FULL CONTROL OF ALL RECORDS
AND IN EQUALLY FULL CONTROL OF THE MINDS OF ITS MEMBERS IT FOLLOWS THAT
THE PAST IS WHATEVER THE PARTY CHOOSES TO MAKE IT IT ALSO FOLLOWS THAT
THOUGH THE PAST IS ALTERABLE IT NEVER HAS BEEN ALTERED IN ANY SPECIFIC
INSTANCE FOR WHEN IT HAS BEEN RECREATED IN WHATEVER SHAPE IS NEEDED AT
THE MOMENT THEN THIS NEW VERSION IS THE PAST AND NO DIFFERENT PAST CAN
EVER HAVE EXISTED THIS HOLDS GOOD EVEN WHEN AS OFTEN HAPPENS THE SAME
EVENT HAS TO BE ALTERED OUT OF RECOGNITION SEVERAL TIMES IN THE COURSE OF
A YEAR AT ALL TIMES THE PARTY IS IN POSSESSION OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND
CLEARLY THE ABSOLUTE CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS NOW
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE CONTROL OF THE PAST DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE
TRAINING OF MEMORY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WRITTEN RECORDS AGREE WITH
THE ORTHODOXY OF THE MOMENT IS MERELY A MECHANICAL ACT BUT IT IS ALSO
NECESSARY TO REMEMBER THAT EVENTS HAPPENED IN THE DESIRED MANNER AND IF
IT IS NECESSARY TO REARRANGE ONES MEMORIES OR TO TAMPER WITH WRITTEN
RECORDS THEN IT IS NECESSARY TO FORGET THAT ONE HAS DONE SO THE TRICK OF
DOING THIS CAN BE LEARNED LIKE ANY OTHER MENTAL TECHNIQUE IT IS LEARNED
BY THE MAJORITY OF PARTY MEMBERS AND CERTAINLY BY ALL WHO ARE INTELLIGENT
AS WELL AS ORTHODOX IN OLDSPEAK IT IS CALLED QUITE FRANKLY REALITY
CONTROL IN NEWSPEAK IT IS CALLED DOUBLETHINK THOUGH DOUBLETHINK
COMPRISES MUCH ELSE AS WELL

DOUBLETHINK MEANS THE POWER OF HOLDING TWO CONTRADICTORY BELIEFS IN ONES
MIND SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ACCEPTING BOTH OF THEM THE PARTY INTELLECTUAL
KNOWS IN WHICH DIRECTION HIS MEMORIES MUST BE ALTERED HE THEREFORE KNOWS
THAT HE IS PLAYING TRICKS WITH REALITY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF DOUBLETHINK
HE ALSO SATISFIES HIMSELF THAT REALITY IS NOT VIOLATED THE PROCESS HAS TO
BE CONSCIOUS OR IT WOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT WITH SUFFICIENT PRECISION
BUT IT ALSO HAS TO BE UNCONSCIOUS OR IT WOULD BRING WITH IT A FEELING OF
FALSITY AND HENCE OF GUILT DOUBLETHINK LIES AT THE VERY HEART OF INGSOC
SINCE THE ESSENTIAL ACT OF THE PARTY IS TO USE CONSCIOUS DECEPTION WHILE
RETAINING THE FIRMNESS OF PURPOSE THAT GOES WITH COMPLETE HONESTY TO TELL
DELIBERATE LIES WHILE GENUINELY BELIEVING IN THEM TO FORGET ANY FACT THAT
HAS BECOME INCONVENIENT AND THEN WHEN IT BECOMES NECESSARY AGAIN TO
DRAW IT BACK FROM OBLIVION FOR JUST SO LONG AS IT IS NEEDED TO DENY THE
EXISTENCE OF OBJECTIVE REALITY AND ALL THE WHILE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE
REALITY WHICH ONE DENIESALL THIS IS INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY EVEN IN
USING THE WORD DOUBLETHINK IT IS NECESSARY TO EXERCISE DOUBLETHINK FOR
BY USING THE WORD ONE ADMITS THAT ONE IS TAMPERING WITH REALITY BY A
FRESH ACT OF DOUBLETHINK ONE ERASES THIS KNOWLEDGE AND SO ON INDEFINITELY
WITH THE LIE ALWAYS ONE LEAP AHEAD OF THE TRUTH ULTIMATELY IT IS BY MEANS
OF DOUBLETHINK THAT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ABLEAND MAY FOR ALL WE KNOW
CONTINUE TO BE ABLE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARSTO ARREST THE COURSE OF
HISTORY

ALL PAST OLIGARCHIES HAVE FALLEN FROM POWER EITHER BECAUSE THEY OSSIFIED
OR BECAUSE THEY GREW SOFT EITHER THEY BECAME STUPID AND ARROGANT FAILED
TO ADJUST THEMSELVES TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND WERE OVERTHROWN OR
THEY BECAME LIBERAL AND COWARDLY MADE CONCESSIONS WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE
USED FORCE AND ONCE AGAIN WERE OVERTHROWN THEY FELL THAT IS TO SAY
EITHER THROUGH CONSCIOUSNESS OR THROUGH UNCONSCIOUSNESS IT IS THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PARTY TO HAVE PRODUCED A SYSTEM OF THOUGHT IN WHICH
BOTH CONDITIONS CAN EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY AND UPON NO OTHER INTELLECTUAL
BASIS COULD THE DOMINION OF THE PARTY BE MADE PERMANENT IF ONE IS TO RULE
AND TO CONTINUE RULING ONE MUST BE ABLE TO DISLOCATE THE SENSE OF REALITY
FOR THE SECRET OF RULERSHIP IS TO COMBINE A BELIEF IN ONES OWN
INFALLIBILITY WITH THE POWER TO LEARN FROM PAST MISTAKES

IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT THE SUBTLEST PRACTITIONERS OF DOUBLETHINK ARE
THOSE WHO INVENTED DOUBLETHINK AND KNOW THAT IT IS A VAST SYSTEM OF MENTAL
CHEATING IN OUR SOCIETY THOSE WHO HAVE THE BEST KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING ARE ALSO THOSE WHO ARE FURTHEST FROM SEEING THE WORLD AS IT IS
IN GENERAL THE GREATER THE UNDERSTANDING THE GREATER THE DELUSION THE
MORE INTELLIGENT THE LESS SANE ONE CLEAR ILLUSTRATION OF THIS IS THE
FACT THAT WAR HYSTERIA INCREASES IN INTENSITY AS ONE RISES IN THE SOCIAL
SCALE THOSE WHOSE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE WAR IS MOST NEARLY RATIONAL ARE
THE SUBJECT PEOPLES OF THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES TO THESE PEOPLE THE WAR
IS SIMPLY A CONTINUOUS CALAMITY WHICH SWEEPS TO AND FRO OVER THEIR BODIES
LIKE A TIDAL WAVE WHICH SIDE IS WINNING IS A MATTER OF COMPLETE
INDIFFERENCE TO THEM THEY ARE AWARE THAT A CHANGE OF OVERLORDSHIP MEANS
SIMPLY THAT THEY WILL BE DOING THE SAME WORK AS BEFORE FOR NEW MASTERS WHO
TREAT THEM IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE OLD ONES THE SLIGHTLY MORE FAVOURED
WORKERS WHOM WE CALL THE PROLES ARE ONLY INTERMITTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF THE
WAR WHEN IT IS NECESSARY THEY CAN BE PRODDED INTO FRENZIES OF FEAR AND
HATRED BUT WHEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES THEY ARE CAPABLE OF FORGETTING FOR
LONG PERIODS THAT THE WAR IS HAPPENING IT IS IN THE RANKS OF THE PARTY
AND ABOVE ALL OF THE INNER PARTY THAT THE TRUE WAR ENTHUSIASM IS FOUND
WORLDCONQUEST IS BELIEVED IN MOST FIRMLY BY THOSE WHO KNOW IT TO BE
IMPOSSIBLE THIS PECULIAR LINKINGTOGETHER OF OPPOSITESKNOWLEDGE WITH
IGNORANCE CYNICISM WITH FANATICISMIS ONE OF THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING
MARKS OF OCEANIC SOCIETY THE OFFICIAL IDEOLOGY ABOUNDS WITH CONTRADICTIONS
EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO PRACTICAL REASON FOR THEM THUS THE PARTY REJECTS
AND VILIFIES EVERY PRINCIPLE FOR WHICH THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT ORIGINALLY
STOOD AND IT CHOOSES TO DO THIS IN THE NAME OF SOCIALISM IT PREACHES
A CONTEMPT FOR THE WORKING CLASS UNEXAMPLED FOR CENTURIES PAST AND IT
DRESSES ITS MEMBERS IN A UNIFORM WHICH WAS AT ONE TIME PECULIAR TO MANUAL
WORKERS AND WAS ADOPTED FOR THAT REASON IT SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINES THE
SOLIDARITY OF THE FAMILY AND IT CALLS ITS LEADER BY A NAME WHICH IS A
DIRECT APPEAL TO THE SENTIMENT OF FAMILY LOYALTY EVEN THE NAMES OF THE
FOUR MINISTRIES BY WHICH WE ARE GOVERNED EXHIBIT A SORT OF IMPUDENCE IN
THEIR DELIBERATE REVERSAL OF THE FACTS THE MINISTRY OF PEACE CONCERNS
ITSELF WITH WAR THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH WITH LIES THE MINISTRY OF LOVE
WITH TORTURE AND THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY WITH STARVATION THESE
CONTRADICTIONS ARE NOT ACCIDENTAL NOR DO THEY RESULT FROM ORDINARY
HYPOCRISY THEY ARE DELIBERATE EXERCISES IN DOUBLETHINK FOR IT IS ONLY
BY RECONCILING CONTRADICTIONS THAT POWER CAN BE RETAINED INDEFINITELY
IN NO OTHER WAY COULD THE ANCIENT CYCLE BE BROKEN IF HUMAN EQUALITY IS
TO BE FOR EVER AVERTEDIF THE HIGH AS WE HAVE CALLED THEM ARE TO KEEP
THEIR PLACES PERMANENTLYTHEN THE PREVAILING MENTAL CONDITION MUST BE
CONTROLLED INSANITY

BUT THERE IS ONE QUESTION WHICH UNTIL THIS MOMENT WE HAVE ALMOST IGNORED
IT IS WHY SHOULD HUMAN EQUALITY BE AVERTED SUPPOSING THAT THE MECHANICS
OF THE PROCESS HAVE BEEN RIGHTLY DESCRIBED WHAT IS THE MOTIVE FOR THIS
HUGE ACCURATELY PLANNED EFFORT TO FREEZE HISTORY AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT
OF TIME

HERE WE REACH THE CENTRAL SECRET AS WE HAVE SEEN THE MYSTIQUE OF THE
PARTY AND ABOVE ALL OF THE INNER PARTY DEPENDS UPON DOUBLETHINK BUT
DEEPER THAN THIS LIES THE ORIGINAL MOTIVE THE NEVERQUESTIONED INSTINCT
THAT FIRST LED TO THE SEIZURE OF POWER AND BROUGHT DOUBLETHINK THE
THOUGHT POLICE CONTINUOUS WARFARE AND ALL THE OTHER NECESSARY
PARAPHERNALIA INTO EXISTENCE AFTERWARDS THIS MOTIVE REALLY CONSISTS


WINSTON BECAME AWARE OF SILENCE AS ONE BECOMES AWARE OF A NEW SOUND IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT JULIA HAD BEEN VERY STILL FOR SOME TIME PAST SHE WAS
LYING ON HER SIDE NAKED FROM THE WAIST UPWARDS WITH HER CHEEK PILLOWED
ON HER HAND AND ONE DARK LOCK TUMBLING ACROSS HER EYES HER BREAST ROSE
AND FELL SLOWLY AND REGULARLY

JULIA

NO ANSWER

JULIA ARE YOU AWAKE

NO ANSWER SHE WAS ASLEEP HE SHUT THE BOOK PUT IT CAREFULLY ON THE FLOOR
LAY DOWN AND PULLED THE COVERLET OVER BOTH OF THEM

HE HAD STILL HE REFLECTED NOT LEARNED THE ULTIMATE SECRET HE UNDERSTOOD
HOW HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY CHAPTER I LIKE CHAPTER III HAD NOT
ACTUALLY TOLD HIM ANYTHING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT HAD MERELY SYSTEMATIZED
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE POSSESSED ALREADY BUT AFTER READING IT HE KNEW
BETTER THAN BEFORE THAT HE WAS NOT MAD BEING IN A MINORITY EVEN A
MINORITY OF ONE DID NOT MAKE YOU MAD THERE WAS TRUTH AND THERE WAS
UNTRUTH AND IF YOU CLUNG TO THE TRUTH EVEN AGAINST THE WHOLE WORLD YOU
WERE NOT MAD A YELLOW BEAM FROM THE SINKING SUN SLANTED IN THROUGH THE
WINDOW AND FELL ACROSS THE PILLOW HE SHUT HIS EYES THE SUN ON HIS FACE
AND THE GIRLS SMOOTH BODY TOUCHING HIS OWN GAVE HIM A STRONG SLEEPY
CONFIDENT FEELING HE WAS SAFE EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT HE FELL ASLEEP
MURMURING SANITY IS NOT STATISTICAL WITH THE FEELING THAT THIS REMARK
CONTAINED IN IT A PROFOUND WISDOM



WHEN HE WOKE IT WAS WITH THE SENSATION OF HAVING SLEPT FOR A LONG TIME
BUT A GLANCE AT THE OLDFASHIONED CLOCK TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS ONLY
TWENTYTHIRTY HE LAY DOZING FOR A WHILE THEN THE USUAL DEEPLUNGED
SINGING STRUCK UP FROM THE YARD BELOW


IT WAS ONLY AN OPELESS FANCY
IT PASSED LIKE AN IPRIL DYE
BUT A LOOK AN A WORD AN THE DREAMS THEY STIRRED
THEY AVE STOLEN MY EART AWYE


THE DRIVELLING SONG SEEMED TO HAVE KEPT ITS POPULARITY YOU STILL HEARD IT
ALL OVER THE PLACE IT HAD OUTLIVED THE HATE SONG JULIA WOKE AT THE
SOUND STRETCHED HERSELF LUXURIOUSLY AND GOT OUT OF BED

IM HUNGRY SHE SAID LETS MAKE SOME MORE COFFEE DAMN THE STOVES
GONE OUT AND THE WATERS COLD SHE PICKED THE STOVE UP AND SHOOK IT
THERES NO OIL IN IT

WE CAN GET SOME FROM OLD CHARRINGTON I EXPECT

THE FUNNY THING IS I MADE SURE IT WAS FULL IM GOING TO PUT MY CLOTHES
ON SHE ADDED IT SEEMS TO HAVE GOT COLDER

WINSTON ALSO GOT UP AND DRESSED HIMSELF THE INDEFATIGABLE VOICE SANG ON


THEY SYE THAT TIME EALS ALL THINGS
THEY SYE YOU CAN ALWAYS FORGET
BUT THE SMILES AN THE TEARS ACRORSS THE YEARS
THEY TWIST MY EARTSTRINGS YET


AS HE FASTENED THE BELT OF HIS OVERALLS HE STROLLED ACROSS TO THE WINDOW
THE SUN MUST HAVE GONE DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSES IT WAS NOT SHINING INTO THE
YARD ANY LONGER THE FLAGSTONES WERE WET AS THOUGH THEY HAD JUST BEEN
WASHED AND HE HAD THE FEELING THAT THE SKY HAD BEEN WASHED TOO SO FRESH
AND PALE WAS THE BLUE BETWEEN THE CHIMNEYPOTS TIRELESSLY THE WOMAN
MARCHED TO AND FRO CORKING AND UNCORKING HERSELF SINGING AND FALLING
SILENT AND PEGGING OUT MORE DIAPERS AND MORE AND YET MORE HE WONDERED
WHETHER SHE TOOK IN WASHING FOR A LIVING OR WAS MERELY THE SLAVE OF TWENTY
OR THIRTY GRANDCHILDREN JULIA HAD COME ACROSS TO HIS SIDE TOGETHER THEY
GAZED DOWN WITH A SORT OF FASCINATION AT THE STURDY FIGURE BELOW AS HE
LOOKED AT THE WOMAN IN HER CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE HER THICK ARMS REACHING
UP FOR THE LINE HER POWERFUL MARELIKE BUTTOCKS PROTRUDED IT STRUCK HIM
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL IT HAD NEVER BEFORE OCCURRED TO
HIM THAT THE BODY OF A WOMAN OF FIFTY BLOWN UP TO MONSTROUS DIMENSIONS BY
CHILDBEARING THEN HARDENED ROUGHENED BY WORK TILL IT WAS COARSE IN THE
GRAIN LIKE AN OVERRIPE TURNIP COULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS SO AND
AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT WHY NOT THE SOLID CONTOURLESS BODY LIKE A BLOCK
OF GRANITE AND THE RASPING RED SKIN BORE THE SAME RELATION TO THE BODY
OF A GIRL AS THE ROSEHIP TO THE ROSE WHY SHOULD THE FRUIT BE HELD
INFERIOR TO THE FLOWER

SHES BEAUTIFUL HE MURMURED

SHES A METRE ACROSS THE HIPS EASILY SAID JULIA

THAT IS HER STYLE OF BEAUTY SAID WINSTON

HE HELD JULIAS SUPPLE WAIST EASILY ENCIRCLED BY HIS ARM FROM THE HIP TO
THE KNEE HER FLANK WAS AGAINST HIS OUT OF THEIR BODIES NO CHILD WOULD
EVER COME THAT WAS THE ONE THING THEY COULD NEVER DO ONLY BY WORD OF
MOUTH FROM MIND TO MIND COULD THEY PASS ON THE SECRET THE WOMAN DOWN
THERE HAD NO MIND SHE HAD ONLY STRONG ARMS A WARM HEART AND A FERTILE
BELLY HE WONDERED HOW MANY CHILDREN SHE HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO IT MIGHT
EASILY BE FIFTEEN SHE HAD HAD HER MOMENTARY FLOWERING A YEAR PERHAPS
OF WILDROSE BEAUTY AND THEN SHE HAD SUDDENLY SWOLLEN LIKE A FERTILIZED
FRUIT AND GROWN HARD AND RED AND COARSE AND THEN HER LIFE HAD BEEN
LAUNDERING SCRUBBING DARNING COOKING SWEEPING POLISHING MENDING
SCRUBBING LAUNDERING FIRST FOR CHILDREN THEN FOR GRANDCHILDREN OVER
THIRTY UNBROKEN YEARS AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS STILL SINGING THE MYSTICAL
REVERENCE THAT HE FELT FOR HER WAS SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH THE ASPECT OF
THE PALE CLOUDLESS SKY STRETCHING AWAY BEHIND THE CHIMNEYPOTS INTO
INTERMINABLE DISTANCE IT WAS CURIOUS TO THINK THAT THE SKY WAS THE SAME
FOR EVERYBODY IN EURASIA OR EASTASIA AS WELL AS HERE AND THE PEOPLE
UNDER THE SKY WERE ALSO VERY MUCH THE SAMEEVERYWHERE ALL OVER THE WORLD
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE THIS PEOPLE IGNORANT
OF ONE ANOTHERS EXISTENCE HELD APART BY WALLS OF HATRED AND LIES AND
YET ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAMEPEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER LEARNED TO THINK BUT WHO
WERE STORING UP IN THEIR HEARTS AND BELLIES AND MUSCLES THE POWER THAT
WOULD ONE DAY OVERTURN THE WORLD IF THERE WAS HOPE IT LAY IN THE PROLES
WITHOUT HAVING READ TO THE END OF THE BOOK HE KNEW THAT THAT MUST BE
GOLDSTEINS FINAL MESSAGE THE FUTURE BELONGED TO THE PROLES AND COULD HE
BE SURE THAT WHEN THEIR TIME CAME THE WORLD THEY CONSTRUCTED WOULD NOT BE
JUST AS ALIEN TO HIM WINSTON SMITH AS THE WORLD OF THE PARTY YES
BECAUSE AT THE LEAST IT WOULD BE A WORLD OF SANITY WHERE THERE IS
EQUALITY THERE CAN BE SANITY SOONER OR LATER IT WOULD HAPPEN STRENGTH
WOULD CHANGE INTO CONSCIOUSNESS THE PROLES WERE IMMORTAL YOU COULD NOT
DOUBT IT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THAT VALIANT FIGURE IN THE YARD IN THE END
THEIR AWAKENING WOULD COME AND UNTIL THAT HAPPENED THOUGH IT MIGHT BE A
THOUSAND YEARS THEY WOULD STAY ALIVE AGAINST ALL THE ODDS LIKE BIRDS
PASSING ON FROM BODY TO BODY THE VITALITY WHICH THE PARTY DID NOT SHARE
AND COULD NOT KILL

DO YOU REMEMBER HE SAID THE THRUSH THAT SANG TO US THAT FIRST DAY
AT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD

HE WASNT SINGING TO US SAID JULIA HE WAS SINGING TO PLEASE HIMSELF
NOT EVEN THAT HE WAS JUST SINGING

THE BIRDS SANG THE PROLES SANG THE PARTY DID NOT SING ALL ROUND THE
WORLD IN LONDON AND NEW YORK IN AFRICA AND BRAZIL AND IN THE MYSTERIOUS
FORBIDDEN LANDS BEYOND THE FRONTIERS IN THE STREETS OF PARIS AND BERLIN
IN THE VILLAGES OF THE ENDLESS RUSSIAN PLAIN IN THE BAZAARS OF CHINA AND
JAPANEVERYWHERE STOOD THE SAME SOLID UNCONQUERABLE FIGURE MADE MONSTROUS
BY WORK AND CHILDBEARING TOILING FROM BIRTH TO DEATH AND STILL SINGING
OUT OF THOSE MIGHTY LOINS A RACE OF CONSCIOUS BEINGS MUST ONE DAY COME
YOU WERE THE DEAD THEIRS WAS THE FUTURE BUT YOU COULD SHARE IN THAT
FUTURE IF YOU KEPT ALIVE THE MIND AS THEY KEPT ALIVE THE BODY AND PASSED
ON THE SECRET DOCTRINE THAT TWO PLUS TWO MAKE FOUR

WE ARE THE DEAD HE SAID

WE ARE THE DEAD ECHOED JULIA DUTIFULLY

YOU ARE THE DEAD SAID AN IRON VOICE BEHIND THEM

THEY SPRANG APART WINSTONS ENTRAILS SEEMED TO HAVE TURNED INTO ICE HE
COULD SEE THE WHITE ALL ROUND THE IRISES OF JULIAS EYES HER FACE HAD
TURNED A MILKY YELLOW THE SMEAR OF ROUGE THAT WAS STILL ON EACH CHEEKBONE
STOOD OUT SHARPLY ALMOST AS THOUGH UNCONNECTED WITH THE SKIN BENEATH

YOU ARE THE DEAD REPEATED THE IRON VOICE

IT WAS BEHIND THE PICTURE BREATHED JULIA

IT WAS BEHIND THE PICTURE SAID THE VOICE REMAIN EXACTLY WHERE YOU
ARE MAKE NO MOVEMENT UNTIL YOU ARE ORDERED

IT WAS STARTING IT WAS STARTING AT LAST THEY COULD DO NOTHING EXCEPT
STAND GAZING INTO ONE ANOTHERS EYES TO RUN FOR LIFE TO GET OUT OF THE
HOUSE BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATENO SUCH THOUGHT OCCURRED TO THEM UNTHINKABLE
TO DISOBEY THE IRON VOICE FROM THE WALL THERE WAS A SNAP AS THOUGH A CATCH
HAD BEEN TURNED BACK AND A CRASH OF BREAKING GLASS THE PICTURE HAD FALLEN
TO THE FLOOR UNCOVERING THE TELESCREEN BEHIND IT

NOW THEY CAN SEE US SAID JULIA

NOW WE CAN SEE YOU SAID THE VOICE STAND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROOM STAND BACK TO BACK CLASP YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEADS DO NOT TOUCH
ONE ANOTHER

THEY WERE NOT TOUCHING BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE COULD FEEL JULIAS
BODY SHAKING OR PERHAPS IT WAS MERELY THE SHAKING OF HIS OWN HE COULD
JUST STOP HIS TEETH FROM CHATTERING BUT HIS KNEES WERE BEYOND HIS CONTROL
THERE WAS A SOUND OF TRAMPLING BOOTS BELOW INSIDE THE HOUSE AND OUTSIDE
THE YARD SEEMED TO BE FULL OF MEN SOMETHING WAS BEING DRAGGED ACROSS THE
STONES THE WOMANS SINGING HAD STOPPED ABRUPTLY THERE WAS A LONG ROLLING
CLANG AS THOUGH THE WASHTUB HAD BEEN FLUNG ACROSS THE YARD AND THEN A
CONFUSION OF ANGRY SHOUTS WHICH ENDED IN A YELL OF PAIN

THE HOUSE IS SURROUNDED SAID WINSTON

THE HOUSE IS SURROUNDED SAID THE VOICE

HE HEARD JULIA SNAP HER TEETH TOGETHER I SUPPOSE WE MAY AS WELL SAY
GOODBYE SHE SAID

YOU MAY AS WELL SAY GOODBYE SAID THE VOICE AND THEN ANOTHER QUITE
DIFFERENT VOICE A THIN CULTIVATED VOICE WHICH WINSTON HAD THE IMPRESSION
OF HAVING HEARD BEFORE STRUCK IN AND BY THE WAY WHILE WE ARE ON THE
SUBJECT HERE COMES A CANDLE TO LIGHT YOU TO BED HERE COMES A CHOPPER TO
CHOP OFF YOUR HEAD

SOMETHING CRASHED ON TO THE BED BEHIND WINSTONS BACK THE HEAD OF A LADDER
HAD BEEN THRUST THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HAD BURST IN THE FRAME SOMEONE WAS
CLIMBING THROUGH THE WINDOW THERE WAS A STAMPEDE OF BOOTS UP THE STAIRS
THE ROOM WAS FULL OF SOLID MEN IN BLACK UNIFORMS WITH IRONSHOD BOOTS ON
THEIR FEET AND TRUNCHEONS IN THEIR HANDS

WINSTON WAS NOT TREMBLING ANY LONGER EVEN HIS EYES HE BARELY MOVED ONE
THING ALONE MATTERED TO KEEP STILL TO KEEP STILL AND NOT GIVE THEM AN
EXCUSE TO HIT YOU A MAN WITH A SMOOTH PRIZEFIGHTERS JOWL IN WHICH THE
MOUTH WAS ONLY A SLIT PAUSED OPPOSITE HIM BALANCING HIS TRUNCHEON
MEDITATIVELY BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER WINSTON MET HIS EYES THE
FEELING OF NAKEDNESS WITH ONES HANDS BEHIND ONES HEAD AND ONES FACE
AND BODY ALL EXPOSED WAS ALMOST UNBEARABLE THE MAN PROTRUDED THE TIP
OF A WHITE TONGUE LICKED THE PLACE WHERE HIS LIPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND
THEN PASSED ON THERE WAS ANOTHER CRASH SOMEONE HAD PICKED UP THE GLASS
PAPERWEIGHT FROM THE TABLE AND SMASHED IT TO PIECES ON THE HEARTHSTONE

THE FRAGMENT OF CORAL A TINY CRINKLE OF PINK LIKE A SUGAR ROSEBUD FROM
A CAKE ROLLED ACROSS THE MAT HOW SMALL THOUGHT WINSTON HOW SMALL IT
ALWAYS WAS THERE WAS A GASP AND A THUMP BEHIND HIM AND HE RECEIVED A
VIOLENT KICK ON THE ANKLE WHICH NEARLY FLUNG HIM OFF HIS BALANCE ONE OF
THE MEN HAD SMASHED HIS FIST INTO JULIAS SOLAR PLEXUS DOUBLING HER UP
LIKE A POCKET RULER SHE WAS THRASHING ABOUT ON THE FLOOR FIGHTING FOR
BREATH WINSTON DARED NOT TURN HIS HEAD EVEN BY A MILLIMETRE BUT SOMETIMES
HER LIVID GASPING FACE CAME WITHIN THE ANGLE OF HIS VISION EVEN IN HIS
TERROR IT WAS AS THOUGH HE COULD FEEL THE PAIN IN HIS OWN BODY THE DEADLY
PAIN WHICH NEVERTHELESS WAS LESS URGENT THAN THE STRUGGLE TO GET BACK HER
BREATH HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE THE TERRIBLE AGONIZING PAIN WHICH WAS
THERE ALL THE WHILE BUT COULD NOT BE SUFFERED YET BECAUSE BEFORE ALL ELSE
IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO BREATHE THEN TWO OF THE MEN HOISTED HER
UP BY KNEES AND SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE ROOM LIKE A SACK
WINSTON HAD A GLIMPSE OF HER FACE UPSIDE DOWN YELLOW AND CONTORTED WITH
THE EYES SHUT AND STILL WITH A SMEAR OF ROUGE ON EITHER CHEEK AND THAT
WAS THE LAST HE SAW OF HER

HE STOOD DEAD STILL NO ONE HAD HIT HIM YET THOUGHTS WHICH CAME OF THEIR
OWN ACCORD BUT SEEMED TOTALLY UNINTERESTING BEGAN TO FLIT THROUGH HIS
MIND HE WONDERED WHETHER THEY HAD GOT MR CHARRINGTON HE WONDERED WHAT
THEY HAD DONE TO THE WOMAN IN THE YARD HE NOTICED THAT HE BADLY WANTED
TO URINATE AND FELT A FAINT SURPRISE BECAUSE HE HAD DONE SO ONLY TWO OR
THREE HOURS AGO HE NOTICED THAT THE CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE SAID NINE
MEANING TWENTYONE BUT THE LIGHT SEEMED TOO STRONG WOULD NOT THE LIGHT
BE FADING AT TWENTYONE HOURS ON AN AUGUST EVENING HE WONDERED WHETHER
AFTER ALL HE AND JULIA HAD MISTAKEN THE TIMEHAD SLEPT THE CLOCK ROUND
AND THOUGHT IT WAS TWENTYTHIRTY WHEN REALLY IT WAS NOUGHT EIGHTTHIRTY
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT HE DID NOT PURSUE THE THOUGHT FURTHER
IT WAS NOT INTERESTING

THERE WAS ANOTHER LIGHTER STEP IN THE PASSAGE MR CHARRINGTON CAME INTO
THE ROOM THE DEMEANOUR OF THE BLACKUNIFORMED MEN SUDDENLY BECAME MORE
SUBDUED SOMETHING HAD ALSO CHANGED IN MR CHARRINGTONS APPEARANCE HIS
EYE FELL ON THE FRAGMENTS OF THE GLASS PAPERWEIGHT

PICK UP THOSE PIECES HE SAID SHARPLY

A MAN STOOPED TO OBEY THE COCKNEY ACCENT HAD DISAPPEARED WINSTON SUDDENLY
REALIZED WHOSE VOICE IT WAS THAT HE HAD HEARD A FEW MOMENTS AGO ON THE
TELESCREEN MR CHARRINGTON WAS STILL WEARING HIS OLD VELVET JACKET BUT
HIS HAIR WHICH HAD BEEN ALMOST WHITE HAD TURNED BLACK ALSO HE WAS NOT
WEARING HIS SPECTACLES HE GAVE WINSTON A SINGLE SHARP GLANCE AS THOUGH
VERIFYING HIS IDENTITY AND THEN PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM HE WAS
STILL RECOGNIZABLE BUT HE WAS NOT THE SAME PERSON ANY LONGER HIS BODY
HAD STRAIGHTENED AND SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN BIGGER HIS FACE HAD UNDERGONE
ONLY TINY CHANGES THAT HAD NEVERTHELESS WORKED A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION
THE BLACK EYEBROWS WERE LESS BUSHY THE WRINKLES WERE GONE THE WHOLE
LINES OF THE FACE SEEMED TO HAVE ALTERED EVEN THE NOSE SEEMED SHORTER IT
WAS THE ALERT COLD FACE OF A MAN OF ABOUT FIVEANDTHIRTY IT OCCURRED TO
WINSTON THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS LOOKING WITH KNOWLEDGE
AT A MEMBER OF THE THOUGHT POLICE





PART THREE




CHAPTER 1



HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS PRESUMABLY HE WAS IN THE MINISTRY OF LOVE
BUT THERE WAS NO WAY OF MAKING CERTAIN HE WAS IN A HIGHCEILINGED
WINDOWLESS CELL WITH WALLS OF GLITTERING WHITE PORCELAIN CONCEALED LAMPS
FLOODED IT WITH COLD LIGHT AND THERE WAS A LOW STEADY HUMMING SOUND
WHICH HE SUPPOSED HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AIR SUPPLY A BENCH OR
SHELF JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO SIT ON RAN ROUND THE WALL BROKEN ONLY BY THE
DOOR AND AT THE END OPPOSITE THE DOOR A LAVATORY PAN WITH NO WOODEN
SEAT THERE WERE FOUR TELESCREENS ONE IN EACH WALL

THERE WAS A DULL ACHING IN HIS BELLY IT HAD BEEN THERE EVER SINCE THEY
HAD BUNDLED HIM INTO THE CLOSED VAN AND DRIVEN HIM AWAY BUT HE WAS ALSO
HUNGRY WITH A GNAWING UNWHOLESOME KIND OF HUNGER IT MIGHT BE TWENTYFOUR
HOURS SINCE HE HAD EATEN IT MIGHT BE THIRTYSIX HE STILL DID NOT KNOW
PROBABLY NEVER WOULD KNOW WHETHER IT HAD BEEN MORNING OR EVENING WHEN
THEY ARRESTED HIM SINCE HE WAS ARRESTED HE HAD NOT BEEN FED

HE SAT AS STILL AS HE COULD ON THE NARROW BENCH WITH HIS HANDS CROSSED
ON HIS KNEE HE HAD ALREADY LEARNED TO SIT STILL IF YOU MADE UNEXPECTED
MOVEMENTS THEY YELLED AT YOU FROM THE TELESCREEN BUT THE CRAVING FOR FOOD
WAS GROWING UPON HIM WHAT HE LONGED FOR ABOVE ALL WAS A PIECE OF BREAD
HE HAD AN IDEA THAT THERE WERE A FEW BREADCRUMBS IN THE POCKET OF HIS
OVERALLS IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLEHE THOUGHT THIS BECAUSE FROM TIME TO TIME
SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICKLE HIS LEGTHAT THERE MIGHT BE A SIZEABLE BIT OF
CRUST THERE IN THE END THE TEMPTATION TO FIND OUT OVERCAME HIS FEAR HE
SLIPPED A HAND INTO HIS POCKET

SMITH YELLED A VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN 6079 SMITH W HANDS OUT OF
POCKETS IN THE CELLS

HE SAT STILL AGAIN HIS HANDS CROSSED ON HIS KNEE BEFORE BEING BROUGHT
HERE HE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO ANOTHER PLACE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN AN ORDINARY
PRISON OR A TEMPORARY LOCKUP USED BY THE PATROLS HE DID NOT KNOW HOW
LONG HE HAD BEEN THERE SOME HOURS AT ANY RATE WITH NO CLOCKS AND NO
DAYLIGHT IT WAS HARD TO GAUGE THE TIME IT WAS A NOISY EVILSMELLING
PLACE THEY HAD PUT HIM INTO A CELL SIMILAR TO THE ONE HE WAS NOW IN
BUT FILTHILY DIRTY AND AT ALL TIMES CROWDED BY TEN OR FIFTEEN PEOPLE THE
MAJORITY OF THEM WERE COMMON CRIMINALS BUT THERE WERE A FEW POLITICAL
PRISONERS AMONG THEM HE HAD SAT SILENT AGAINST THE WALL JOSTLED BY DIRTY
BODIES TOO PREOCCUPIED BY FEAR AND THE PAIN IN HIS BELLY TO TAKE MUCH
INTEREST IN HIS SURROUNDINGS BUT STILL NOTICING THE ASTONISHING DIFFERENCE
IN DEMEANOUR BETWEEN THE PARTY PRISONERS AND THE OTHERS THE PARTY
PRISONERS WERE ALWAYS SILENT AND TERRIFIED BUT THE ORDINARY CRIMINALS
SEEMED TO CARE NOTHING FOR ANYBODY THEY YELLED INSULTS AT THE GUARDS
FOUGHT BACK FIERCELY WHEN THEIR BELONGINGS WERE IMPOUNDED WROTE OBSCENE
WORDS ON THE FLOOR ATE SMUGGLED FOOD WHICH THEY PRODUCED FROM MYSTERIOUS
HIDINGPLACES IN THEIR CLOTHES AND EVEN SHOUTED DOWN THE TELESCREEN WHEN
IT TRIED TO RESTORE ORDER ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF THEM SEEMED TO BE ON
GOOD TERMS WITH THE GUARDS CALLED THEM BY NICKNAMES AND TRIED TO WHEEDLE
CIGARETTES THROUGH THE SPYHOLE IN THE DOOR THE GUARDS TOO TREATED THE
COMMON CRIMINALS WITH A CERTAIN FORBEARANCE EVEN WHEN THEY HAD TO HANDLE
THEM ROUGHLY THERE WAS MUCH TALK ABOUT THE FORCEDLABOUR CAMPS TO WHICH
MOST OF THE PRISONERS EXPECTED TO BE SENT IT WAS ALL RIGHT IN THE
CAMPS HE GATHERED SO LONG AS YOU HAD GOOD CONTACTS AND KNEW THE ROPES
THERE WAS BRIBERY FAVOURITISM AND RACKETEERING OF EVERY KIND THERE WAS
HOMOSEXUALITY AND PROSTITUTION THERE WAS EVEN ILLICIT ALCOHOL DISTILLED
FROM POTATOES THE POSITIONS OF TRUST WERE GIVEN ONLY TO THE COMMON
CRIMINALS ESPECIALLY THE GANGSTERS AND THE MURDERERS WHO FORMED A SORT
OF ARISTOCRACY ALL THE DIRTY JOBS WERE DONE BY THE POLITICALS

THERE WAS A CONSTANT COMEANDGO OF PRISONERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
DRUGPEDDLERS THIEVES BANDITS BLACKMARKETEERS DRUNKS PROSTITUTES
SOME OF THE DRUNKS WERE SO VIOLENT THAT THE OTHER PRISONERS HAD TO COMBINE
TO SUPPRESS THEM AN ENORMOUS WRECK OF A WOMAN AGED ABOUT SIXTY WITH
GREAT TUMBLING BREASTS AND THICK COILS OF WHITE HAIR WHICH HAD COME DOWN
IN HER STRUGGLES WAS CARRIED IN KICKING AND SHOUTING BY FOUR GUARDS
WHO HAD HOLD OF HER ONE AT EACH CORNER THEY WRENCHED OFF THE BOOTS WITH
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO KICK THEM AND DUMPED HER DOWN ACROSS
WINSTONS LAP ALMOST BREAKING HIS THIGHBONES THE WOMAN HOISTED HERSELF
UPRIGHT AND FOLLOWED THEM OUT WITH A YELL OF F BASTARDS THEN
NOTICING THAT SHE WAS SITTING ON SOMETHING UNEVEN SHE SLID OFF WINSTONS
KNEES ON TO THE BENCH

BEG PARDON DEARIE SHE SAID I WOULDNT A SAT ON YOU ONLY THE BUGGERS
PUT ME THERE THEY DONO OW TO TREAT A LADY DO THEY SHE PAUSED PATTED
HER BREAST AND BELCHED PARDON SHE SAID I AINT MESELF QUITE

SHE LEANT FORWARD AND VOMITED COPIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR

THASS BETTER SHE SAID LEANING BACK WITH CLOSED EYES NEVER KEEP IT
DOWN THASS WHAT I SAY GET IT UP WHILE ITS FRESH ON YOUR STOMACH LIKE

SHE REVIVED TURNED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT WINSTON AND SEEMED IMMEDIATELY
TO TAKE A FANCY TO HIM SHE PUT A VAST ARM ROUND HIS SHOULDER AND DREW HIM
TOWARDS HER BREATHING BEER AND VOMIT INTO HIS FACE

WASS YOUR NAME DEARIE SHE SAID

SMITH SAID WINSTON

SMITH SAID THE WOMAN THASS FUNNY MY NAMES SMITH TOO WHY SHE
ADDED SENTIMENTALLY I MIGHT BE YOUR MOTHER

SHE MIGHT THOUGHT WINSTON BE HIS MOTHER SHE WAS ABOUT THE RIGHT AGE AND
PHYSIQUE AND IT WAS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE CHANGED SOMEWHAT AFTER TWENTY
YEARS IN A FORCEDLABOUR CAMP

NO ONE ELSE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM TO A SURPRISING EXTENT THE ORDINARY
CRIMINALS IGNORED THE PARTY PRISONERS THE POLITS THEY CALLED THEM
WITH A SORT OF UNINTERESTED CONTEMPT THE PARTY PRISONERS SEEMED TERRIFIED
OF SPEAKING TO ANYBODY AND ABOVE ALL OF SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER ONLY
ONCE WHEN TWO PARTY MEMBERS BOTH WOMEN WERE PRESSED CLOSE TOGETHER ON
THE BENCH HE OVERHEARD AMID THE DIN OF VOICES A FEW HURRIEDLYWHISPERED
WORDS AND IN PARTICULAR A REFERENCE TO SOMETHING CALLED ROOM ONEOHONE
WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND

IT MIGHT BE TWO OR THREE HOURS AGO THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM HERE THE
DULL PAIN IN HIS BELLY NEVER WENT AWAY BUT SOMETIMES IT GREW BETTER AND
SOMETIMES WORSE AND HIS THOUGHTS EXPANDED OR CONTRACTED ACCORDINGLY WHEN
IT GREW WORSE HE THOUGHT ONLY OF THE PAIN ITSELF AND OF HIS DESIRE FOR
FOOD WHEN IT GREW BETTER PANIC TOOK HOLD OF HIM THERE WERE MOMENTS
WHEN HE FORESAW THE THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM WITH SUCH ACTUALITY
THAT HIS HEART GALLOPED AND HIS BREATH STOPPED HE FELT THE SMASH OF
TRUNCHEONS ON HIS ELBOWS AND IRONSHOD BOOTS ON HIS SHINS HE SAW HIMSELF
GROVELLING ON THE FLOOR SCREAMING FOR MERCY THROUGH BROKEN TEETH HE
HARDLY THOUGHT OF JULIA HE COULD NOT FIX HIS MIND ON HER HE LOVED HER
AND WOULD NOT BETRAY HER BUT THAT WAS ONLY A FACT KNOWN AS HE KNEW THE
RULES OF ARITHMETIC HE FELT NO LOVE FOR HER AND HE HARDLY EVEN WONDERED
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER HE THOUGHT OFTENER OF OBRIEN WITH A FLICKERING
HOPE OBRIEN MIGHT KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED THE BROTHERHOOD HE
HAD SAID NEVER TRIED TO SAVE ITS MEMBERS BUT THERE WAS THE RAZOR BLADE
THEY WOULD SEND THE RAZOR BLADE IF THEY COULD THERE WOULD BE PERHAPS FIVE
SECONDS BEFORE THE GUARD COULD RUSH INTO THE CELL THE BLADE WOULD BITE
INTO HIM WITH A SORT OF BURNING COLDNESS AND EVEN THE FINGERS THAT HELD
IT WOULD BE CUT TO THE BONE EVERYTHING CAME BACK TO HIS SICK BODY WHICH
SHRANK TREMBLING FROM THE SMALLEST PAIN HE WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD
USE THE RAZOR BLADE EVEN IF HE GOT THE CHANCE IT WAS MORE NATURAL TO EXIST
FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT ACCEPTING ANOTHER TEN MINUTES LIFE EVEN WITH THE
CERTAINTY THAT THERE WAS TORTURE AT THE END OF IT

SOMETIMES HE TRIED TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF PORCELAIN BRICKS IN THE
WALLS OF THE CELL IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASY BUT HE ALWAYS LOST COUNT AT
SOME POINT OR ANOTHER MORE OFTEN HE WONDERED WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT TIME
OF DAY IT WAS AT ONE MOMENT HE FELT CERTAIN THAT IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT
OUTSIDE AND AT THE NEXT EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT IT WAS PITCH DARKNESS IN
THIS PLACE HE KNEW INSTINCTIVELY THE LIGHTS WOULD NEVER BE TURNED OUT
IT WAS THE PLACE WITH NO DARKNESS HE SAW NOW WHY OBRIEN HAD SEEMED TO
RECOGNIZE THE ALLUSION IN THE MINISTRY OF LOVE THERE WERE NO WINDOWS HIS
CELL MIGHT BE AT THE HEART OF THE BUILDING OR AGAINST ITS OUTER WALL IT
MIGHT BE TEN FLOORS BELOW GROUND OR THIRTY ABOVE IT HE MOVED HIMSELF
MENTALLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND TRIED TO DETERMINE BY THE FEELING OF HIS
BODY WHETHER HE WAS PERCHED HIGH IN THE AIR OR BURIED DEEP UNDERGROUND

THERE WAS A SOUND OF MARCHING BOOTS OUTSIDE THE STEEL DOOR OPENED WITH
A CLANG A YOUNG OFFICER A TRIM BLACKUNIFORMED FIGURE WHO SEEMED TO
GLITTER ALL OVER WITH POLISHED LEATHER AND WHOSE PALE STRAIGHTFEATURED
FACE WAS LIKE A WAX MASK STEPPED SMARTLY THROUGH THE DOORWAY HE MOTIONED
TO THE GUARDS OUTSIDE TO BRING IN THE PRISONER THEY WERE LEADING THE
POET AMPLEFORTH SHAMBLED INTO THE CELL THE DOOR CLANGED SHUT AGAIN

AMPLEFORTH MADE ONE OR TWO UNCERTAIN MOVEMENTS FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS
THOUGH HAVING SOME IDEA THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER DOOR TO GO OUT OF AND THEN
BEGAN TO WANDER UP AND DOWN THE CELL HE HAD NOT YET NOTICED WINSTONS
PRESENCE HIS TROUBLED EYES WERE GAZING AT THE WALL ABOUT A METRE ABOVE
THE LEVEL OF WINSTONS HEAD HE WAS SHOELESS LARGE DIRTY TOES WERE
STICKING OUT OF THE HOLES IN HIS SOCKS HE WAS ALSO SEVERAL DAYS AWAY
FROM A SHAVE A SCRUBBY BEARD COVERED HIS FACE TO THE CHEEKBONES GIVING
HIM AN AIR OF RUFFIANISM THAT WENT ODDLY WITH HIS LARGE WEAK FRAME AND
NERVOUS MOVEMENTS

WINSTON ROUSED HIMSELF A LITTLE FROM HIS LETHARGY HE MUST SPEAK
TO AMPLEFORTH AND RISK THE YELL FROM THE TELESCREEN IT WAS EVEN
CONCEIVABLE THAT AMPLEFORTH WAS THE BEARER OF THE RAZOR BLADE

AMPLEFORTH HE SAID

THERE WAS NO YELL FROM THE TELESCREEN AMPLEFORTH PAUSED MILDLY STARTLED
HIS EYES FOCUSED THEMSELVES SLOWLY ON WINSTON

AH SMITH HE SAID YOU TOO

WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR

TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH HE SAT DOWN AWKWARDLY ON THE BENCH OPPOSITE
WINSTON THERE IS ONLY ONE OFFENCE IS THERE NOT HE SAID

AND HAVE YOU COMMITTED IT

APPARENTLY I HAVE

HE PUT A HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD AND PRESSED HIS TEMPLES FOR A MOMENT AS
THOUGH TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING

THESE THINGS HAPPEN HE BEGAN VAGUELY I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECALL ONE
INSTANCEA POSSIBLE INSTANCE IT WAS AN INDISCRETION UNDOUBTEDLY WE
WERE PRODUCING A DEFINITIVE EDITION OF THE POEMS OF KIPLING I ALLOWED THE
WORD GOD TO REMAIN AT THE END OF A LINE I COULD NOT HELP IT HE ADDED
ALMOST INDIGNANTLY RAISING HIS FACE TO LOOK AT WINSTON IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO CHANGE THE LINE THE RHYME WAS ROD DO YOU REALIZE THAT THERE ARE ONLY
TWELVE RHYMES TO ROD IN THE ENTIRE LANGUAGE FOR DAYS I HAD RACKED MY
BRAINS THERE WAS NO OTHER RHYME

THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE CHANGED THE ANNOYANCE PASSED OUT OF IT AND FOR
A MOMENT HE LOOKED ALMOST PLEASED A SORT OF INTELLECTUAL WARMTH THE JOY
OF THE PEDANT WHO HAS FOUND OUT SOME USELESS FACT SHONE THROUGH THE DIRT
AND SCRUBBY HAIR

HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU HE SAID THAT THE WHOLE HISTORY OF ENGLISH
POETRY HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LACKS
RHYMES

NO THAT PARTICULAR THOUGHT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO WINSTON NOR IN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES DID IT STRIKE HIM AS VERY IMPORTANT OR INTERESTING

DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS HE SAID

AMPLEFORTH LOOKED STARTLED AGAIN I HAD HARDLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT THEY
ARRESTED MEIT COULD BE TWO DAYS AGOPERHAPS THREE HIS EYES FLITTED
ROUND THE WALLS AS THOUGH HE HALF EXPECTED TO FIND A WINDOW SOMEWHERE
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NIGHT AND DAY IN THIS PLACE I DO NOT SEE
HOW ONE CAN CALCULATE THE TIME

THEY TALKED DESULTORILY FOR SOME MINUTES THEN WITHOUT APPARENT REASON
A YELL FROM THE TELESCREEN BADE THEM BE SILENT WINSTON SAT QUIETLY HIS
HANDS CROSSED AMPLEFORTH TOO LARGE TO SIT IN COMFORT ON THE NARROW
BENCH FIDGETED FROM SIDE TO SIDE CLASPING HIS LANK HANDS FIRST ROUND ONE
KNEE THEN ROUND THE OTHER THE TELESCREEN BARKED AT HIM TO KEEP STILL
TIME PASSED TWENTY MINUTES AN HOURIT WAS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE ONCE MORE
THERE WAS A SOUND OF BOOTS OUTSIDE WINSTONS ENTRAILS CONTRACTED SOON
VERY SOON PERHAPS IN FIVE MINUTES PERHAPS NOW THE TRAMP OF BOOTS WOULD
MEAN THAT HIS OWN TURN HAD COME

THE DOOR OPENED THE COLDFACED YOUNG OFFICER STEPPED INTO THE CELL WITH
A BRIEF MOVEMENT OF THE HAND HE INDICATED AMPLEFORTH

ROOM 101 HE SAID

AMPLEFORTH MARCHED CLUMSILY OUT BETWEEN THE GUARDS HIS FACE VAGUELY
PERTURBED BUT UNCOMPREHENDING

WHAT SEEMED LIKE A LONG TIME PASSED THE PAIN IN WINSTONS BELLY HAD
REVIVED HIS MIND SAGGED ROUND AND ROUND ON THE SAME TRICK LIKE A BALL
FALLING AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO THE SAME SERIES OF SLOTS HE HAD ONLY SIX
THOUGHTS THE PAIN IN HIS BELLY A PIECE OF BREAD THE BLOOD AND THE
SCREAMING OBRIEN JULIA THE RAZOR BLADE THERE WAS ANOTHER SPASM IN HIS
ENTRAILS THE HEAVY BOOTS WERE APPROACHING AS THE DOOR OPENED THE WAVE
OF AIR THAT IT CREATED BROUGHT IN A POWERFUL SMELL OF COLD SWEAT PARSONS
WALKED INTO THE CELL HE WAS WEARING KHAKI SHORTS AND A SPORTSSHIRT

THIS TIME WINSTON WAS STARTLED INTO SELFFORGETFULNESS

YOU HERE HE SAID

PARSONS GAVE WINSTON A GLANCE IN WHICH THERE WAS NEITHER INTEREST NOR
SURPRISE BUT ONLY MISERY HE BEGAN WALKING JERKILY UP AND DOWN EVIDENTLY
UNABLE TO KEEP STILL EACH TIME HE STRAIGHTENED HIS PUDGY KNEES IT WAS
APPARENT THAT THEY WERE TREMBLING HIS EYES HAD A WIDEOPEN STARING LOOK
AS THOUGH HE COULD NOT PREVENT HIMSELF FROM GAZING AT SOMETHING IN THE
MIDDLE DISTANCE

WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR SAID WINSTON

THOUGHTCRIME SAID PARSONS ALMOST BLUBBERING THE TONE OF HIS VOICE
IMPLIED AT ONCE A COMPLETE ADMISSION OF HIS GUILT AND A SORT OF INCREDULOUS
HORROR THAT SUCH A WORD COULD BE APPLIED TO HIMSELF HE PAUSED OPPOSITE
WINSTON AND BEGAN EAGERLY APPEALING TO HIM YOU DONT THINK THEYLL SHOOT

TELESCREEN YOU DONT THINK THE PARTY WOULD ARREST AN INNOCENT MAN

WHO DENOUNCED YOU SAID WINSTON

IT WAS MY LITTLE DAUGHTER SAID PARSONS WITH A SORT OF DOLEFUL PRIDE
SHE LISTENED AT THE KEYHOLE HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING AND NIPPED OFF TO
THE PATROLS THE VERY NEXT DAY PRETTY SMART FOR A NIPPER OF SEVEN EH
I DONT BEAR HER ANY GRUDGE FOR IT IN FACT IM PROUD OF HER IT SHOWS I
BROUGHT HER UP IN THE RIGHT SPIRIT ANYWAY

HE MADE A FEW MORE JERKY MOVEMENTS UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES CASTING A
LONGING GLANCE AT THE LAVATORY PAN THEN HE SUDDENLY RIPPED DOWN HIS
SHORTS

EXCUSE ME OLD MAN HE SAID I CANT HELP IT ITS THE WAITING

HE PLUMPED HIS LARGE POSTERIOR INTO THE LAVATORY PAN WINSTON COVERED HIS
FACE WITH HIS HANDS

SMITH YELLED THE VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN 6079 SMITH W UNCOVER YOUR
FACE NO FACES COVERED IN THE CELLS

WINSTON UNCOVERED HIS FACE PARSONS USED THE LAVATORY LOUDLY AND
ABUNDANTLY IT THEN TURNED OUT THAT THE PLUG WAS DEFECTIVE AND THE CELL
STANK ABOMINABLY FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS

PARSONS WAS REMOVED MORE PRISONERS CAME AND WENT MYSTERIOUSLY ONE A
WOMAN WAS CONSIGNED TO ROOM 101 AND WINSTON NOTICED SEEMED TO SHRIVEL
AND TURN A DIFFERENT COLOUR WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORDS A TIME CAME WHEN IF
IT HAD BEEN MORNING WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT HERE IT WOULD BE AFTERNOON OR IF
IT HAD BEEN AFTERNOON THEN IT WOULD BE MIDNIGHT THERE WERE SIX PRISONERS
IN THE CELL MEN AND WOMEN ALL SAT VERY STILL OPPOSITE WINSTON THERE SAT
A MAN WITH A CHINLESS TOOTHY FACE EXACTLY LIKE THAT OF SOME LARGE
HARMLESS RODENT HIS FAT MOTTLED CHEEKS WERE SO POUCHED AT THE BOTTOM
THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT NOT TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD LITTLE STORES OF FOOD
TUCKED AWAY THERE HIS PALEGREY EYES FLITTED TIMOROUSLY FROM FACE TO FACE
AND TURNED QUICKLY AWAY AGAIN WHEN HE CAUGHT ANYONES EYE

THE DOOR OPENED AND ANOTHER PRISONER WAS BROUGHT IN WHOSE APPEARANCE SENT
A MOMENTARY CHILL THROUGH WINSTON HE WAS A COMMONPLACE MEANLOOKING MAN
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ENGINEER OR TECHNICIAN OF SOME KIND BUT WHAT WAS
STARTLING WAS THE EMACIATION OF HIS FACE IT WAS LIKE A SKULL BECAUSE OF
ITS THINNESS THE MOUTH AND EYES LOOKED DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE AND THE
EYES SEEMED FILLED WITH A MURDEROUS UNAPPEASABLE HATRED OF SOMEBODY OR
SOMETHING

THE MAN SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM WINSTON WINSTON
DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AGAIN BUT THE TORMENTED SKULLLIKE FACE WAS AS
VIVID IN HIS MIND AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS EYES
SUDDENLY HE REALIZED WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE MAN WAS DYING OF STARVATION
THE SAME THOUGHT SEEMED TO OCCUR ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY TO EVERYONE IN THE
CELL THERE WAS A VERY FAINT STIRRING ALL THE WAY ROUND THE BENCH THE
EYES OF THE CHINLESS MAN KEPT FLITTING TOWARDS THE SKULLFACED MAN THEN
TURNING GUILTILY AWAY THEN BEING DRAGGED BACK BY AN IRRESISTIBLE
ATTRACTION PRESENTLY HE BEGAN TO FIDGET ON HIS SEAT AT LAST HE STOOD UP
WADDLED CLUMSILY ACROSS THE CELL DUG DOWN INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERALLS
AND WITH AN ABASHED AIR HELD OUT A GRIMY PIECE OF BREAD TO THE
SKULLFACED MAN

THERE WAS A FURIOUS DEAFENING ROAR FROM THE TELESCREEN THE CHINLESS MAN
JUMPED IN HIS TRACKS THE SKULLFACED MAN HAD QUICKLY THRUST HIS HANDS
BEHIND HIS BACK AS THOUGH DEMONSTRATING TO ALL THE WORLD THAT HE REFUSED
THE GIFT

BUMSTEAD ROARED THE VOICE 2713 BUMSTEAD J LET FALL THAT PIECE OF
BREAD

THE CHINLESS MAN DROPPED THE PIECE OF BREAD ON THE FLOOR

REMAIN STANDING WHERE YOU ARE SAID THE VOICE FACE THE DOOR MAKE NO
MOVEMENT

THE CHINLESS MAN OBEYED HIS LARGE POUCHY CHEEKS WERE QUIVERING
UNCONTROLLABLY THE DOOR CLANGED OPEN AS THE YOUNG OFFICER ENTERED AND
STEPPED ASIDE THERE EMERGED FROM BEHIND HIM A SHORT STUMPY GUARD WITH
ENORMOUS ARMS AND SHOULDERS HE TOOK HIS STAND OPPOSITE THE CHINLESS MAN
AND THEN AT A SIGNAL FROM THE OFFICER LET FREE A FRIGHTFUL BLOW WITH
ALL THE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY BEHIND IT FULL IN THE CHINLESS MANS MOUTH
THE FORCE OF IT SEEMED ALMOST TO KNOCK HIM CLEAR OF THE FLOOR HIS BODY
WAS FLUNG ACROSS THE CELL AND FETCHED UP AGAINST THE BASE OF THE LAVATORY
SEAT FOR A MOMENT HE LAY AS THOUGH STUNNED WITH DARK BLOOD OOZING FROM
HIS MOUTH AND NOSE A VERY FAINT WHIMPERING OR SQUEAKING WHICH SEEMED
UNCONSCIOUS CAME OUT OF HIM THEN HE ROLLED OVER AND RAISED HIMSELF
UNSTEADILY ON HANDS AND KNEES AMID A STREAM OF BLOOD AND SALIVA THE TWO
HALVES OF A DENTAL PLATE FELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH

THE PRISONERS SAT VERY STILL THEIR HANDS CROSSED ON THEIR KNEES THE
CHINLESS MAN CLIMBED BACK INTO HIS PLACE DOWN ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE THE
FLESH WAS DARKENING HIS MOUTH HAD SWOLLEN INTO A SHAPELESS CHERRYCOLOURED
MASS WITH A BLACK HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT

FROM TIME TO TIME A LITTLE BLOOD DRIPPED ON TO THE BREAST OF HIS OVERALLS
HIS GREY EYES STILL FLITTED FROM FACE TO FACE MORE GUILTILY THAN EVER
AS THOUGH HE WERE TRYING TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH THE OTHERS DESPISED HIM FOR
HIS HUMILIATION

THE DOOR OPENED WITH A SMALL GESTURE THE OFFICER INDICATED THE
SKULLFACED MAN

ROOM 101 HE SAID

THERE WAS A GASP AND A FLURRY AT WINSTONS SIDE THE MAN HAD ACTUALLY
FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS HAND CLASPED TOGETHER

COMRADE OFFICER HE CRIED YOU DONT HAVE TO TAKE ME TO THAT PLACE
HAVENT I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING ALREADY WHAT ELSE IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW
THERES NOTHING I WOULDNT CONFESS NOTHING JUST TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND
ILL CONFESS STRAIGHT OFF WRITE IT DOWN AND ILL SIGN ITANYTHING
NOT ROOM 101

ROOM 101 SAID THE OFFICER

THE MANS FACE ALREADY VERY PALE TURNED A COLOUR WINSTON WOULD NOT HAVE
BELIEVED POSSIBLE IT WAS DEFINITELY UNMISTAKABLY A SHADE OF GREEN

DO ANYTHING TO ME HE YELLED YOUVE BEEN STARVING ME FOR WEEKS FINISH
IT OFF AND LET ME DIE SHOOT ME HANG ME SENTENCE ME TO TWENTYFIVE
YEARS IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE YOU WANT ME TO GIVE AWAY JUST SAY WHO IT IS
AND ILL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT I DONT CARE WHO IT IS OR WHAT YOU DO
TO THEM IVE GOT A WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN THE BIGGEST OF THEM ISNT SIX
YEARS OLD YOU CAN TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM AND CUT THEIR THROATS IN
FRONT OF MY EYES AND ILL STAND BY AND WATCH IT BUT NOT ROOM 101

ROOM 101 SAID THE OFFICER

THE MAN LOOKED FRANTICALLY ROUND AT THE OTHER PRISONERS AS THOUGH WITH
SOME IDEA THAT HE COULD PUT ANOTHER VICTIM IN HIS OWN PLACE HIS EYES
SETTLED ON THE SMASHED FACE OF THE CHINLESS MAN HE FLUNG OUT A LEAN ARM

THATS THE ONE YOU OUGHT TO BE TAKING NOT ME HE SHOUTED YOU DIDNT
HEAR WHAT HE WAS SAYING AFTER THEY BASHED HIS FACE GIVE ME A CHANCE AND
ILL TELL YOU EVERY WORD OF IT HES THE ONE THATS AGAINST THE PARTY NOT
ME THE GUARDS STEPPED FORWARD THE MANS VOICE ROSE TO A SHRIEK YOU
DIDNT HEAR HIM HE REPEATED SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE TELESCREEN
HES THE ONE YOU WANT TAKE HIM NOT ME

THE TWO STURDY GUARDS HAD STOOPED TO TAKE HIM BY THE ARMS BUT JUST AT
THIS MOMENT HE FLUNG HIMSELF ACROSS THE FLOOR OF THE CELL AND GRABBED ONE
OF THE IRON LEGS THAT SUPPORTED THE BENCH HE HAD SET UP A WORDLESS
HOWLING LIKE AN ANIMAL THE GUARDS TOOK HOLD OF HIM TO WRENCH HIM LOOSE
BUT HE CLUNG ON WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH FOR PERHAPS TWENTY SECONDS
THEY WERE HAULING AT HIM THE PRISONERS SAT QUIET THEIR HANDS CROSSED ON
THEIR KNEES LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM THE HOWLING STOPPED THE
MAN HAD NO BREATH LEFT FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT HANGING ON THEN THERE WAS A
DIFFERENT KIND OF CRY A KICK FROM A GUARDS BOOT HAD BROKEN THE FINGERS
OF ONE OF HIS HANDS THEY DRAGGED HIM TO HIS FEET

ROOM 101 SAID THE OFFICER

THE MAN WAS LED OUT WALKING UNSTEADILY WITH HEAD SUNKEN NURSING HIS
CRUSHED HAND ALL THE FIGHT HAD GONE OUT OF HIM

A LONG TIME PASSED IF IT HAD BEEN MIDNIGHT WHEN THE SKULLFACED MAN WAS
TAKEN AWAY IT WAS MORNING IF MORNING IT WAS AFTERNOON WINSTON WAS
ALONE AND HAD BEEN ALONE FOR HOURS THE PAIN OF SITTING ON THE NARROW
BENCH WAS SUCH THAT OFTEN HE GOT UP AND WALKED ABOUT UNREPROVED BY THE
TELESCREEN THE PIECE OF BREAD STILL LAY WHERE THE CHINLESS MAN HAD
DROPPED IT AT THE BEGINNING IT NEEDED A HARD EFFORT NOT TO LOOK AT IT
BUT PRESENTLY HUNGER GAVE WAY TO THIRST HIS MOUTH WAS STICKY AND
EVILTASTING THE HUMMING SOUND AND THE UNVARYING WHITE LIGHT INDUCED A
SORT OF FAINTNESS AN EMPTY FEELING INSIDE HIS HEAD HE WOULD GET UP
BECAUSE THE ACHE IN HIS BONES WAS NO LONGER BEARABLE AND THEN WOULD SIT
DOWN AGAIN ALMOST AT ONCE BECAUSE HE WAS TOO DIZZY TO MAKE SURE OF
STAYING ON HIS FEET WHENEVER HIS PHYSICAL SENSATIONS WERE A LITTLE UNDER
CONTROL THE TERROR RETURNED SOMETIMES WITH A FADING HOPE HE THOUGHT OF
OBRIEN AND THE RAZOR BLADE IT WAS THINKABLE THAT THE RAZOR BLADE MIGHT
ARRIVE CONCEALED IN HIS FOOD IF HE WERE EVER FED MORE DIMLY HE THOUGHT
OF JULIA SOMEWHERE OR OTHER SHE WAS SUFFERING PERHAPS FAR WORSE THAN HE
SHE MIGHT BE SCREAMING WITH PAIN AT THIS MOMENT HE THOUGHT IF I COULD
SAVE JULIA BY DOUBLING MY OWN PAIN WOULD I DO IT YES I WOULD BUT THAT
WAS MERELY AN INTELLECTUAL DECISION TAKEN BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE OUGHT
TO TAKE IT HE DID NOT FEEL IT IN THIS PLACE YOU COULD NOT FEEL ANYTHING
EXCEPT PAIN AND FOREKNOWLEDGE OF PAIN BESIDES WAS IT POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
WERE ACTUALLY SUFFERING IT TO WISH FOR ANY REASON THAT YOUR OWN PAIN
SHOULD INCREASE BUT THAT QUESTION WAS NOT ANSWERABLE YET

THE BOOTS WERE APPROACHING AGAIN THE DOOR OPENED OBRIEN CAME IN

WINSTON STARTED TO HIS FEET THE SHOCK OF THE SIGHT HAD DRIVEN ALL
CAUTION OUT OF HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS HE FORGOT THE
PRESENCE OF THE TELESCREEN

THEYVE GOT YOU TOO HE CRIED

THEY GOT ME A LONG TIME AGO SAID OBRIEN WITH A MILD ALMOST REGRETFUL
IRONY HE STEPPED ASIDE FROM BEHIND HIM THERE EMERGED A BROADCHESTED
GUARD WITH A LONG BLACK TRUNCHEON IN HIS HAND

YOU KNOW THIS WINSTON SAID OBRIEN DONT DECEIVE YOURSELF YOU DID
KNOW ITYOU HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN IT

YES HE SAW NOW HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN IT BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF
THAT ALL HE HAD EYES FOR WAS THE TRUNCHEON IN THE GUARDS HAND IT MIGHT
FALL ANYWHERE ON THE CROWN ON THE TIP OF THE EAR ON THE UPPER ARM ON
THE ELBOW

THE ELBOW HE HAD SLUMPED TO HIS KNEES ALMOST PARALYSED CLASPING THE
STRICKEN ELBOW WITH HIS OTHER HAND EVERYTHING HAD EXPLODED INTO YELLOW
LIGHT INCONCEIVABLE INCONCEIVABLE THAT ONE BLOW COULD CAUSE SUCH PAIN
THE LIGHT CLEARED AND HE COULD SEE THE OTHER TWO LOOKING DOWN AT HIM THE
GUARD WAS LAUGHING AT HIS CONTORTIONS ONE QUESTION AT ANY RATE WAS
ANSWERED NEVER FOR ANY REASON ON EARTH COULD YOU WISH FOR AN INCREASE
OF PAIN OF PAIN YOU COULD WISH ONLY ONE THING THAT IT SHOULD STOP
NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS SO BAD AS PHYSICAL PAIN IN THE FACE OF PAIN
THERE ARE NO HEROES NO HEROES HE THOUGHT OVER AND OVER AS HE WRITHED
ON THE FLOOR CLUTCHING USELESSLY AT HIS DISABLED LEFT ARM




CHAPTER 2



HE WAS LYING ON SOMETHING THAT FELT LIKE A CAMP BED EXCEPT THAT IT WAS
HIGHER OFF THE GROUND AND THAT HE WAS FIXED DOWN IN SOME WAY SO THAT HE
COULD NOT MOVE LIGHT THAT SEEMED STRONGER THAN USUAL WAS FALLING ON HIS
FACE OBRIEN WAS STANDING AT HIS SIDE LOOKING DOWN AT HIM INTENTLY AT
THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM STOOD A MAN IN A WHITE COAT HOLDING A HYPODERMIC
SYRINGE

EVEN AFTER HIS EYES WERE OPEN HE TOOK IN HIS SURROUNDINGS ONLY GRADUALLY
HE HAD THE IMPRESSION OF SWIMMING UP INTO THIS ROOM FROM SOME QUITE
DIFFERENT WORLD A SORT OF UNDERWATER WORLD FAR BENEATH IT HOW LONG HE
HAD BEEN DOWN THERE HE DID NOT KNOW SINCE THE MOMENT WHEN THEY ARRESTED
HIM HE HAD NOT SEEN DARKNESS OR DAYLIGHT BESIDES HIS MEMORIES WERE NOT
CONTINUOUS THERE HAD BEEN TIMES WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS EVEN THE SORT OF
CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ONE HAS IN SLEEP HAD STOPPED DEAD AND STARTED AGAIN
AFTER A BLANK INTERVAL BUT WHETHER THE INTERVALS WERE OF DAYS OR WEEKS
OR ONLY SECONDS THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING

WITH THAT FIRST BLOW ON THE ELBOW THE NIGHTMARE HAD STARTED LATER HE WAS
TO REALIZE THAT ALL THAT THEN HAPPENED WAS MERELY A PRELIMINARY A ROUTINE
INTERROGATION TO WHICH NEARLY ALL PRISONERS WERE SUBJECTED THERE WAS A
LONG RANGE OF CRIMESESPIONAGE SABOTAGE AND THE LIKETO WHICH EVERYONE
HAD TO CONFESS AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE CONFESSION WAS A FORMALITY
THOUGH THE TORTURE WAS REAL HOW MANY TIMES HE HAD BEEN BEATEN HOW LONG
THE BEATINGS HAD CONTINUED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER ALWAYS THERE WERE FIVE
OR SIX MEN IN BLACK UNIFORMS AT HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY SOMETIMES IT WAS
FISTS SOMETIMES IT WAS TRUNCHEONS SOMETIMES IT WAS STEEL RODS SOMETIMES
IT WAS BOOTS THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE ROLLED ABOUT THE FLOOR AS SHAMELESS
AS AN ANIMAL WRITHING HIS BODY THIS WAY AND THAT IN AN ENDLESS HOPELESS
EFFORT TO DODGE THE KICKS AND SIMPLY INVITING MORE AND YET MORE KICKS
IN HIS RIBS IN HIS BELLY ON HIS ELBOWS ON HIS SHINS IN HIS GROIN
IN HIS TESTICLES ON THE BONE AT THE BASE OF HIS SPINE THERE WERE TIMES
WHEN IT WENT ON AND ON UNTIL THE CRUEL WICKED UNFORGIVABLE THING SEEMED
TO HIM NOT THAT THE GUARDS CONTINUED TO BEAT HIM BUT THAT HE COULD NOT
FORCE HIMSELF INTO LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HIS NERVE
SO FORSOOK HIM THAT HE BEGAN SHOUTING FOR MERCY EVEN BEFORE THE BEATING
BEGAN WHEN THE MERE SIGHT OF A FIST DRAWN BACK FOR A BLOW WAS ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM POUR FORTH A CONFESSION OF REAL AND IMAGINARY CRIMES THERE
WERE OTHER TIMES WHEN HE STARTED OUT WITH THE RESOLVE OF CONFESSING
NOTHING WHEN EVERY WORD HAD TO BE FORCED OUT OF HIM BETWEEN GASPS OF
PAIN AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE FEEBLY TRIED TO COMPROMISE WHEN HE
SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL CONFESS BUT NOT YET I MUST HOLD OUT TILL THE
PAIN BECOMES UNBEARABLE THREE MORE KICKS TWO MORE KICKS AND THEN I WILL
TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT SOMETIMES HE WAS BEATEN TILL HE COULD HARDLY
STAND THEN FLUNG LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES ON TO THE STONE FLOOR OF A CELL
LEFT TO RECUPERATE FOR A FEW HOURS AND THEN TAKEN OUT AND BEATEN AGAIN
THERE WERE ALSO LONGER PERIODS OF RECOVERY HE REMEMBERED THEM DIMLY
BECAUSE THEY WERE SPENT CHIEFLY IN SLEEP OR STUPOR HE REMEMBERED A CELL
WITH A PLANK BED A SORT OF SHELF STICKING OUT FROM THE WALL AND A TIN
WASHBASIN AND MEALS OF HOT SOUP AND BREAD AND SOMETIMES COFFEE HE
REMEMBERED A SURLY BARBER ARRIVING TO SCRAPE HIS CHIN AND CROP HIS HAIR
AND BUSINESSLIKE UNSYMPATHETIC MEN IN WHITE COATS FEELING HIS PULSE
TAPPING HIS REFLEXES TURNING UP HIS EYELIDS RUNNING HARSH FINGERS OVER
HIM IN SEARCH FOR BROKEN BONES AND SHOOTING NEEDLES INTO HIS ARM TO MAKE
HIM SLEEP

THE BEATINGS GREW LESS FREQUENT AND BECAME MAINLY A THREAT A HORROR
TO WHICH HE COULD BE SENT BACK AT ANY MOMENT WHEN HIS ANSWERS WERE
UNSATISFACTORY HIS QUESTIONERS NOW WERE NOT RUFFIANS IN BLACK UNIFORMS
BUT PARTY INTELLECTUALS LITTLE ROTUND MEN WITH QUICK MOVEMENTS AND
FLASHING SPECTACLES WHO WORKED ON HIM IN RELAYS OVER PERIODS WHICH
LASTEDHE THOUGHT HE COULD NOT BE SURETEN OR TWELVE HOURS AT A STRETCH
THESE OTHER QUESTIONERS SAW TO IT THAT HE WAS IN CONSTANT SLIGHT PAIN BUT
IT WAS NOT CHIEFLY PAIN THAT THEY RELIED ON THEY SLAPPED HIS FACE WRUNG
HIS EARS PULLED HIS HAIR MADE HIM STAND ON ONE LEG REFUSED HIM LEAVE TO
URINATE SHONE GLARING LIGHTS IN HIS FACE UNTIL HIS EYES RAN WITH WATER
BUT THE AIM OF THIS WAS SIMPLY TO HUMILIATE HIM AND DESTROY HIS POWER OF
ARGUING AND REASONING THEIR REAL WEAPON WAS THE MERCILESS QUESTIONING
THAT WENT ON AND ON HOUR AFTER HOUR TRIPPING HIM UP LAYING TRAPS FOR
HIM TWISTING EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID CONVICTING HIM AT EVERY STEP OF
LIES AND SELFCONTRADICTION UNTIL HE BEGAN WEEPING AS MUCH FROM SHAME AS
FROM NERVOUS FATIGUE SOMETIMES HE WOULD WEEP HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN A
SINGLE SESSION MOST OF THE TIME THEY SCREAMED ABUSE AT HIM AND THREATENED
AT EVERY HESITATION TO DELIVER HIM OVER TO THE GUARDS AGAIN BUT SOMETIMES
THEY WOULD SUDDENLY CHANGE THEIR TUNE CALL HIM COMRADE APPEAL TO HIM IN
THE NAME OF INGSOC AND BIG BROTHER AND ASK HIM SORROWFULLY WHETHER EVEN
NOW HE HAD NOT ENOUGH LOYALTY TO THE PARTY LEFT TO MAKE HIM WISH TO
UNDO THE EVIL HE HAD DONE WHEN HIS NERVES WERE IN RAGS AFTER HOURS OF
QUESTIONING EVEN THIS APPEAL COULD REDUCE HIM TO SNIVELLING TEARS IN THE
END THE NAGGING VOICES BROKE HIM DOWN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THE BOOTS AND
FISTS OF THE GUARDS HE BECAME SIMPLY A MOUTH THAT UTTERED A HAND THAT
SIGNED WHATEVER WAS DEMANDED OF HIM HIS SOLE CONCERN WAS TO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WANTED HIM TO CONFESS AND THEN CONFESS IT QUICKLY BEFORE THE
BULLYING STARTED ANEW HE CONFESSED TO THE ASSASSINATION OF EMINENT PARTY
MEMBERS THE DISTRIBUTION OF SEDITIOUS PAMPHLETS EMBEZZLEMENT OF PUBLIC
FUNDS SALE OF MILITARY SECRETS SABOTAGE OF EVERY KIND HE CONFESSED THAT
HE HAD BEEN A SPY IN THE PAY OF THE EASTASIAN GOVERNMENT AS FAR BACK AS
1968 HE CONFESSED THAT HE WAS A RELIGIOUS BELIEVER AN ADMIRER OF
CAPITALISM AND A SEXUAL PERVERT HE CONFESSED THAT HE HAD MURDERED HIS
WIFE ALTHOUGH HE KNEW AND HIS QUESTIONERS MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT HIS WIFE
WAS STILL ALIVE HE CONFESSED THAT FOR YEARS HE HAD BEEN IN PERSONAL TOUCH
WITH GOLDSTEIN AND HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF AN UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION WHICH
HAD INCLUDED ALMOST EVERY HUMAN BEING HE HAD EVER KNOWN IT WAS EASIER TO
CONFESS EVERYTHING AND IMPLICATE EVERYBODY BESIDES IN A SENSE IT WAS ALL
TRUE IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD BEEN THE ENEMY OF THE PARTY AND IN THE EYES
OF THE PARTY THERE WAS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THOUGHT AND THE DEED

THERE WERE ALSO MEMORIES OF ANOTHER KIND THEY STOOD OUT IN HIS MIND
DISCONNECTEDLY LIKE PICTURES WITH BLACKNESS ALL ROUND THEM

HE WAS IN A CELL WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER DARK OR LIGHT BECAUSE HE
COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT A PAIR OF EYES NEAR AT HAND SOME KIND OF
INSTRUMENT WAS TICKING SLOWLY AND REGULARLY THE EYES GREW LARGER AND MORE
LUMINOUS SUDDENLY HE FLOATED OUT OF HIS SEAT DIVED INTO THE EYES AND
WAS SWALLOWED UP

HE WAS STRAPPED INTO A CHAIR SURROUNDED BY DIALS UNDER DAZZLING LIGHTS
A MAN IN A WHITE COAT WAS READING THE DIALS THERE WAS A TRAMP OF HEAVY
BOOTS OUTSIDE THE DOOR CLANGED OPEN THE WAXEDFACED OFFICER MARCHED IN
FOLLOWED BY TWO GUARDS

ROOM 101 SAID THE OFFICER

THE MAN IN THE WHITE COAT DID NOT TURN ROUND HE DID NOT LOOK AT WINSTON
EITHER HE WAS LOOKING ONLY AT THE DIALS

HE WAS ROLLING DOWN A MIGHTY CORRIDOR A KILOMETRE WIDE FULL OF GLORIOUS
GOLDEN LIGHT ROARING WITH LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING OUT CONFESSIONS AT THE
TOP OF HIS VOICE HE WAS CONFESSING EVERYTHING EVEN THE THINGS HE HAD
SUCCEEDED IN HOLDING BACK UNDER THE TORTURE HE WAS RELATING THE ENTIRE
HISTORY OF HIS LIFE TO AN AUDIENCE WHO KNEW IT ALREADY WITH HIM WERE THE
GUARDS THE OTHER QUESTIONERS THE MEN IN WHITE COATS OBRIEN JULIA
MR CHARRINGTON ALL ROLLING DOWN THE CORRIDOR TOGETHER AND SHOUTING WITH
LAUGHTER SOME DREADFUL THING WHICH HAD LAIN EMBEDDED IN THE FUTURE HAD
SOMEHOW BEEN SKIPPED OVER AND HAD NOT HAPPENED EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT
THERE WAS NO MORE PAIN THE LAST DETAIL OF HIS LIFE WAS LAID BARE
UNDERSTOOD FORGIVEN

HE WAS STARTING UP FROM THE PLANK BED IN THE HALFCERTAINTY THAT HE HAD
HEARD OBRIENS VOICE ALL THROUGH HIS INTERROGATION ALTHOUGH HE HAD
NEVER SEEN HIM HE HAD HAD THE FEELING THAT OBRIEN WAS AT HIS ELBOW JUST
OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS OBRIEN WHO WAS DIRECTING EVERYTHING IT WAS HE WHO
SET THE GUARDS ON TO WINSTON AND WHO PREVENTED THEM FROM KILLING HIM IT
WAS HE WHO DECIDED WHEN WINSTON SHOULD SCREAM WITH PAIN WHEN HE SHOULD
HAVE A RESPITE WHEN HE SHOULD BE FED WHEN HE SHOULD SLEEP WHEN THE
DRUGS SHOULD BE PUMPED INTO HIS ARM IT WAS HE WHO ASKED THE QUESTIONS AND
SUGGESTED THE ANSWERS HE WAS THE TORMENTOR HE WAS THE PROTECTOR HE WAS
THE INQUISITOR HE WAS THE FRIEND AND ONCEWINSTON COULD NOT REMEMBER
WHETHER IT WAS IN DRUGGED SLEEP OR IN NORMAL SLEEP OR EVEN IN A MOMENT
OF WAKEFULNESSA VOICE MURMURED IN HIS EAR DONT WORRY WINSTON YOU
ARE IN MY KEEPING FOR SEVEN YEARS I HAVE WATCHED OVER YOU NOW THE
TURNINGPOINT HAS COME I SHALL SAVE YOU I SHALL MAKE YOU PERFECT HE
WAS NOT SURE WHETHER IT WAS OBRIENS VOICE BUT IT WAS THE SAME VOICE
THAT HAD SAID TO HIM WE SHALL MEET IN THE PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO
DARKNESS IN THAT OTHER DREAM SEVEN YEARS AGO

HE DID NOT REMEMBER ANY ENDING TO HIS INTERROGATION THERE WAS A PERIOD OF
BLACKNESS AND THEN THE CELL OR ROOM IN WHICH HE NOW WAS HAD GRADUALLY
MATERIALIZED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALMOST FLAT ON HIS BACK AND UNABLE TO MOVE
HIS BODY WAS HELD DOWN AT EVERY ESSENTIAL POINT EVEN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
WAS GRIPPED IN SOME MANNER OBRIEN WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HIM GRAVELY AND
RATHER SADLY HIS FACE SEEN FROM BELOW LOOKED COARSE AND WORN WITH
POUCHES UNDER THE EYES AND TIRED LINES FROM NOSE TO CHIN HE WAS OLDER
THAN WINSTON HAD THOUGHT HIM HE WAS PERHAPS FORTYEIGHT OR FIFTY UNDER
HIS HAND THERE WAS A DIAL WITH A LEVER ON TOP AND FIGURES RUNNING ROUND
THE FACE

I TOLD YOU SAID OBRIEN THAT IF WE MET AGAIN IT WOULD BE HERE

YES SAID WINSTON

WITHOUT ANY WARNING EXCEPT A SLIGHT MOVEMENT OF OBRIENS HAND A WAVE OF
PAIN FLOODED HIS BODY IT WAS A FRIGHTENING PAIN BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SEE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND HE HAD THE FEELING THAT SOME MORTAL INJURY WAS
BEING DONE TO HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE THING WAS REALLY HAPPENING
OR WHETHER THE EFFECT WAS ELECTRICALLY PRODUCED BUT HIS BODY WAS BEING
WRENCHED OUT OF SHAPE THE JOINTS WERE BEING SLOWLY TORN APART ALTHOUGH
THE PAIN HAD BROUGHT THE SWEAT OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD THE WORST OF ALL WAS
THE FEAR THAT HIS BACKBONE WAS ABOUT TO SNAP HE SET HIS TEETH AND
BREATHED HARD THROUGH HIS NOSE TRYING TO KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

YOU ARE AFRAID SAID OBRIEN WATCHING HIS FACE THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT
SOMETHING IS GOING TO BREAK YOUR ESPECIAL FEAR IS THAT IT WILL BE YOUR
BACKBONE YOU HAVE A VIVID MENTAL PICTURE OF THE VERTEBRAE SNAPPING APART
AND THE SPINAL FLUID DRIPPING OUT OF THEM THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE THINKING
IS IT NOT WINSTON

WINSTON DID NOT ANSWER OBRIEN DREW BACK THE LEVER ON THE DIAL THE WAVE
OF PAIN RECEDED ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS IT HAD COME

THAT WAS FORTY SAID OBRIEN YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NUMBERS ON THIS DIAL
RUN UP TO A HUNDRED WILL YOU PLEASE REMEMBER THROUGHOUT OUR CONVERSATION
THAT I HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO INFLICT PAIN ON YOU AT ANY MOMENT AND TO
WHATEVER DEGREE I CHOOSE IF YOU TELL ME ANY LIES OR ATTEMPT TO
PREVARICATE IN ANY WAY OR EVEN FALL BELOW YOUR USUAL LEVEL OF
INTELLIGENCE YOU WILL CRY OUT WITH PAIN INSTANTLY DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT

YES SAID WINSTON

OBRIENS MANNER BECAME LESS SEVERE HE RESETTLED HIS SPECTACLES
THOUGHTFULLY AND TOOK A PACE OR TWO UP AND DOWN WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE
WAS GENTLE AND PATIENT HE HAD THE AIR OF A DOCTOR A TEACHER EVEN A
PRIEST ANXIOUS TO EXPLAIN AND PERSUADE RATHER THAN TO PUNISH

I AM TAKING TROUBLE WITH YOU WINSTON HE SAID BECAUSE YOU ARE WORTH
TROUBLE YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU HAVE
KNOWN IT FOR YEARS THOUGH YOU HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THE KNOWLEDGE YOU ARE
MENTALLY DERANGED YOU SUFFER FROM A DEFECTIVE MEMORY YOU ARE UNABLE TO
REMEMBER REAL EVENTS AND YOU PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT YOU REMEMBER OTHER
EVENTS WHICH NEVER HAPPENED FORTUNATELY IT IS CURABLE YOU HAVE NEVER
CURED YOURSELF OF IT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT CHOOSE TO THERE WAS A SMALL
EFFORT OF THE WILL THAT YOU WERE NOT READY TO MAKE EVEN NOW I AM WELL
AWARE YOU ARE CLINGING TO YOUR DISEASE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IS
A VIRTUE NOW WE WILL TAKE AN EXAMPLE AT THIS MOMENT WHICH POWER IS
OCEANIA AT WAR WITH

WHEN I WAS ARRESTED OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EASTASIA

WITH EASTASIA GOOD AND OCEANIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH EASTASIA
HAS IT NOT

WINSTON DREW IN HIS BREATH HE OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK AND THEN DID NOT
SPEAK HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES AWAY FROM THE DIAL

THE TRUTH PLEASE WINSTON YOUR TRUTH TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK YOU
REMEMBER

I REMEMBER THAT UNTIL ONLY A WEEK BEFORE I WAS ARRESTED WE WERE NOT AT
WAR WITH EASTASIA AT ALL WE WERE IN ALLIANCE WITH THEM THE WAR WAS
AGAINST EURASIA THAT HAD LASTED FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE THAT

OBRIEN STOPPED HIM WITH A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND

ANOTHER EXAMPLE HE SAID SOME YEARS AGO YOU HAD A VERY SERIOUS DELUSION
INDEED YOU BELIEVED THAT THREE MEN THREE ONETIME PARTY MEMBERS NAMED
JONES AARONSON AND RUTHERFORDMEN WHO WERE EXECUTED FOR TREACHERY AND
SABOTAGE AFTER MAKING THE FULLEST POSSIBLE CONFESSIONWERE NOT GUILTY OF
THE CRIMES THEY WERE CHARGED WITH YOU BELIEVED THAT YOU HAD SEEN
UNMISTAKABLE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE PROVING THAT THEIR CONFESSIONS WERE
FALSE THERE WAS A CERTAIN PHOTOGRAPH ABOUT WHICH YOU HAD A HALLUCINATION
YOU BELIEVED THAT YOU HAD ACTUALLY HELD IT IN YOUR HANDS IT WAS A
PHOTOGRAPH SOMETHING LIKE THIS

AN OBLONG SLIP OF NEWSPAPER HAD APPEARED BETWEEN OBRIENS FINGERS FOR
PERHAPS FIVE SECONDS IT WAS WITHIN THE ANGLE OF WINSTONS VISION IT WAS
A PHOTOGRAPH AND THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF ITS IDENTITY IT WAS THE
PHOTOGRAPH IT WAS ANOTHER COPY OF THE PHOTOGRAPH OF JONES AARONSON AND
RUTHERFORD AT THE PARTY FUNCTION IN NEW YORK WHICH HE HAD CHANCED UPON
ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND PROMPTLY DESTROYED FOR ONLY AN INSTANT IT WAS BEFORE
HIS EYES THEN IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT AGAIN BUT HE HAD SEEN IT
UNQUESTIONABLY HE HAD SEEN IT HE MADE A DESPERATE AGONIZING EFFORT TO
WRENCH THE TOP HALF OF HIS BODY FREE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE SO MUCH AS
A CENTIMETRE IN ANY DIRECTION FOR THE MOMENT HE HAD EVEN FORGOTTEN THE
DIAL ALL HE WANTED WAS TO HOLD THE PHOTOGRAPH IN HIS FINGERS AGAIN OR AT
LEAST TO SEE IT

IT EXISTS HE CRIED

NO SAID OBRIEN

HE STEPPED ACROSS THE ROOM THERE WAS A MEMORY HOLE IN THE OPPOSITE WALL
OBRIEN LIFTED THE GRATING UNSEEN THE FRAIL SLIP OF PAPER WAS WHIRLING
AWAY ON THE CURRENT OF WARM AIR IT WAS VANISHING IN A FLASH OF FLAME
OBRIEN TURNED AWAY FROM THE WALL

ASHES HE SAID NOT EVEN IDENTIFIABLE ASHES DUST IT DOES NOT EXIST
IT NEVER EXISTED

BUT IT DID EXIST IT DOES EXIST IT EXISTS IN MEMORY I REMEMBER IT
YOU REMEMBER IT

I DO NOT REMEMBER IT SAID OBRIEN

WINSTONS HEART SANK THAT WAS DOUBLETHINK HE HAD A FEELING OF DEADLY
HELPLESSNESS IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN CERTAIN THAT OBRIEN WAS LYING IT
WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED TO MATTER BUT IT WAS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT OBRIEN
HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN THE PHOTOGRAPH AND IF SO THEN ALREADY HE WOULD HAVE
FORGOTTEN HIS DENIAL OF REMEMBERING IT AND FORGOTTEN THE ACT OF
FORGETTING HOW COULD ONE BE SURE THAT IT WAS SIMPLE TRICKERY PERHAPS
THAT LUNATIC DISLOCATION IN THE MIND COULD REALLY HAPPEN THAT WAS THE
THOUGHT THAT DEFEATED HIM

OBRIEN WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HIM SPECULATIVELY MORE THAN EVER HE HAD THE
AIR OF A TEACHER TAKING PAINS WITH A WAYWARD BUT PROMISING CHILD

THERE IS A PARTY SLOGAN DEALING WITH THE CONTROL OF THE PAST HE SAID
REPEAT IT IF YOU PLEASE

WHO CONTROLS THE PAST CONTROLS THE FUTURE WHO CONTROLS THE PRESENT
CONTROLS THE PAST REPEATED WINSTON OBEDIENTLY

WHO CONTROLS THE PRESENT CONTROLS THE PAST SAID OBRIEN NODDING HIS
HEAD WITH SLOW APPROVAL IS IT YOUR OPINION WINSTON THAT THE PAST HAS
REAL EXISTENCE

AGAIN THE FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS DESCENDED UPON WINSTON HIS EYES FLITTED
TOWARDS THE DIAL HE NOT ONLY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER YES OR NO WAS THE
ANSWER THAT WOULD SAVE HIM FROM PAIN HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHICH ANSWER HE
BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUE ONE

OBRIEN SMILED FAINTLY YOU ARE NO METAPHYSICIAN WINSTON HE SAID
UNTIL THIS MOMENT YOU HAD NEVER CONSIDERED WHAT IS MEANT BY EXISTENCE I
WILL PUT IT MORE PRECISELY DOES THE PAST EXIST CONCRETELY IN SPACE IS
THERE SOMEWHERE OR OTHER A PLACE A WORLD OF SOLID OBJECTS WHERE THE PAST
IS STILL HAPPENING

NO

THEN WHERE DOES THE PAST EXIST IF AT ALL

IN RECORDS IT IS WRITTEN DOWN

IN RECORDS AND

IN THE MIND IN HUMAN MEMORIES

IN MEMORY VERY WELL THEN WE THE PARTY CONTROL ALL RECORDS AND WE
CONTROL ALL MEMORIES THEN WE CONTROL THE PAST DO WE NOT

BUT HOW CAN YOU STOP PEOPLE REMEMBERING THINGS CRIED WINSTON AGAIN
MOMENTARILY FORGETTING THE DIAL IT IS INVOLUNTARY IT IS OUTSIDE ONESELF
HOW CAN YOU CONTROL MEMORY YOU HAVE NOT CONTROLLED MINE

OBRIENS MANNER GREW STERN AGAIN HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE DIAL

ON THE CONTRARY HE SAID YOU HAVE NOT CONTROLLED IT THAT IS WHAT HAS
BROUGHT YOU HERE YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILED IN HUMILITY IN
SELFDISCIPLINE YOU WOULD NOT MAKE THE ACT OF SUBMISSION WHICH IS THE
PRICE OF SANITY YOU PREFERRED TO BE A LUNATIC A MINORITY OF ONE ONLY THE
DISCIPLINED MIND CAN SEE REALITY WINSTON YOU BELIEVE THAT REALITY IS
SOMETHING OBJECTIVE EXTERNAL EXISTING IN ITS OWN RIGHT YOU ALSO BELIEVE
THAT THE NATURE OF REALITY IS SELFEVIDENT WHEN YOU DELUDE YOURSELF INTO
THINKING THAT YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU ASSUME THAT EVERYONE ELSE SEES THE
SAME THING AS YOU BUT I TELL YOU WINSTON THAT REALITY IS NOT EXTERNAL
REALITY EXISTS IN THE HUMAN MIND AND NOWHERE ELSE NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL
MIND WHICH CAN MAKE MISTAKES AND IN ANY CASE SOON PERISHES ONLY IN THE
MIND OF THE PARTY WHICH IS COLLECTIVE AND IMMORTAL WHATEVER THE PARTY
HOLDS TO BE THE TRUTH IS TRUTH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE REALITY EXCEPT BY
LOOKING THROUGH THE EYES OF THE PARTY THAT IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE GOT
TO RELEARN WINSTON IT NEEDS AN ACT OF SELFDESTRUCTION AN EFFORT OF THE
WILL YOU MUST HUMBLE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU CAN BECOME SANE

HE PAUSED FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS THOUGH TO ALLOW WHAT HE HAD BEEN SAYING TO
SINK IN

DO YOU REMEMBER HE WENT ON WRITING IN YOUR DIARY FREEDOM IS THE
FREEDOM TO SAY THAT TWO PLUS TWO MAKE FOUR

YES SAID WINSTON

OBRIEN HELD UP HIS LEFT HAND ITS BACK TOWARDS WINSTON WITH THE THUMB
HIDDEN AND THE FOUR FINGERS EXTENDED

HOW MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP WINSTON

FOUR

AND IF THE PARTY SAYS THAT IT IS NOT FOUR BUT FIVETHEN HOW MANY

FOUR

THE WORD ENDED IN A GASP OF PAIN THE NEEDLE OF THE DIAL HAD SHOT UP TO
FIFTYFIVE THE SWEAT HAD SPRUNG OUT ALL OVER WINSTONS BODY THE AIR TORE
INTO HIS LUNGS AND ISSUED AGAIN IN DEEP GROANS WHICH EVEN BY CLENCHING HIS
TEETH HE COULD NOT STOP OBRIEN WATCHED HIM THE FOUR FINGERS STILL
EXTENDED HE DREW BACK THE LEVER THIS TIME THE PAIN WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY
EASED

HOW MANY FINGERS WINSTON

FOUR

THE NEEDLE WENT UP TO SIXTY

HOW MANY FINGERS WINSTON

FOUR FOUR WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY FOUR

THE NEEDLE MUST HAVE RISEN AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT IT THE HEAVY
STERN FACE AND THE FOUR FINGERS FILLED HIS VISION THE FINGERS STOOD UP
BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE PILLARS ENORMOUS BLURRY AND SEEMING TO VIBRATE
BUT UNMISTAKABLY FOUR

HOW MANY FINGERS WINSTON

FOUR STOP IT STOP IT HOW CAN YOU GO ON FOUR FOUR

HOW MANY FINGERS WINSTON

FIVE FIVE FIVE

NO WINSTON THAT IS NO USE YOU ARE LYING YOU STILL THINK THERE ARE
FOUR HOW MANY FINGERS PLEASE

FOUR FIVE FOUR ANYTHING YOU LIKE ONLY STOP IT STOP THE PAIN

ABRUPTLY HE WAS SITTING UP WITH OBRIENS ARM ROUND HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD
PERHAPS LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FOR A FEW SECONDS THE BONDS THAT HAD HELD HIS
BODY DOWN WERE LOOSENED HE FELT VERY COLD HE WAS SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY
HIS TEETH WERE CHATTERING THE TEARS WERE ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS FOR A
MOMENT HE CLUNG TO OBRIEN LIKE A BABY CURIOUSLY COMFORTED BY THE HEAVY
ARM ROUND HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD THE FEELING THAT OBRIEN WAS HIS PROTECTOR
THAT THE PAIN WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME FROM OUTSIDE FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE
AND THAT IT WAS OBRIEN WHO WOULD SAVE HIM FROM IT

YOU ARE A SLOW LEARNER WINSTON SAID OBRIEN GENTLY

HOW CAN I HELP IT HE BLUBBERED HOW CAN I HELP SEEING WHAT IS IN FRONT
OF MY EYES TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR

SOMETIMES WINSTON SOMETIMES THEY ARE FIVE SOMETIMES THEY ARE THREE
SOMETIMES THEY ARE ALL OF THEM AT ONCE YOU MUST TRY HARDER IT IS NOT
EASY TO BECOME SANE

HE LAID WINSTON DOWN ON THE BED THE GRIP OF HIS LIMBS TIGHTENED AGAIN
BUT THE PAIN HAD EBBED AWAY AND THE TREMBLING HAD STOPPED LEAVING HIM
MERELY WEAK AND COLD OBRIEN MOTIONED WITH HIS HEAD TO THE MAN IN THE
WHITE COAT WHO HAD STOOD IMMOBILE THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS THE MAN IN
THE WHITE COAT BENT DOWN AND LOOKED CLOSELY INTO WINSTONS EYES FELT HIS
PULSE LAID AN EAR AGAINST HIS CHEST TAPPED HERE AND THERE THEN HE
NODDED TO OBRIEN

AGAIN SAID OBRIEN

THE PAIN FLOWED INTO WINSTONS BODY THE NEEDLE MUST BE AT SEVENTY
SEVENTYFIVE HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES THIS TIME HE KNEW THAT THE FINGERS
WERE STILL THERE AND STILL FOUR ALL THAT MATTERED WAS SOMEHOW TO STAY
ALIVE UNTIL THE SPASM WAS OVER HE HAD CEASED TO NOTICE WHETHER HE WAS
CRYING OUT OR NOT THE PAIN LESSENED AGAIN HE OPENED HIS EYES OBRIEN
HAD DRAWN BACK THE LEVER

HOW MANY FINGERS WINSTON

FOUR I SUPPOSE THERE ARE FOUR I WOULD SEE FIVE IF I COULD I AM TRYING
TO SEE FIVE

WHICH DO YOU WISH TO PERSUADE ME THAT YOU SEE FIVE OR REALLY TO SEE
THEM

REALLY TO SEE THEM

AGAIN SAID OBRIEN

PERHAPS THE NEEDLE WAS EIGHTYNINETY WINSTON COULD NOT INTERMITTENTLY
REMEMBER WHY THE PAIN WAS HAPPENING BEHIND HIS SCREWEDUP EYELIDS A
FOREST OF FINGERS SEEMED TO BE MOVING IN A SORT OF DANCE WEAVING IN AND
OUT DISAPPEARING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER AND REAPPEARING AGAIN HE WAS TRYING
TO COUNT THEM HE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHY HE KNEW ONLY THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNT THEM AND THAT THIS WAS SOMEHOW DUE TO THE MYSTERIOUS
IDENTITY BETWEEN FIVE AND FOUR THE PAIN DIED DOWN AGAIN WHEN HE OPENED
HIS EYES IT WAS TO FIND THAT HE WAS STILL SEEING THE SAME THING
INNUMERABLE FINGERS LIKE MOVING TREES WERE STILL STREAMING PAST IN
EITHER DIRECTION CROSSING AND RECROSSING HE SHUT HIS EYES AGAIN

HOW MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP WINSTON

I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW YOU WILL KILL ME IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN FOUR
FIVE SIXIN ALL HONESTY I DONT KNOW

BETTER SAID OBRIEN

A NEEDLE SLID INTO WINSTONS ARM ALMOST IN THE SAME INSTANT A BLISSFUL
HEALING WARMTH SPREAD ALL THROUGH HIS BODY THE PAIN WAS ALREADY
HALFFORGOTTEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY AT OBRIEN
AT SIGHT OF THE HEAVY LINED FACE SO UGLY AND SO INTELLIGENT HIS HEART
SEEMED TO TURN OVER IF HE COULD HAVE MOVED HE WOULD HAVE STRETCHED OUT
A HAND AND LAID IT ON OBRIENS ARM HE HAD NEVER LOVED HIM SO DEEPLY AS
AT THIS MOMENT AND NOT MERELY BECAUSE HE HAD STOPPED THE PAIN THE OLD
FEELING THAT AT BOTTOM IT DID NOT MATTER WHETHER OBRIEN WAS A FRIEND
OR AN ENEMY HAD COME BACK OBRIEN WAS A PERSON WHO COULD BE TALKED TO
PERHAPS ONE DID NOT WANT TO BE LOVED SO MUCH AS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OBRIEN
HAD TORTURED HIM TO THE EDGE OF LUNACY AND IN A LITTLE WHILE IT WAS
CERTAIN HE WOULD SEND HIM TO HIS DEATH IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN SOME
SENSE THAT WENT DEEPER THAN FRIENDSHIP THEY WERE INTIMATES SOMEWHERE OR
OTHER ALTHOUGH THE ACTUAL WORDS MIGHT NEVER BE SPOKEN THERE WAS A PLACE
WHERE THEY COULD MEET AND TALK OBRIEN WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HIM WITH AN
EXPRESSION WHICH SUGGESTED THAT THE SAME THOUGHT MIGHT BE IN HIS OWN MIND
WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS IN AN EASY CONVERSATIONAL TONE

DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WINSTON HE SAID

I DONT KNOW I CAN GUESS IN THE MINISTRY OF LOVE

DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN HERE

I DONT KNOW DAYS WEEKS MONTHSI THINK IT IS MONTHS

AND WHY DO YOU IMAGINE THAT WE BRING PEOPLE TO THIS PLACE

TO MAKE THEM CONFESS

NO THAT IS NOT THE REASON TRY AGAIN

TO PUNISH THEM

NO EXCLAIMED OBRIEN HIS VOICE HAD CHANGED EXTRAORDINARILY AND HIS
FACE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME BOTH STERN AND ANIMATED NO NOT MERELY TO
EXTRACT YOUR CONFESSION NOT TO PUNISH YOU SHALL I TELL YOU WHY WE HAVE
BROUGHT YOU HERE TO CURE YOU TO MAKE YOU SANE WILL YOU UNDERSTAND
WINSTON THAT NO ONE WHOM WE BRING TO THIS PLACE EVER LEAVES OUR HANDS
UNCURED WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THOSE STUPID CRIMES THAT YOU HAVE
COMMITTED THE PARTY IS NOT INTERESTED IN THE OVERT ACT THE THOUGHT IS
ALL WE CARE ABOUT WE DO NOT MERELY DESTROY OUR ENEMIES WE CHANGE THEM
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT

HE WAS BENDING OVER WINSTON HIS FACE LOOKED ENORMOUS BECAUSE OF ITS
NEARNESS AND HIDEOUSLY UGLY BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN FROM BELOW MOREOVER IT
WAS FILLED WITH A SORT OF EXALTATION A LUNATIC INTENSITY AGAIN WINSTONS
HEART SHRANK IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE HE WOULD HAVE COWERED DEEPER INTO
THE BED HE FELT CERTAIN THAT OBRIEN WAS ABOUT TO TWIST THE DIAL OUT OF
SHEER WANTONNESS AT THIS MOMENT HOWEVER OBRIEN TURNED AWAY HE TOOK A
PACE OR TWO UP AND DOWN THEN HE CONTINUED LESS VEHEMENTLY

THE FIRST THING FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IN THIS PLACE THERE ARE NO
MARTYRDOMS YOU HAVE READ OF THE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTIONS OF THE PAST IN
THE MIDDLE AGES THERE WAS THE INQUISITION IT WAS A FAILURE IT SET OUT
TO ERADICATE HERESY AND ENDED BY PERPETUATING IT FOR EVERY HERETIC IT
BURNED AT THE STAKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS ROSE UP WHY WAS THAT BECAUSE
THE INQUISITION KILLED ITS ENEMIES IN THE OPEN AND KILLED THEM WHILE
THEY WERE STILL UNREPENTANT IN FACT IT KILLED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE
UNREPENTANT MEN WERE DYING BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT ABANDON THEIR TRUE
BELIEFS NATURALLY ALL THE GLORY BELONGED TO THE VICTIM AND ALL THE SHAME
TO THE INQUISITOR WHO BURNED HIM LATER IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THERE
WERE THE TOTALITARIANS AS THEY WERE CALLED THERE WERE THE GERMAN NAZIS
AND THE RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS THE RUSSIANS PERSECUTED HERESY MORE CRUELLY
THAN THE INQUISITION HAD DONE AND THEY IMAGINED THAT THEY HAD LEARNED
FROM THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST THEY KNEW AT ANY RATE THAT ONE MUST NOT
MAKE MARTYRS BEFORE THEY EXPOSED THEIR VICTIMS TO PUBLIC TRIAL THEY
DELIBERATELY SET THEMSELVES TO DESTROY THEIR DIGNITY THEY WORE THEM DOWN
BY TORTURE AND SOLITUDE UNTIL THEY WERE DESPICABLE CRINGING WRETCHES
CONFESSING WHATEVER WAS PUT INTO THEIR MOUTHS COVERING THEMSELVES WITH
ABUSE ACCUSING AND SHELTERING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER WHIMPERING FOR MERCY
AND YET AFTER ONLY A FEW YEARS THE SAME THING HAD HAPPENED OVER AGAIN
THE DEAD MEN HAD BECOME MARTYRS AND THEIR DEGRADATION WAS FORGOTTEN ONCE
AGAIN WHY WAS IT IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THE CONFESSIONS THAT THEY
HAD MADE WERE OBVIOUSLY EXTORTED AND UNTRUE WE DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES OF
THAT KIND ALL THE CONFESSIONS THAT ARE UTTERED HERE ARE TRUE WE MAKE
THEM TRUE AND ABOVE ALL WE DO NOT ALLOW THE DEAD TO RISE UP AGAINST US
YOU MUST STOP IMAGINING THAT POSTERITY WILL VINDICATE YOU WINSTON
POSTERITY WILL NEVER HEAR OF YOU YOU WILL BE LIFTED CLEAN OUT FROM THE
STREAM OF HISTORY WE SHALL TURN YOU INTO GAS AND POUR YOU INTO THE
STRATOSPHERE NOTHING WILL REMAIN OF YOU NOT A NAME IN A REGISTER NOT
A MEMORY IN A LIVING BRAIN YOU WILL BE ANNIHILATED IN THE PAST AS WELL
AS IN THE FUTURE YOU WILL NEVER HAVE EXISTED

THEN WHY BOTHER TO TORTURE ME THOUGHT WINSTON WITH A MOMENTARY
BITTERNESS OBRIEN CHECKED HIS STEP AS THOUGH WINSTON HAD UTTERED THE
THOUGHT ALOUD HIS LARGE UGLY FACE CAME NEARER WITH THE EYES A LITTLE
NARROWED

YOU ARE THINKING HE SAID THAT SINCE WE INTEND TO DESTROY YOU UTTERLY
SO THAT NOTHING THAT YOU SAY OR DO CAN MAKE THE SMALLEST DIFFERENCEIN
THAT CASE WHY DO WE GO TO THE TROUBLE OF INTERROGATING YOU FIRST THAT IS
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING WAS IT NOT

YES SAID WINSTON

OBRIEN SMILED SLIGHTLY YOU ARE A FLAW IN THE PATTERN WINSTON YOU ARE
A STAIN THAT MUST BE WIPED OUT DID I NOT TELL YOU JUST NOW THAT WE ARE
DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSECUTORS OF THE PAST WE ARE NOT CONTENT WITH
NEGATIVE OBEDIENCE NOR EVEN WITH THE MOST ABJECT SUBMISSION WHEN FINALLY
YOU SURRENDER TO US IT MUST BE OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL WE DO NOT DESTROY
THE HERETIC BECAUSE HE RESISTS US SO LONG AS HE RESISTS US WE NEVER
DESTROY HIM WE CONVERT HIM WE CAPTURE HIS INNER MIND WE RESHAPE HIM
WE BURN ALL EVIL AND ALL ILLUSION OUT OF HIM WE BRING HIM OVER TO OUR
SIDE NOT IN APPEARANCE BUT GENUINELY HEART AND SOUL WE MAKE HIM ONE OF
OURSELVES BEFORE WE KILL HIM IT IS INTOLERABLE TO US THAT AN ERRONEOUS
THOUGHT SHOULD EXIST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD HOWEVER SECRET AND POWERLESS
IT MAY BE EVEN IN THE INSTANT OF DEATH WE CANNOT PERMIT ANY DEVIATION IN
THE OLD DAYS THE HERETIC WALKED TO THE STAKE STILL A HERETIC PROCLAIMING
HIS HERESY EXULTING IN IT EVEN THE VICTIM OF THE RUSSIAN PURGES COULD
CARRY REBELLION LOCKED UP IN HIS SKULL AS HE WALKED DOWN THE PASSAGE
WAITING FOR THE BULLET BUT WE MAKE THE BRAIN PERFECT BEFORE WE BLOW IT
OUT THE COMMAND OF THE OLD DESPOTISMS WAS THOU SHALT NOT THE COMMAND
OF THE TOTALITARIANS WAS THOU SHALT OUR COMMAND IS THOU ART NO ONE
WHOM WE BRING TO THIS PLACE EVER STANDS OUT AGAINST US EVERYONE IS WASHED
CLEAN EVEN THOSE THREE MISERABLE TRAITORS IN WHOSE INNOCENCE YOU ONCE
BELIEVEDJONES AARONSON AND RUTHERFORDIN THE END WE BROKE THEM DOWN
I TOOK PART IN THEIR INTERROGATION MYSELF I SAW THEM GRADUALLY WORN DOWN
WHIMPERING GROVELLING WEEPINGAND IN THE END IT WAS NOT WITH PAIN OR
FEAR ONLY WITH PENITENCE BY THE TIME WE HAD FINISHED WITH THEM THEY WERE
ONLY THE SHELLS OF MEN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT IN THEM EXCEPT SORROW FOR
WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND LOVE OF BIG BROTHER IT WAS TOUCHING TO SEE
HOW THEY LOVED HIM THEY BEGGED TO BE SHOT QUICKLY SO THAT THEY COULD DIE
WHILE THEIR MINDS WERE STILL CLEAN

HIS VOICE HAD GROWN ALMOST DREAMY THE EXALTATION THE LUNATIC ENTHUSIASM
WAS STILL IN HIS FACE HE IS NOT PRETENDING THOUGHT WINSTON HE IS NOT A
HYPOCRITE HE BELIEVES EVERY WORD HE SAYS WHAT MOST OPPRESSED HIM WAS THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN INTELLECTUAL INFERIORITY HE WATCHED THE HEAVY
YET GRACEFUL FORM STROLLING TO AND FRO IN AND OUT OF THE RANGE OF HIS
VISION OBRIEN WAS A BEING IN ALL WAYS LARGER THAN HIMSELF THERE WAS NO
IDEA THAT HE HAD EVER HAD OR COULD HAVE THAT OBRIEN HAD NOT LONG AGO
KNOWN EXAMINED AND REJECTED HIS MIND CONTAINED WINSTONS MIND BUT
IN THAT CASE HOW COULD IT BE TRUE THAT OBRIEN WAS MAD IT MUST BE HE
WINSTON WHO WAS MAD OBRIEN HALTED AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIM HIS VOICE HAD
GROWN STERN AGAIN

DO NOT IMAGINE THAT YOU WILL SAVE YOURSELF WINSTON HOWEVER COMPLETELY
YOU SURRENDER TO US NO ONE WHO HAS ONCE GONE ASTRAY IS EVER SPARED AND
EVEN IF WE CHOSE TO LET YOU LIVE OUT THE NATURAL TERM OF YOUR LIFE STILL
YOU WOULD NEVER ESCAPE FROM US WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU HERE IS FOR EVER
UNDERSTAND THAT IN ADVANCE WE SHALL CRUSH YOU DOWN TO THE POINT FROM
WHICH THERE IS NO COMING BACK THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU FROM WHICH YOU
COULD NOT RECOVER IF YOU LIVED A THOUSAND YEARS NEVER AGAIN WILL YOU BE
CAPABLE OF ORDINARY HUMAN FEELING EVERYTHING WILL BE DEAD INSIDE YOU
NEVER AGAIN WILL YOU BE CAPABLE OF LOVE OR FRIENDSHIP OR JOY OF LIVING
OR LAUGHTER OR CURIOSITY OR COURAGE OR INTEGRITY YOU WILL BE HOLLOW
WE SHALL SQUEEZE YOU EMPTY AND THEN WE SHALL FILL YOU WITH OURSELVES

HE PAUSED AND SIGNED TO THE MAN IN THE WHITE COAT WINSTON WAS AWARE OF
SOME HEAVY PIECE OF APPARATUS BEING PUSHED INTO PLACE BEHIND HIS HEAD
OBRIEN HAD SAT DOWN BESIDE THE BED SO THAT HIS FACE WAS ALMOST ON A
LEVEL WITH WINSTONS

THREE THOUSAND HE SAID SPEAKING OVER WINSTONS HEAD TO THE MAN IN THE
WHITE COAT

TWO SOFT PADS WHICH FELT SLIGHTLY MOIST CLAMPED THEMSELVES AGAINST
WINSTONS TEMPLES HE QUAILED THERE WAS PAIN COMING A NEW KIND OF PAIN
OBRIEN LAID A HAND REASSURINGLY ALMOST KINDLY ON HIS

THIS TIME IT WILL NOT HURT HE SAID KEEP YOUR EYES FIXED ON MINE

AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION OR WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN
EXPLOSION THOUGH IT WAS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER THERE WAS ANY NOISE THERE
WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT WINSTON WAS NOT HURT ONLY
PROSTRATED ALTHOUGH HE HAD ALREADY BEEN LYING ON HIS BACK WHEN THE THING
HAPPENED HE HAD A CURIOUS FEELING THAT HE HAD BEEN KNOCKED INTO THAT
POSITION A TERRIFIC PAINLESS BLOW HAD FLATTENED HIM OUT ALSO SOMETHING
HAD HAPPENED INSIDE HIS HEAD AS HIS EYES REGAINED THEIR FOCUS HE
REMEMBERED WHO HE WAS AND WHERE HE WAS AND RECOGNIZED THE FACE THAT WAS
GAZING INTO HIS OWN BUT SOMEWHERE OR OTHER THERE WAS A LARGE PATCH OF
EMPTINESS AS THOUGH A PIECE HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS BRAIN

IT WILL NOT LAST SAID OBRIEN LOOK ME IN THE EYES WHAT COUNTRY IS
OCEANIA AT WAR WITH

WINSTON THOUGHT HE KNEW WHAT WAS MEANT BY OCEANIA AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS
A CITIZEN OF OCEANIA HE ALSO REMEMBERED EURASIA AND EASTASIA BUT WHO WAS
AT WAR WITH WHOM HE DID NOT KNOW IN FACT HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE THAT THERE
WAS ANY WAR

I DONT REMEMBER

OCEANIA IS AT WAR WITH EASTASIA DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NOW

YES

OCEANIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH EASTASIA SINCE THE BEGINNING OF YOUR
LIFE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PARTY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HISTORY
THE WAR HAS CONTINUED WITHOUT A BREAK ALWAYS THE SAME WAR DO YOU
REMEMBER THAT

YES

ELEVEN YEARS AGO YOU CREATED A LEGEND ABOUT THREE MEN WHO HAD BEEN
CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR TREACHERY YOU PRETENDED THAT YOU HAD SEEN A PIECE
OF PAPER WHICH PROVED THEM INNOCENT NO SUCH PIECE OF PAPER EVER EXISTED
YOU INVENTED IT AND LATER YOU GREW TO BELIEVE IN IT YOU REMEMBER NOW THE
VERY MOMENT AT WHICH YOU FIRST INVENTED IT DO YOU REMEMBER THAT

YES

JUST NOW I HELD UP THE FINGERS OF MY HAND TO YOU YOU SAW FIVE FINGERS
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT

YES

OBRIEN HELD UP THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND WITH THE THUMB CONCEALED

THERE ARE FIVE FINGERS THERE DO YOU SEE FIVE FINGERS

YES

AND HE DID SEE THEM FOR A FLEETING INSTANT BEFORE THE SCENERY OF HIS
MIND CHANGED HE SAW FIVE FINGERS AND THERE WAS NO DEFORMITY THEN
EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AGAIN AND THE OLD FEAR THE HATRED AND THE
BEWILDERMENT CAME CROWDING BACK AGAIN BUT THERE HAD BEEN A MOMENTHE DID
NOT KNOW HOW LONG THIRTY SECONDS PERHAPSOF LUMINOUS CERTAINTY WHEN
EACH NEW SUGGESTION OF OBRIENS HAD FILLED UP A PATCH OF EMPTINESS AND
BECOME ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND WHEN TWO AND TWO COULD HAVE BEEN THREE AS
EASILY AS FIVE IF THAT WERE WHAT WAS NEEDED IT HAD FADED BUT BEFORE
OBRIEN HAD DROPPED HIS HAND BUT THOUGH HE COULD NOT RECAPTURE IT HE
COULD REMEMBER IT AS ONE REMEMBERS A VIVID EXPERIENCE AT SOME PERIOD OF
ONES LIFE WHEN ONE WAS IN EFFECT A DIFFERENT PERSON

YOU SEE NOW SAID OBRIEN THAT IT IS AT ANY RATE POSSIBLE

YES SAID WINSTON

OBRIEN STOOD UP WITH A SATISFIED AIR OVER TO HIS LEFT WINSTON SAW THE
MAN IN THE WHITE COAT BREAK AN AMPOULE AND DRAW BACK THE PLUNGER OF A
SYRINGE OBRIEN TURNED TO WINSTON WITH A SMILE IN ALMOST THE OLD MANNER
HE RESETTLED HIS SPECTACLES ON HIS NOSE

DO YOU REMEMBER WRITING IN YOUR DIARY HE SAID THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
WHETHER I WAS A FRIEND OR AN ENEMY SINCE I WAS AT LEAST A PERSON WHO
UNDERSTOOD YOU AND COULD BE TALKED TO YOU WERE RIGHT I ENJOY TALKING TO
YOU YOUR MIND APPEALS TO ME IT RESEMBLES MY OWN MIND EXCEPT THAT YOU
HAPPEN TO BE INSANE BEFORE WE BRING THE SESSION TO AN END YOU CAN ASK ME
A FEW QUESTIONS IF YOU CHOOSE

ANY QUESTION I LIKE

ANYTHING HE SAW THAT WINSTONS EYES WERE UPON THE DIAL IT IS SWITCHED
OFF WHAT IS YOUR FIRST QUESTION

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH JULIA SAID WINSTON

OBRIEN SMILED AGAIN SHE BETRAYED YOU WINSTON IMMEDIATELYUNRESERVEDLY
I HAVE SELDOM SEEN ANYONE COME OVER TO US SO PROMPTLY YOU WOULD HARDLY
RECOGNIZE HER IF YOU SAW HER ALL HER REBELLIOUSNESS HER DECEIT HER
FOLLY HER DIRTYMINDEDNESSEVERYTHING HAS BEEN BURNED OUT OF HER IT WAS
A PERFECT CONVERSION A TEXTBOOK CASE

YOU TORTURED HER

OBRIEN LEFT THIS UNANSWERED NEXT QUESTION HE SAID

DOES BIG BROTHER EXIST

OF COURSE HE EXISTS THE PARTY EXISTS BIG BROTHER IS THE EMBODIMENT OF
THE PARTY

DOES HE EXIST IN THE SAME WAY AS I EXIST

YOU DO NOT EXIST SAID OBRIEN

ONCE AGAIN THE SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS ASSAILED HIM HE KNEW OR HE COULD
IMAGINE THE ARGUMENTS WHICH PROVED HIS OWN NONEXISTENCE BUT THEY WERE
NONSENSE THEY WERE ONLY A PLAY ON WORDS DID NOT THE STATEMENT YOU DO
NOT EXIST CONTAIN A LOGICAL ABSURDITY BUT WHAT USE WAS IT TO SAY SO
HIS MIND SHRIVELLED AS HE THOUGHT OF THE UNANSWERABLE MAD ARGUMENTS WITH
WHICH OBRIEN WOULD DEMOLISH HIM

I THINK I EXIST HE SAID WEARILY I AM CONSCIOUS OF MY OWN IDENTITY
I WAS BORN AND I SHALL DIE I HAVE ARMS AND LEGS I OCCUPY A PARTICULAR
POINT IN SPACE NO OTHER SOLID OBJECT CAN OCCUPY THE SAME POINT
SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THAT SENSE DOES BIG BROTHER EXIST

IT IS OF NO IMPORTANCE HE EXISTS

WILL BIG BROTHER EVER DIE

OF COURSE NOT HOW COULD HE DIE NEXT QUESTION

DOES THE BROTHERHOOD EXIST

THAT WINSTON YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IF WE CHOOSE TO SET YOU FREE WHEN WE
HAVE FINISHED WITH YOU AND IF YOU LIVE TO BE NINETY YEARS OLD STILL YOU
WILL NEVER LEARN WHETHER THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES OR NO AS LONG
AS YOU LIVE IT WILL BE AN UNSOLVED RIDDLE IN YOUR MIND

WINSTON LAY SILENT HIS BREAST ROSE AND FELL A LITTLE FASTER HE STILL HAD
NOT ASKED THE QUESTION THAT HAD COME INTO HIS MIND THE FIRST HE HAD GOT
TO ASK IT AND YET IT WAS AS THOUGH HIS TONGUE WOULD NOT UTTER IT THERE
WAS A TRACE OF AMUSEMENT IN OBRIENS FACE EVEN HIS SPECTACLES SEEMED TO
WEAR AN IRONICAL GLEAM HE KNOWS THOUGHT WINSTON SUDDENLY HE KNOWS WHAT
I AM GOING TO ASK AT THE THOUGHT THE WORDS BURST OUT OF HIM

WHAT IS IN ROOM 101

THE EXPRESSION ON OBRIENS FACE DID NOT CHANGE HE ANSWERED DRILY

YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN ROOM 101 WINSTON EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IS IN
ROOM 101

HE RAISED A FINGER TO THE MAN IN THE WHITE COAT EVIDENTLY THE SESSION WAS
AT AN END A NEEDLE JERKED INTO WINSTONS ARM HE SANK ALMOST INSTANTLY
INTO DEEP SLEEP




CHAPTER 3



THERE ARE THREE STAGES IN YOUR REINTEGRATION SAID OBRIEN THERE IS
LEARNING THERE IS UNDERSTANDING AND THERE IS ACCEPTANCE IT IS TIME FOR
YOU TO ENTER UPON THE SECOND STAGE

AS ALWAYS WINSTON WAS LYING FLAT ON HIS BACK BUT OF LATE HIS BONDS WERE
LOOSER THEY STILL HELD HIM TO THE BED BUT HE COULD MOVE HIS KNEES A
LITTLE AND COULD TURN HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND RAISE HIS ARMS FROM
THE ELBOW THE DIAL ALSO HAD GROWN TO BE LESS OF A TERROR HE COULD
EVADE ITS PANGS IF HE WAS QUICKWITTED ENOUGH IT WAS CHIEFLY WHEN HE
SHOWED STUPIDITY THAT OBRIEN PULLED THE LEVER SOMETIMES THEY GOT THROUGH
A WHOLE SESSION WITHOUT USE OF THE DIAL HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HOW MANY
SESSIONS THERE HAD BEEN THE WHOLE PROCESS SEEMED TO STRETCH OUT OVER A
LONG INDEFINITE TIMEWEEKS POSSIBLYAND THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE
SESSIONS MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE BEEN DAYS SOMETIMES ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO

AS YOU LIE THERE SAID OBRIEN YOU HAVE OFTEN WONDEREDYOU HAVE EVEN
ASKED MEWHY THE MINISTRY OF LOVE SHOULD EXPEND SO MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE
ON YOU AND WHEN YOU WERE FREE YOU WERE PUZZLED BY WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY
THE SAME QUESTION YOU COULD GRASP THE MECHANICS OF THE SOCIETY YOU LIVED
IN BUT NOT ITS UNDERLYING MOTIVES DO YOU REMEMBER WRITING IN YOUR DIARY
I UNDERSTAND HOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS WHEN YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHY THAT YOU DOUBTED YOUR OWN SANITY YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK
GOLDSTEINS BOOK OR PARTS OF IT AT LEAST DID IT TELL YOU ANYTHING THAT
YOU DID NOT KNOW ALREADY

YOU HAVE READ IT SAID WINSTON

I WROTE IT THAT IS TO SAY I COLLABORATED IN WRITING IT NO BOOK IS
PRODUCED INDIVIDUALLY AS YOU KNOW

IS IT TRUE WHAT IT SAYS

AS DESCRIPTION YES THE PROGRAMME IT SETS FORTH IS NONSENSE THE SECRET
ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGEA GRADUAL SPREAD OF ENLIGHTENMENTULTIMATELY
A PROLETARIAN REBELLIONTHE OVERTHROW OF THE PARTY YOU FORESAW YOURSELF
THAT THAT WAS WHAT IT WOULD SAY IT IS ALL NONSENSE THE PROLETARIANS WILL
NEVER REVOLT NOT IN A THOUSAND YEARS OR A MILLION THEY CANNOT I DO
NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU THE REASON YOU KNOW IT ALREADY IF YOU HAVE EVER
CHERISHED ANY DREAMS OF VIOLENT INSURRECTION YOU MUST ABANDON THEM THERE
IS NO WAY IN WHICH THE PARTY CAN BE OVERTHROWN THE RULE OF THE PARTY IS
FOR EVER MAKE THAT THE STARTINGPOINT OF YOUR THOUGHTS

HE CAME CLOSER TO THE BED FOR EVER HE REPEATED AND NOW LET US GET
BACK TO THE QUESTION OF HOW AND WHY YOU UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH HOW
THE PARTY MAINTAINS ITSELF IN POWER NOW TELL ME WHY WE CLING TO POWER
WHAT IS OUR MOTIVE WHY SHOULD WE WANT POWER GO ON SPEAK HE ADDED AS
WINSTON REMAINED SILENT

NEVERTHELESS WINSTON DID NOT SPEAK FOR ANOTHER MOMENT OR TWO A FEELING OF
WEARINESS HAD OVERWHELMED HIM THE FAINT MAD GLEAM OF ENTHUSIASM HAD COME
BACK INTO OBRIENS FACE HE KNEW IN ADVANCE WHAT OBRIEN WOULD SAY THAT
THE PARTY DID NOT SEEK POWER FOR ITS OWN ENDS BUT ONLY FOR THE GOOD OF
THE MAJORITY THAT IT SOUGHT POWER BECAUSE MEN IN THE MASS WERE FRAIL
COWARDLY CREATURES WHO COULD NOT ENDURE LIBERTY OR FACE THE TRUTH AND
MUST BE RULED OVER AND SYSTEMATICALLY DECEIVED BY OTHERS WHO WERE STRONGER
THAN THEMSELVES THAT THE CHOICE FOR MANKIND LAY BETWEEN FREEDOM AND
HAPPINESS AND THAT FOR THE GREAT BULK OF MANKIND HAPPINESS WAS BETTER
THAT THE PARTY WAS THE ETERNAL GUARDIAN OF THE WEAK A DEDICATED SECT
DOING EVIL THAT GOOD MIGHT COME SACRIFICING ITS OWN HAPPINESS TO THAT OF
OTHERS THE TERRIBLE THING THOUGHT WINSTON THE TERRIBLE THING WAS THAT
WHEN OBRIEN SAID THIS HE WOULD BELIEVE IT YOU COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE
OBRIEN KNEW EVERYTHING A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN WINSTON HE KNEW WHAT
THE WORLD WAS REALLY LIKE IN WHAT DEGRADATION THE MASS OF HUMAN BEINGS
LIVED AND BY WHAT LIES AND BARBARITIES THE PARTY KEPT THEM THERE HE HAD
UNDERSTOOD IT ALL WEIGHED IT ALL AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE ALL WAS
JUSTIFIED BY THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE WHAT CAN YOU DO THOUGHT WINSTON
AGAINST THE LUNATIC WHO IS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOURSELF WHO GIVES YOUR
ARGUMENTS A FAIR HEARING AND THEN SIMPLY PERSISTS IN HIS LUNACY

YOU ARE RULING OVER US FOR OUR OWN GOOD HE SAID FEEBLY YOU BELIEVE
THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT FIT TO GOVERN THEMSELVES AND THEREFORE

HE STARTED AND ALMOST CRIED OUT A PANG OF PAIN HAD SHOT THROUGH HIS BODY
OBRIEN HAD PUSHED THE LEVER OF THE DIAL UP TO THIRTYFIVE

THAT WAS STUPID WINSTON STUPID HE SAID YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN
TO SAY A THING LIKE THAT

HE PULLED THE LEVER BACK AND CONTINUED

NOW I WILL TELL YOU THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IT IS THIS THE PARTY
SEEKS POWER ENTIRELY FOR ITS OWN SAKE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE GOOD
OF OTHERS WE ARE INTERESTED SOLELY IN POWER NOT WEALTH OR LUXURY OR LONG
LIFE OR HAPPINESS ONLY POWER PURE POWER WHAT PURE POWER MEANS YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND PRESENTLY WE ARE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OLIGARCHIES OF THE
PAST IN THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING ALL THE OTHERS EVEN THOSE WHO
RESEMBLED OURSELVES WERE COWARDS AND HYPOCRITES THE GERMAN NAZIS AND THE
RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS CAME VERY CLOSE TO US IN THEIR METHODS BUT THEY NEVER
HAD THE COURAGE TO RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN MOTIVES THEY PRETENDED PERHAPS
THEY EVEN BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD SEIZED POWER UNWILLINGLY AND FOR A
LIMITED TIME AND THAT JUST ROUND THE CORNER THERE LAY A PARADISE WHERE
HUMAN BEINGS WOULD BE FREE AND EQUAL WE ARE NOT LIKE THAT WE KNOW THAT
NO ONE EVER SEIZES POWER WITH THE INTENTION OF RELINQUISHING IT POWER IS
NOT A MEANS IT IS AN END ONE DOES NOT ESTABLISH A DICTATORSHIP IN ORDER
TO SAFEGUARD A REVOLUTION ONE MAKES THE REVOLUTION IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH
THE DICTATORSHIP THE OBJECT OF PERSECUTION IS PERSECUTION THE OBJECT OF
TORTURE IS TORTURE THE OBJECT OF POWER IS POWER NOW DO YOU BEGIN TO
UNDERSTAND ME

WINSTON WAS STRUCK AS HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BEFORE BY THE TIREDNESS OF
OBRIENS FACE IT WAS STRONG AND FLESHY AND BRUTAL IT WAS FULL OF
INTELLIGENCE AND A SORT OF CONTROLLED PASSION BEFORE WHICH HE FELT HIMSELF
HELPLESS BUT IT WAS TIRED THERE WERE POUCHES UNDER THE EYES THE SKIN
SAGGED FROM THE CHEEKBONES OBRIEN LEANED OVER HIM DELIBERATELY BRINGING
THE WORN FACE NEARER

YOU ARE THINKING HE SAID THAT MY FACE IS OLD AND TIRED YOU ARE
THINKING THAT I TALK OF POWER AND YET I AM NOT EVEN ABLE TO PREVENT THE
DECAY OF MY OWN BODY CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WINSTON THAT THE INDIVIDUAL
IS ONLY A CELL THE WEARINESS OF THE CELL IS THE VIGOUR OF THE ORGANISM
DO YOU DIE WHEN YOU CUT YOUR FINGERNAILS

HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE BED AND BEGAN STROLLING UP AND DOWN AGAIN ONE HAND
IN HIS POCKET

WE ARE THE PRIESTS OF POWER HE SAID GOD IS POWER BUT AT PRESENT
POWER IS ONLY A WORD SO FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO
GATHER SOME IDEA OF WHAT POWER MEANS THE FIRST THING YOU MUST REALIZE
IS THAT POWER IS COLLECTIVE THE INDIVIDUAL ONLY HAS POWER IN SO FAR AS
HE CEASES TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW THE PARTY SLOGAN FREEDOM IS
SLAVERY HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT IT IS REVERSIBLE SLAVERY IS
FREEDOM ALONEFREETHE HUMAN BEING IS ALWAYS DEFEATED IT MUST BE SO
BECAUSE EVERY HUMAN BEING IS DOOMED TO DIE WHICH IS THE GREATEST OF ALL
FAILURES BUT IF HE CAN MAKE COMPLETE UTTER SUBMISSION IF HE CAN ESCAPE
FROM HIS IDENTITY IF HE CAN MERGE HIMSELF IN THE PARTY SO THAT HE IS THE
PARTY THEN HE IS ALLPOWERFUL AND IMMORTAL THE SECOND THING FOR YOU TO
REALIZE IS THAT POWER IS POWER OVER HUMAN BEINGS OVER THE BODYBUT ABOVE
ALL OVER THE MIND POWER OVER MATTEREXTERNAL REALITY AS YOU WOULD CALL
ITIS NOT IMPORTANT ALREADY OUR CONTROL OVER MATTER IS ABSOLUTE

FOR A MOMENT WINSTON IGNORED THE DIAL HE MADE A VIOLENT EFFORT TO RAISE
HIMSELF INTO A SITTING POSITION AND MERELY SUCCEEDED IN WRENCHING HIS
BODY PAINFULLY

BUT HOW CAN YOU CONTROL MATTER HE BURST OUT YOU DONT EVEN CONTROL
THE CLIMATE OR THE LAW OF GRAVITY AND THERE ARE DISEASE PAIN DEATH

OBRIEN SILENCED HIM BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HAND WE CONTROL MATTER BECAUSE
WE CONTROL THE MIND REALITY IS INSIDE THE SKULL YOU WILL LEARN BY
DEGREES WINSTON THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE COULD NOT DO INVISIBILITY
LEVITATIONANYTHING I COULD FLOAT OFF THIS FLOOR LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE IF
I WISH TO I DO NOT WISH TO BECAUSE THE PARTY DOES NOT WISH IT YOU MUST
GET RID OF THOSE NINETEENTHCENTURY IDEAS ABOUT THE LAWS OF NATURE WE
MAKE THE LAWS OF NATURE

BUT YOU DO NOT YOU ARE NOT EVEN MASTERS OF THIS PLANET WHAT ABOUT
EURASIA AND EASTASIA YOU HAVE NOT CONQUERED THEM YET

UNIMPORTANT WE SHALL CONQUER THEM WHEN IT SUITS US AND IF WE DID NOT
WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE WE CAN SHUT THEM OUT OF EXISTENCE OCEANIA
IS THE WORLD

BUT THE WORLD ITSELF IS ONLY A SPECK OF DUST AND MAN IS TINYHELPLESS
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS THE EARTH WAS
UNINHABITED

NONSENSE THE EARTH IS AS OLD AS WE ARE NO OLDER HOW COULD IT BE OLDER
NOTHING EXISTS EXCEPT THROUGH HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS

BUT THE ROCKS ARE FULL OF THE BONES OF EXTINCT ANIMALSMAMMOTHS AND
MASTODONS AND ENORMOUS REPTILES WHICH LIVED HERE LONG BEFORE MAN WAS EVER
HEARD OF

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THOSE BONES WINSTON OF COURSE NOT NINETEENTHCENTURY
BIOLOGISTS INVENTED THEM BEFORE MAN THERE WAS NOTHING AFTER MAN IF HE
COULD COME TO AN END THERE WOULD BE NOTHING OUTSIDE MAN THERE IS
NOTHING

BUT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS OUTSIDE US LOOK AT THE STARS SOME OF THEM ARE
A MILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY THEY ARE OUT OF OUR REACH FOR EVER

WHAT ARE THE STARS SAID OBRIEN INDIFFERENTLY THEY ARE BITS OF FIRE
A FEW KILOMETRES AWAY WE COULD REACH THEM IF WE WANTED TO OR WE COULD
BLOT THEM OUT THE EARTH IS THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE THE SUN AND THE
STARS GO ROUND IT

WINSTON MADE ANOTHER CONVULSIVE MOVEMENT THIS TIME HE DID NOT SAY
ANYTHING OBRIEN CONTINUED AS THOUGH ANSWERING A SPOKEN OBJECTION

FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES OF COURSE THAT IS NOT TRUE WHEN WE NAVIGATE THE
OCEAN OR WHEN WE PREDICT AN ECLIPSE WE OFTEN FIND IT CONVENIENT TO
ASSUME THAT THE EARTH GOES ROUND THE SUN AND THAT THE STARS ARE MILLIONS
UPON MILLIONS OF KILOMETRES AWAY BUT WHAT OF IT DO YOU SUPPOSE IT IS
BEYOND US TO PRODUCE A DUAL SYSTEM OF ASTRONOMY THE STARS CAN BE NEAR
OR DISTANT ACCORDING AS WE NEED THEM DO YOU SUPPOSE OUR MATHEMATICIANS
ARE UNEQUAL TO THAT HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN DOUBLETHINK

WINSTON SHRANK BACK UPON THE BED WHATEVER HE SAID THE SWIFT ANSWER
CRUSHED HIM LIKE A BLUDGEON AND YET HE KNEW HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN THE
RIGHT THE BELIEF THAT NOTHING EXISTS OUTSIDE YOUR OWN MINDSURELY THERE
MUST BE SOME WAY OF DEMONSTRATING THAT IT WAS FALSE HAD IT NOT BEEN
EXPOSED LONG AGO AS A FALLACY THERE WAS EVEN A NAME FOR IT WHICH HE
HAD FORGOTTEN A FAINT SMILE TWITCHED THE CORNERS OF OBRIENS MOUTH AS
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM

I TOLD YOU WINSTON HE SAID THAT METAPHYSICS IS NOT YOUR STRONG
POINT THE WORD YOU ARE TRYING TO THINK OF IS SOLIPSISM BUT YOU ARE
MISTAKEN THIS IS NOT SOLIPSISM COLLECTIVE SOLIPSISM IF YOU LIKE BUT
THAT IS A DIFFERENT THING IN FACT THE OPPOSITE THING ALL THIS IS A
DIGRESSION HE ADDED IN A DIFFERENT TONE THE REAL POWER THE POWER WE
HAVE TO FIGHT FOR NIGHT AND DAY IS NOT POWER OVER THINGS BUT OVER MEN
HE PAUSED AND FOR A MOMENT ASSUMED AGAIN HIS AIR OF A SCHOOLMASTER
QUESTIONING A PROMISING PUPIL HOW DOES ONE MAN ASSERT HIS POWER OVER
ANOTHER WINSTON

WINSTON THOUGHT BY MAKING HIM SUFFER HE SAID

EXACTLY BY MAKING HIM SUFFER OBEDIENCE IS NOT ENOUGH UNLESS HE IS
SUFFERING HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT HE IS OBEYING YOUR WILL AND NOT HIS
OWN POWER IS IN INFLICTING PAIN AND HUMILIATION POWER IS IN TEARING
HUMAN MINDS TO PIECES AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER AGAIN IN NEW SHAPES OF
YOUR OWN CHOOSING DO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THEN WHAT KIND OF WORLD WE ARE
CREATING IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE STUPID HEDONISTIC UTOPIAS THAT
THE OLD REFORMERS IMAGINED A WORLD OF FEAR AND TREACHERY AND TORMENT A
WORLD OF TRAMPLING AND BEING TRAMPLED UPON A WORLD WHICH WILL GROW NOT
LESS BUT MORE MERCILESS AS IT REFINES ITSELF PROGRESS IN OUR WORLD WILL
BE PROGRESS TOWARDS MORE PAIN THE OLD CIVILIZATIONS CLAIMED THAT THEY
WERE FOUNDED ON LOVE OR JUSTICE OURS IS FOUNDED UPON HATRED IN OUR WORLD
THERE WILL BE NO EMOTIONS EXCEPT FEAR RAGE TRIUMPH AND SELFABASEMENT
EVERYTHING ELSE WE SHALL DESTROYEVERYTHING ALREADY WE ARE BREAKING DOWN
THE HABITS OF THOUGHT WHICH HAVE SURVIVED FROM BEFORE THE REVOLUTION WE
HAVE CUT THE LINKS BETWEEN CHILD AND PARENT AND BETWEEN MAN AND MAN AND
BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN NO ONE DARES TRUST A WIFE OR A CHILD OR A FRIEND
ANY LONGER BUT IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL BE NO WIVES AND NO FRIENDS
CHILDREN WILL BE TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHERS AT BIRTH AS ONE TAKES EGGS FROM
A HEN THE SEX INSTINCT WILL BE ERADICATED PROCREATION WILL BE AN ANNUAL
FORMALITY LIKE THE RENEWAL OF A RATION CARD WE SHALL ABOLISH THE ORGASM
OUR NEUROLOGISTS ARE AT WORK UPON IT NOW THERE WILL BE NO LOYALTY EXCEPT
LOYALTY TOWARDS THE PARTY THERE WILL BE NO LOVE EXCEPT THE LOVE OF
BIG BROTHER THERE WILL BE NO LAUGHTER EXCEPT THE LAUGH OF TRIUMPH OVER
A DEFEATED ENEMY THERE WILL BE NO ART NO LITERATURE NO SCIENCE WHEN
WE ARE OMNIPOTENT WE SHALL HAVE NO MORE NEED OF SCIENCE THERE WILL BE
NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN BEAUTY AND UGLINESS THERE WILL BE NO CURIOSITY
NO ENJOYMENT OF THE PROCESS OF LIFE ALL COMPETING PLEASURES WILL BE
DESTROYED BUT ALWAYSDO NOT FORGET THIS WINSTONALWAYS THERE WILL BE
THE INTOXICATION OF POWER CONSTANTLY INCREASING AND CONSTANTLY GROWING
SUBTLER ALWAYS AT EVERY MOMENT THERE WILL BE THE THRILL OF VICTORY
THE SENSATION OF TRAMPLING ON AN ENEMY WHO IS HELPLESS IF YOU WANT A
PICTURE OF THE FUTURE IMAGINE A BOOT STAMPING ON A HUMAN FACEFOR EVER

HE PAUSED AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED WINSTON TO SPEAK WINSTON HAD TRIED TO
SHRINK BACK INTO THE SURFACE OF THE BED AGAIN HE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING
HIS HEART SEEMED TO BE FROZEN OBRIEN WENT ON

AND REMEMBER THAT IT IS FOR EVER THE FACE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE TO BE
STAMPED UPON THE HERETIC THE ENEMY OF SOCIETY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE SO
THAT HE CAN BE DEFEATED AND HUMILIATED OVER AGAIN EVERYTHING THAT YOU
HAVE UNDERGONE SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN OUR HANDSALL THAT WILL CONTINUE
AND WORSE THE ESPIONAGE THE BETRAYALS THE ARRESTS THE TORTURES THE
EXECUTIONS THE DISAPPEARANCES WILL NEVER CEASE IT WILL BE A WORLD OF
TERROR AS MUCH AS A WORLD OF TRIUMPH THE MORE THE PARTY IS POWERFUL THE
LESS IT WILL BE TOLERANT THE WEAKER THE OPPOSITION THE TIGHTER THE
DESPOTISM GOLDSTEIN AND HIS HERESIES WILL LIVE FOR EVER EVERY DAY AT
EVERY MOMENT THEY WILL BE DEFEATED DISCREDITED RIDICULED SPAT UPON AND
YET THEY WILL ALWAYS SURVIVE THIS DRAMA THAT I HAVE PLAYED OUT WITH YOU
DURING SEVEN YEARS WILL BE PLAYED OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN GENERATION AFTER
GENERATION ALWAYS IN SUBTLER FORMS ALWAYS WE SHALL HAVE THE HERETIC HERE
AT OUR MERCY SCREAMING WITH PAIN BROKEN UP CONTEMPTIBLEAND IN THE END
UTTERLY PENITENT SAVED FROM HIMSELF CRAWLING TO OUR FEET OF HIS OWN
ACCORD THAT IS THE WORLD THAT WE ARE PREPARING WINSTON A WORLD OF
VICTORY AFTER VICTORY TRIUMPH AFTER TRIUMPH AFTER TRIUMPH AN ENDLESS
PRESSING PRESSING PRESSING UPON THE NERVE OF POWER YOU ARE BEGINNING
I CAN SEE TO REALIZE WHAT THAT WORLD WILL BE LIKE BUT IN THE END YOU
WILL DO MORE THAN UNDERSTAND IT YOU WILL ACCEPT IT WELCOME IT BECOME
PART OF IT

WINSTON HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO SPEAK YOU CANT HE SAID
WEAKLY

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT REMARK WINSTON

YOU COULD NOT CREATE SUCH A WORLD AS YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED IT IS A
DREAM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

WHY

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOUND A CIVILIZATION ON FEAR AND HATRED AND CRUELTY
IT WOULD NEVER ENDURE

WHY NOT

IT WOULD HAVE NO VITALITY IT WOULD DISINTEGRATE IT WOULD COMMIT
SUICIDE

NONSENSE YOU ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HATRED IS MORE EXHAUSTING
THAN LOVE WHY SHOULD IT BE AND IF IT WERE WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD THAT
MAKE SUPPOSE THAT WE CHOOSE TO WEAR OURSELVES OUT FASTER SUPPOSE THAT WE
QUICKEN THE TEMPO OF HUMAN LIFE TILL MEN ARE SENILE AT THIRTY STILL WHAT
DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEATH OF THE
INDIVIDUAL IS NOT DEATH THE PARTY IS IMMORTAL

AS USUAL THE VOICE HAD BATTERED WINSTON INTO HELPLESSNESS MOREOVER HE
WAS IN DREAD THAT IF HE PERSISTED IN HIS DISAGREEMENT OBRIEN WOULD TWIST
THE DIAL AGAIN AND YET HE COULD NOT KEEP SILENT FEEBLY WITHOUT
ARGUMENTS WITH NOTHING TO SUPPORT HIM EXCEPT HIS INARTICULATE HORROR OF
WHAT OBRIEN HAD SAID HE RETURNED TO THE ATTACK

I DONT KNOWI DONT CARE SOMEHOW YOU WILL FAIL SOMETHING WILL DEFEAT
YOU LIFE WILL DEFEAT YOU

WE CONTROL LIFE WINSTON AT ALL ITS LEVELS YOU ARE IMAGINING THAT THERE
IS SOMETHING CALLED HUMAN NATURE WHICH WILL BE OUTRAGED BY WHAT WE DO AND
WILL TURN AGAINST US BUT WE CREATE HUMAN NATURE MEN ARE INFINITELY
MALLEABLE OR PERHAPS YOU HAVE RETURNED TO YOUR OLD IDEA THAT THE
PROLETARIANS OR THE SLAVES WILL ARISE AND OVERTHROW US PUT IT OUT OF YOUR
MIND THEY ARE HELPLESS LIKE THE ANIMALS HUMANITY IS THE PARTY THE
OTHERS ARE OUTSIDEIRRELEVANT

I DONT CARE IN THE END THEY WILL BEAT YOU SOONER OR LATER THEY WILL
SEE YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE AND THEN THEY WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES

DO YOU SEE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS HAPPENING OR ANY REASON WHY IT
SHOULD

NO I BELIEVE IT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL FAIL THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE
UNIVERSEI DONT KNOW SOME SPIRIT SOME PRINCIPLETHAT YOU WILL NEVER
OVERCOME

DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD WINSTON

NO

THEN WHAT IS IT THIS PRINCIPLE THAT WILL DEFEAT US

I DONT KNOW THE SPIRIT OF MAN

AND DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A MAN

YES

IF YOU ARE A MAN WINSTON YOU ARE THE LAST MAN YOUR KIND IS EXTINCT WE
ARE THE INHERITORS DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE ALONE YOU ARE OUTSIDE
HISTORY YOU ARE NONEXISTENT HIS MANNER CHANGED AND HE SAID MORE
HARSHLY AND YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF MORALLY SUPERIOR TO US WITH OUR LIES
AND OUR CRUELTY

YES I CONSIDER MYSELF SUPERIOR

OBRIEN DID NOT SPEAK TWO OTHER VOICES WERE SPEAKING AFTER A MOMENT
WINSTON RECOGNIZED ONE OF THEM AS HIS OWN IT WAS A SOUNDTRACK OF THE
CONVERSATION HE HAD HAD WITH OBRIEN ON THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD ENROLLED
HIMSELF IN THE BROTHERHOOD HE HEARD HIMSELF PROMISING TO LIE TO STEAL
TO FORGE TO MURDER TO ENCOURAGE DRUGTAKING AND PROSTITUTION TO
DISSEMINATE VENEREAL DISEASES TO THROW VITRIOL IN A CHILDS FACE OBRIEN
MADE A SMALL IMPATIENT GESTURE AS THOUGH TO SAY THAT THE DEMONSTRATION
WAS HARDLY WORTH MAKING THEN HE TURNED A SWITCH AND THE VOICES STOPPED

GET UP FROM THAT BED HE SAID

THE BONDS HAD LOOSENED THEMSELVES WINSTON LOWERED HIMSELF TO THE FLOOR
AND STOOD UP UNSTEADILY

YOU ARE THE LAST MAN SAID OBRIEN YOU ARE THE GUARDIAN OF THE HUMAN
SPIRIT YOU SHALL SEE YOURSELF AS YOU ARE TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES

WINSTON UNDID THE BIT OF STRING THAT HELD HIS OVERALLS TOGETHER THE ZIP
FASTENER HAD LONG SINCE BEEN WRENCHED OUT OF THEM HE COULD NOT REMEMBER
WHETHER AT ANY TIME SINCE HIS ARREST HE HAD TAKEN OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES AT
ONE TIME BENEATH THE OVERALLS HIS BODY WAS LOOPED WITH FILTHY YELLOWISH
RAGS JUST RECOGNIZABLE AS THE REMNANTS OF UNDERCLOTHES AS HE SLID
THEM TO THE GROUND HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A THREESIDED MIRROR AT THE FAR
END OF THE ROOM HE APPROACHED IT THEN STOPPED SHORT AN INVOLUNTARY CRY
HAD BROKEN OUT OF HIM

GO ON SAID OBRIEN STAND BETWEEN THE WINGS OF THE MIRROR YOU SHALL
SEE THE SIDE VIEW AS WELL

HE HAD STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS FRIGHTENED A BOWED GREYCOLOURED
SKELETONLIKE THING WAS COMING TOWARDS HIM ITS ACTUAL APPEARANCE WAS
FRIGHTENING AND NOT MERELY THE FACT THAT HE KNEW IT TO BE HIMSELF HE
MOVED CLOSER TO THE GLASS THE CREATURES FACE SEEMED TO BE PROTRUDED
BECAUSE OF ITS BENT CARRIAGE A FORLORN JAILBIRDS FACE WITH A NOBBY
FOREHEAD RUNNING BACK INTO A BALD SCALP A CROOKED NOSE AND
BATTEREDLOOKING CHEEKBONES ABOVE WHICH HIS EYES WERE FIERCE AND WATCHFUL
THE CHEEKS WERE SEAMED THE MOUTH HAD A DRAWNIN LOOK CERTAINLY IT WAS
HIS OWN FACE BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT HAD CHANGED MORE THAN HE HAD
CHANGED INSIDE THE EMOTIONS IT REGISTERED WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THE
ONES HE FELT HE HAD GONE PARTIALLY BALD FOR THE FIRST MOMENT HE HAD
THOUGHT THAT HE HAD GONE GREY AS WELL BUT IT WAS ONLY THE SCALP THAT WAS
GREY EXCEPT FOR HIS HANDS AND A CIRCLE OF HIS FACE HIS BODY WAS GREY ALL
OVER WITH ANCIENT INGRAINED DIRT HERE AND THERE UNDER THE DIRT THERE
WERE THE RED SCARS OF WOUNDS AND NEAR THE ANKLE THE VARICOSE ULCER WAS AN
INFLAMED MASS WITH FLAKES OF SKIN PEELING OFF IT BUT THE TRULY FRIGHTENING
THING WAS THE EMACIATION OF HIS BODY THE BARREL OF THE RIBS WAS AS NARROW
AS THAT OF A SKELETON THE LEGS HAD SHRUNK SO THAT THE KNEES WERE THICKER
THAN THE THIGHS HE SAW NOW WHAT OBRIEN HAD MEANT ABOUT SEEING THE SIDE
VIEW THE CURVATURE OF THE SPINE WAS ASTONISHING THE THIN SHOULDERS WERE
HUNCHED FORWARD SO AS TO MAKE A CAVITY OF THE CHEST THE SCRAGGY NECK
SEEMED TO BE BENDING DOUBLE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE SKULL AT A GUESS HE
WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS THE BODY OF A MAN OF SIXTY SUFFERING FROM
SOME MALIGNANT DISEASE

YOU HAVE THOUGHT SOMETIMES SAID OBRIEN THAT MY FACETHE FACE OF A
MEMBER OF THE INNER PARTYLOOKS OLD AND WORN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR
OWN FACE

HE SEIZED WINSTONS SHOULDER AND SPUN HIM ROUND SO THAT HE WAS FACING HIM

LOOK AT THE CONDITION YOU ARE IN HE SAID LOOK AT THIS FILTHY GRIME
ALL OVER YOUR BODY LOOK AT THE DIRT BETWEEN YOUR TOES LOOK AT THAT
DISGUSTING RUNNING SORE ON YOUR LEG DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU STINK LIKE A
GOAT PROBABLY YOU HAVE CEASED TO NOTICE IT LOOK AT YOUR EMACIATION DO
YOU SEE I CAN MAKE MY THUMB AND FOREFINGER MEET ROUND YOUR BICEP I COULD
SNAP YOUR NECK LIKE A CARROT DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LOST TWENTYFIVE
KILOGRAMS SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN OUR HANDS EVEN YOUR HAIR IS COMING OUT
IN HANDFULS LOOK HE PLUCKED AT WINSTONS HEAD AND BROUGHT AWAY A TUFT
OF HAIR OPEN YOUR MOUTH NINE TEN ELEVEN TEETH LEFT HOW MANY HAD YOU
WHEN YOU CAME TO US AND THE FEW YOU HAVE LEFT ARE DROPPING OUT OF YOUR
HEAD LOOK HERE

HE SEIZED ONE OF WINSTONS REMAINING FRONT TEETH BETWEEN HIS POWERFUL
THUMB AND FOREFINGER A TWINGE OF PAIN SHOT THROUGH WINSTONS JAW OBRIEN
HAD WRENCHED THE LOOSE TOOTH OUT BY THE ROOTS HE TOSSED IT ACROSS THE
CELL

YOU ARE ROTTING AWAY HE SAID YOU ARE FALLING TO PIECES WHAT ARE YOU
A BAG OF FILTH NOW TURN AROUND AND LOOK INTO THAT MIRROR AGAIN DO YOU
SEE THAT THING FACING YOU THAT IS THE LAST MAN IF YOU ARE HUMAN THAT IS
HUMANITY NOW PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON AGAIN

WINSTON BEGAN TO DRESS HIMSELF WITH SLOW STIFF MOVEMENTS UNTIL NOW HE HAD
NOT SEEMED TO NOTICE HOW THIN AND WEAK HE WAS ONLY ONE THOUGHT STIRRED IN
HIS MIND THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE LONGER THAN HE HAD IMAGINED
THEN SUDDENLY AS HE FIXED THE MISERABLE RAGS ROUND HIMSELF A FEELING OF
PITY FOR HIS RUINED BODY OVERCAME HIM BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
HE HAD COLLAPSED ON TO A SMALL STOOL THAT STOOD BESIDE THE BED AND BURST
INTO TEARS HE WAS AWARE OF HIS UGLINESS HIS GRACELESSNESS A BUNDLE OF
BONES IN FILTHY UNDERCLOTHES SITTING WEEPING IN THE HARSH WHITE LIGHT BUT
HE COULD NOT STOP HIMSELF OBRIEN LAID A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER ALMOST
KINDLY

IT WILL NOT LAST FOR EVER HE SAID YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM IT WHENEVER YOU
CHOOSE EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON YOURSELF

YOU DID IT SOBBED WINSTON YOU REDUCED ME TO THIS STATE

NO WINSTON YOU REDUCED YOURSELF TO IT THIS IS WHAT YOU ACCEPTED WHEN
YOU SET YOURSELF UP AGAINST THE PARTY IT WAS ALL CONTAINED IN THAT FIRST
ACT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED THAT YOU DID NOT FORESEE

HE PAUSED AND THEN WENT ON

WE HAVE BEATEN YOU WINSTON WE HAVE BROKEN YOU UP YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT
YOUR BODY IS LIKE YOUR MIND IS IN THE SAME STATE I DO NOT THINK THERE
CAN BE MUCH PRIDE LEFT IN YOU YOU HAVE BEEN KICKED AND FLOGGED AND
INSULTED YOU HAVE SCREAMED WITH PAIN YOU HAVE ROLLED ON THE FLOOR IN
YOUR OWN BLOOD AND VOMIT YOU HAVE WHIMPERED FOR MERCY YOU HAVE BETRAYED
EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING CAN YOU THINK OF A SINGLE DEGRADATION THAT HAS
NOT HAPPENED TO YOU

WINSTON HAD STOPPED WEEPING THOUGH THE TEARS WERE STILL OOZING OUT OF HIS
EYES HE LOOKED UP AT OBRIEN

I HAVE NOT BETRAYED JULIA HE SAID

OBRIEN LOOKED DOWN AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY NO HE SAID NO THAT IS
PERFECTLY TRUE YOU HAVE NOT BETRAYED JULIA

THE PECULIAR REVERENCE FOR OBRIEN WHICH NOTHING SEEMED ABLE TO DESTROY
FLOODED WINSTONS HEART AGAIN HOW INTELLIGENT HE THOUGHT HOW
INTELLIGENT NEVER DID OBRIEN FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM
ANYONE ELSE ON EARTH WOULD HAVE ANSWERED PROMPTLY THAT HE HAD BETRAYED
JULIA FOR WHAT WAS THERE THAT THEY HAD NOT SCREWED OUT OF HIM UNDER THE
TORTURE HE HAD TOLD THEM EVERYTHING HE KNEW ABOUT HER HER HABITS HER
CHARACTER HER PAST LIFE HE HAD CONFESSED IN THE MOST TRIVIAL DETAIL
EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED AT THEIR MEETINGS ALL THAT HE HAD SAID TO
HER AND SHE TO HIM THEIR BLACKMARKET MEALS THEIR ADULTERIES THEIR
VAGUE PLOTTINGS AGAINST THE PARTYEVERYTHING AND YET IN THE SENSE IN
WHICH HE INTENDED THE WORD HE HAD NOT BETRAYED HER HE HAD NOT STOPPED
LOVING HER HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS HER HAD REMAINED THE SAME OBRIEN HAD
SEEN WHAT HE MEANT WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPLANATION

TELL ME HE SAID HOW SOON WILL THEY SHOOT ME

IT MIGHT BE A LONG TIME SAID OBRIEN YOU ARE A DIFFICULT CASE BUT
DONT GIVE UP HOPE EVERYONE IS CURED SOONER OR LATER IN THE END WE SHALL
SHOOT YOU




CHAPTER 4



HE WAS MUCH BETTER HE WAS GROWING FATTER AND STRONGER EVERY DAY IF IT
WAS PROPER TO SPEAK OF DAYS

THE WHITE LIGHT AND THE HUMMING SOUND WERE THE SAME AS EVER BUT THE CELL
WAS A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THE OTHERS HE HAD BEEN IN THERE WAS A
PILLOW AND A MATTRESS ON THE PLANK BED AND A STOOL TO SIT ON THEY HAD
GIVEN HIM A BATH AND THEY ALLOWED HIM TO WASH HIMSELF FAIRLY FREQUENTLY
IN A TIN BASIN THEY EVEN GAVE HIM WARM WATER TO WASH WITH THEY HAD GIVEN
HIM NEW UNDERCLOTHES AND A CLEAN SUIT OF OVERALLS THEY HAD DRESSED HIS
VARICOSE ULCER WITH SOOTHING OINTMENT THEY HAD PULLED OUT THE REMNANTS
OF HIS TEETH AND GIVEN HIM A NEW SET OF DENTURES

WEEKS OR MONTHS MUST HAVE PASSED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE NOW TO KEEP
COUNT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME IF HE HAD FELT ANY INTEREST IN DOING SO
SINCE HE WAS BEING FED AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE REGULAR INTERVALS HE WAS
GETTING HE JUDGED THREE MEALS IN THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS SOMETIMES HE
WONDERED DIMLY WHETHER HE WAS GETTING THEM BY NIGHT OR BY DAY THE FOOD
WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD WITH MEAT AT EVERY THIRD MEAL ONCE THERE WAS EVEN
A PACKET OF CIGARETTES HE HAD NO MATCHES BUT THE NEVERSPEAKING GUARD
WHO BROUGHT HIS FOOD WOULD GIVE HIM A LIGHT THE FIRST TIME HE TRIED TO
SMOKE IT MADE HIM SICK BUT HE PERSEVERED AND SPUN THE PACKET OUT FOR
A LONG TIME SMOKING HALF A CIGARETTE AFTER EACH MEAL

THEY HAD GIVEN HIM A WHITE SLATE WITH A STUMP OF PENCIL TIED TO THE
CORNER AT FIRST HE MADE NO USE OF IT EVEN WHEN HE WAS AWAKE HE WAS
COMPLETELY TORPID OFTEN HE WOULD LIE FROM ONE MEAL TO THE NEXT ALMOST
WITHOUT STIRRING SOMETIMES ASLEEP SOMETIMES WAKING INTO VAGUE REVERIES
IN WHICH IT WAS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO OPEN HIS EYES HE HAD LONG GROWN
USED TO SLEEPING WITH A STRONG LIGHT ON HIS FACE IT SEEMED TO MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THAT ONES DREAMS WERE MORE COHERENT HE DREAMED A
GREAT DEAL ALL THROUGH THIS TIME AND THEY WERE ALWAYS HAPPY DREAMS HE
WAS IN THE GOLDEN COUNTRY OR HE WAS SITTING AMONG ENORMOUS GLORIOUS
SUNLIT RUINS WITH HIS MOTHER WITH JULIA WITH OBRIENNOT DOING
ANYTHING MERELY SITTING IN THE SUN TALKING OF PEACEFUL THINGS SUCH
THOUGHTS AS HE HAD WHEN HE WAS AWAKE WERE MOSTLY ABOUT HIS DREAMS HE
SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THE POWER OF INTELLECTUAL EFFORT NOW THAT THE
STIMULUS OF PAIN HAD BEEN REMOVED HE WAS NOT BORED HE HAD NO DESIRE
FOR CONVERSATION OR DISTRACTION MERELY TO BE ALONE NOT TO BE BEATEN
OR QUESTIONED TO HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND TO BE CLEAN ALL OVER WAS
COMPLETELY SATISFYING

BY DEGREES HE CAME TO SPEND LESS TIME IN SLEEP BUT HE STILL FELT NO
IMPULSE TO GET OFF THE BED ALL HE CARED FOR WAS TO LIE QUIET AND FEEL THE
STRENGTH GATHERING IN HIS BODY HE WOULD FINGER HIMSELF HERE AND THERE
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT AN ILLUSION THAT HIS MUSCLES WERE
GROWING ROUNDER AND HIS SKIN TAUTER FINALLY IT WAS ESTABLISHED BEYOND A
DOUBT THAT HE WAS GROWING FATTER HIS THIGHS WERE NOW DEFINITELY THICKER
THAN HIS KNEES AFTER THAT RELUCTANTLY AT FIRST HE BEGAN EXERCISING
HIMSELF REGULARLY IN A LITTLE WHILE HE COULD WALK THREE KILOMETRES
MEASURED BY PACING THE CELL AND HIS BOWED SHOULDERS WERE GROWING
STRAIGHTER HE ATTEMPTED MORE ELABORATE EXERCISES AND WAS ASTONISHED AND
HUMILIATED TO FIND WHAT THINGS HE COULD NOT DO HE COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF A
WALK HE COULD NOT HOLD HIS STOOL OUT AT ARMS LENGTH HE COULD NOT STAND
ON ONE LEG WITHOUT FALLING OVER HE SQUATTED DOWN ON HIS HEELS AND FOUND
THAT WITH AGONIZING PAINS IN THIGH AND CALF HE COULD JUST LIFT HIMSELF TO
A STANDING POSITION HE LAY FLAT ON HIS BELLY AND TRIED TO LIFT HIS WEIGHT
BY HIS HANDS IT WAS HOPELESS HE COULD NOT RAISE HIMSELF A CENTIMETRE
BUT AFTER A FEW MORE DAYSA FEW MORE MEALTIMESEVEN THAT FEAT WAS
ACCOMPLISHED A TIME CAME WHEN HE COULD DO IT SIX TIMES RUNNING HE BEGAN
TO GROW ACTUALLY PROUD OF HIS BODY AND TO CHERISH AN INTERMITTENT BELIEF
THAT HIS FACE ALSO WAS GROWING BACK TO NORMAL ONLY WHEN HE CHANCED TO PUT
HIS HAND ON HIS BALD SCALP DID HE REMEMBER THE SEAMED RUINED FACE THAT
HAD LOOKED BACK AT HIM OUT OF THE MIRROR

HIS MIND GREW MORE ACTIVE HE SAT DOWN ON THE PLANK BED HIS BACK AGAINST
THE WALL AND THE SLATE ON HIS KNEES AND SET TO WORK DELIBERATELY AT THE
TASK OF REEDUCATING HIMSELF

HE HAD CAPITULATED THAT WAS AGREED IN REALITY AS HE SAW NOW HE HAD
BEEN READY TO CAPITULATE LONG BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN THE DECISION FROM THE
MOMENT WHEN HE WAS INSIDE THE MINISTRY OF LOVEAND YES EVEN DURING THOSE
MINUTES WHEN HE AND JULIA HAD STOOD HELPLESS WHILE THE IRON VOICE FROM THE
TELESCREEN TOLD THEM WHAT TO DOHE HAD GRASPED THE FRIVOLITY THE
SHALLOWNESS OF HIS ATTEMPT TO SET HIMSELF UP AGAINST THE POWER OF THE
PARTY HE KNEW NOW THAT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE THOUGHT POLICE HAD WATCHED HIM
LIKE A BEETLE UNDER A MAGNIFYING GLASS THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL ACT NO WORD
SPOKEN ALOUD THAT THEY HAD NOT NOTICED NO TRAIN OF THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD
NOT BEEN ABLE TO INFER EVEN THE SPECK OF WHITISH DUST ON THE COVER OF HIS
DIARY THEY HAD CAREFULLY REPLACED THEY HAD PLAYED SOUNDTRACKS TO HIM
SHOWN HIM PHOTOGRAPHS SOME OF THEM WERE PHOTOGRAPHS OF JULIA AND HIMSELF
YES EVEN HE COULD NOT FIGHT AGAINST THE PARTY ANY LONGER BESIDES
THE PARTY WAS IN THE RIGHT IT MUST BE SO HOW COULD THE IMMORTAL
COLLECTIVE BRAIN BE MISTAKEN BY WHAT EXTERNAL STANDARD COULD YOU CHECK
ITS JUDGEMENTS SANITY WAS STATISTICAL IT WAS MERELY A QUESTION OF
LEARNING TO THINK AS THEY THOUGHT ONLY

THE PENCIL FELT THICK AND AWKWARD IN HIS FINGERS HE BEGAN TO WRITE DOWN
THE THOUGHTS THAT CAME INTO HIS HEAD HE WROTE FIRST IN LARGE CLUMSY
CAPITALS


FREEDOM IS SLAVERY


THEN ALMOST WITHOUT A PAUSE HE WROTE BENEATH IT


TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE


BUT THEN THERE CAME A SORT OF CHECK HIS MIND AS THOUGH SHYING AWAY FROM
SOMETHING SEEMED UNABLE TO CONCENTRATE HE KNEW THAT HE KNEW WHAT CAME
NEXT BUT FOR THE MOMENT HE COULD NOT RECALL IT WHEN HE DID RECALL IT
IT WAS ONLY BY CONSCIOUSLY REASONING OUT WHAT IT MUST BE IT DID NOT COME
OF ITS OWN ACCORD HE WROTE


GOD IS POWER


HE ACCEPTED EVERYTHING THE PAST WAS ALTERABLE THE PAST NEVER HAD BEEN
ALTERED OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EASTASIA OCEANIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR
WITH EASTASIA JONES AARONSON AND RUTHERFORD WERE GUILTY OF THE CRIMES
THEY WERE CHARGED WITH HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT DISPROVED
THEIR GUILT IT HAD NEVER EXISTED HE HAD INVENTED IT HE REMEMBERED
REMEMBERING CONTRARY THINGS BUT THOSE WERE FALSE MEMORIES PRODUCTS OF
SELFDECEPTION HOW EASY IT ALL WAS ONLY SURRENDER AND EVERYTHING ELSE
FOLLOWED IT WAS LIKE SWIMMING AGAINST A CURRENT THAT SWEPT YOU BACKWARDS
HOWEVER HARD YOU STRUGGLED AND THEN SUDDENLY DECIDING TO TURN ROUND AND
GO WITH THE CURRENT INSTEAD OF OPPOSING IT NOTHING HAD CHANGED EXCEPT
YOUR OWN ATTITUDE THE PREDESTINED THING HAPPENED IN ANY CASE HE HARDLY
KNEW WHY HE HAD EVER REBELLED EVERYTHING WAS EASY EXCEPT

ANYTHING COULD BE TRUE THE SOCALLED LAWS OF NATURE WERE NONSENSE THE
LAW OF GRAVITY WAS NONSENSE IF I WISHED OBRIEN HAD SAID I COULD
FLOAT OFF THIS FLOOR LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE WINSTON WORKED IT OUT IF HE
THINKS HE FLOATS OFF THE FLOOR AND IF I SIMULTANEOUSLY THINK I SEE HIM
DO IT THEN THE THING HAPPENS SUDDENLY LIKE A LUMP OF SUBMERGED WRECKAGE
BREAKING THE SURFACE OF WATER THE THOUGHT BURST INTO HIS MIND IT DOESNT
REALLY HAPPEN WE IMAGINE IT IT IS HALLUCINATION HE PUSHED THE THOUGHT
UNDER INSTANTLY THE FALLACY WAS OBVIOUS IT PRESUPPOSED THAT SOMEWHERE
OR OTHER OUTSIDE ONESELF THERE WAS A REAL WORLD WHERE REAL THINGS
HAPPENED BUT HOW COULD THERE BE SUCH A WORLD WHAT KNOWLEDGE HAVE WE OF
ANYTHING SAVE THROUGH OUR OWN MINDS ALL HAPPENINGS ARE IN THE MIND
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN ALL MINDS TRULY HAPPENS

HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN DISPOSING OF THE FALLACY AND HE WAS IN NO DANGER
OF SUCCUMBING TO IT HE REALIZED NEVERTHELESS THAT IT OUGHT NEVER TO
HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM THE MIND SHOULD DEVELOP A BLIND SPOT WHENEVER A
DANGEROUS THOUGHT PRESENTED ITSELF THE PROCESS SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC
INSTINCTIVE CRIMESTOP THEY CALLED IT IN NEWSPEAK

HE SET TO WORK TO EXERCISE HIMSELF IN CRIMESTOP HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH
PROPOSITIONSTHE PARTY SAYS THE EARTH IS FLAT THE PARTY SAYS THAT
ICE IS HEAVIER THAN WATERAND TRAINED HIMSELF IN NOT SEEING OR NOT
UNDERSTANDING THE ARGUMENTS THAT CONTRADICTED THEM IT WAS NOT EASY
IT NEEDED GREAT POWERS OF REASONING AND IMPROVISATION THE ARITHMETICAL
PROBLEMS RAISED FOR INSTANCE BY SUCH A STATEMENT AS TWO AND TWO MAKE
FIVE WERE BEYOND HIS INTELLECTUAL GRASP IT NEEDED ALSO A SORT OF
ATHLETICISM OF MIND AN ABILITY AT ONE MOMENT TO MAKE THE MOST DELICATE
USE OF LOGIC AND AT THE NEXT TO BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CRUDEST LOGICAL
ERRORS STUPIDITY WAS AS NECESSARY AS INTELLIGENCE AND AS DIFFICULT TO
ATTAIN

ALL THE WHILE WITH ONE PART OF HIS MIND HE WONDERED HOW SOON THEY WOULD
SHOOT HIM EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON YOURSELF OBRIEN HAD SAID BUT HE KNEW
THAT THERE WAS NO CONSCIOUS ACT BY WHICH HE COULD BRING IT NEARER IT
MIGHT BE TEN MINUTES HENCE OR TEN YEARS THEY MIGHT KEEP HIM FOR YEARS IN
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THEY MIGHT SEND HIM TO A LABOURCAMP THEY MIGHT
RELEASE HIM FOR A WHILE AS THEY SOMETIMES DID IT WAS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE
THAT BEFORE HE WAS SHOT THE WHOLE DRAMA OF HIS ARREST AND INTERROGATION
WOULD BE ENACTED ALL OVER AGAIN THE ONE CERTAIN THING WAS THAT DEATH
NEVER CAME AT AN EXPECTED MOMENT THE TRADITIONTHE UNSPOKEN TRADITION
SOMEHOW YOU KNEW IT THOUGH YOU NEVER HEARD IT SAIDWAS THAT THEY SHOT
YOU FROM BEHIND ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITHOUT WARNING AS YOU
WALKED DOWN A CORRIDOR FROM CELL TO CELL

ONE DAYBUT ONE DAY WAS NOT THE RIGHT EXPRESSION JUST AS PROBABLY IT
WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ONCEHE FELL INTO A STRANGE BLISSFUL
REVERIE HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE CORRIDOR WAITING FOR THE BULLET HE KNEW
THAT IT WAS COMING IN ANOTHER MOMENT EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED SMOOTHED
OUT RECONCILED THERE WERE NO MORE DOUBTS NO MORE ARGUMENTS NO MORE
PAIN NO MORE FEAR HIS BODY WAS HEALTHY AND STRONG HE WALKED EASILY
WITH A JOY OF MOVEMENT AND WITH A FEELING OF WALKING IN SUNLIGHT HE WAS
NOT ANY LONGER IN THE NARROW WHITE CORRIDORS IN THE MINISTRY OF LOVE HE
WAS IN THE ENORMOUS SUNLIT PASSAGE A KILOMETRE WIDE DOWN WHICH HE HAD
SEEMED TO WALK IN THE DELIRIUM INDUCED BY DRUGS HE WAS IN THE GOLDEN
COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FOOTTRACK ACROSS THE OLD RABBITCROPPED PASTURE
HE COULD FEEL THE SHORT SPRINGY TURF UNDER HIS FEET AND THE GENTLE SUNSHINE
ON HIS FACE AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD WERE THE ELM TREES FAINTLY STIRRING
AND SOMEWHERE BEYOND THAT WAS THE STREAM WHERE THE DACE LAY IN THE GREEN
POOLS UNDER THE WILLOWS

SUDDENLY HE STARTED UP WITH A SHOCK OF HORROR THE SWEAT BROKE OUT ON HIS
BACKBONE HE HAD HEARD HIMSELF CRY ALOUD

JULIA JULIA JULIA MY LOVE JULIA

FOR A MOMENT HE HAD HAD AN OVERWHELMING HALLUCINATION OF HER PRESENCE SHE
HAD SEEMED TO BE NOT MERELY WITH HIM BUT INSIDE HIM IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE
HAD GOT INTO THE TEXTURE OF HIS SKIN IN THAT MOMENT HE HAD LOVED HER FAR
MORE THAN HE HAD EVER DONE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER AND FREE ALSO HE KNEW
THAT SOMEWHERE OR OTHER SHE WAS STILL ALIVE AND NEEDED HIS HELP

HE LAY BACK ON THE BED AND TRIED TO COMPOSE HIMSELF WHAT HAD HE DONE HOW
MANY YEARS HAD HE ADDED TO HIS SERVITUDE BY THAT MOMENT OF WEAKNESS

IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE WOULD HEAR THE TRAMP OF BOOTS OUTSIDE THEY COULD NOT
LET SUCH AN OUTBURST GO UNPUNISHED THEY WOULD KNOW NOW IF THEY HAD NOT
KNOWN BEFORE THAT HE WAS BREAKING THE AGREEMENT HE HAD MADE WITH THEM
HE OBEYED THE PARTY BUT HE STILL HATED THE PARTY IN THE OLD DAYS HE HAD
HIDDEN A HERETICAL MIND BENEATH AN APPEARANCE OF CONFORMITY NOW HE HAD
RETREATED A STEP FURTHER IN THE MIND HE HAD SURRENDERED BUT HE HAD HOPED
TO KEEP THE INNER HEART INVIOLATE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN THE WRONG BUT
HE PREFERRED TO BE IN THE WRONG THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THATOBRIEN WOULD
UNDERSTAND IT IT WAS ALL CONFESSED IN THAT SINGLE FOOLISH CRY

HE WOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN IT MIGHT TAKE YEARS HE RAN A HAND
OVER HIS FACE TRYING TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH THE NEW SHAPE THERE
WERE DEEP FURROWS IN THE CHEEKS THE CHEEKBONES FELT SHARP THE NOSE
FLATTENED BESIDES SINCE LAST SEEING HIMSELF IN THE GLASS HE HAD BEEN
GIVEN A COMPLETE NEW SET OF TEETH IT WAS NOT EASY TO PRESERVE
INSCRUTABILITY WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT YOUR FACE LOOKED LIKE IN ANY
CASE MERE CONTROL OF THE FEATURES WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME HE
PERCEIVED THAT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP A SECRET YOU MUST ALSO HIDE IT FROM
YOURSELF YOU MUST KNOW ALL THE WHILE THAT IT IS THERE BUT UNTIL IT IS
NEEDED YOU MUST NEVER LET IT EMERGE INTO YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN ANY SHAPE
THAT COULD BE GIVEN A NAME FROM NOW ONWARDS HE MUST NOT ONLY THINK RIGHT
HE MUST FEEL RIGHT DREAM RIGHT AND ALL THE WHILE HE MUST KEEP HIS HATRED
LOCKED UP INSIDE HIM LIKE A BALL OF MATTER WHICH WAS PART OF HIMSELF AND
YET UNCONNECTED WITH THE REST OF HIM A KIND OF CYST

ONE DAY THEY WOULD DECIDE TO SHOOT HIM YOU COULD NOT TELL WHEN IT WOULD
HAPPEN BUT A FEW SECONDS BEFOREHAND IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GUESS IT
WAS ALWAYS FROM BEHIND WALKING DOWN A CORRIDOR TEN SECONDS WOULD BE
ENOUGH IN THAT TIME THE WORLD INSIDE HIM COULD TURN OVER AND THEN
SUDDENLY WITHOUT A WORD UTTERED WITHOUT A CHECK IN HIS STEP WITHOUT THE
CHANGING OF A LINE IN HIS FACESUDDENLY THE CAMOUFLAGE WOULD BE DOWN AND
BANG WOULD GO THE BATTERIES OF HIS HATRED HATRED WOULD FILL HIM LIKE AN
ENORMOUS ROARING FLAME AND ALMOST IN THE SAME INSTANT BANG WOULD GO THE
BULLET TOO LATE OR TOO EARLY THEY WOULD HAVE BLOWN HIS BRAIN TO PIECES
BEFORE THEY COULD RECLAIM IT THE HERETICAL THOUGHT WOULD BE UNPUNISHED
UNREPENTED OUT OF THEIR REACH FOR EVER THEY WOULD HAVE BLOWN A HOLE IN
THEIR OWN PERFECTION TO DIE HATING THEM THAT WAS FREEDOM

HE SHUT HIS EYES IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ACCEPTING AN INTELLECTUAL
DISCIPLINE IT WAS A QUESTION OF DEGRADING HIMSELF MUTILATING HIMSELF HE
HAD GOT TO PLUNGE INTO THE FILTHIEST OF FILTH WHAT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE
SICKENING THING OF ALL HE THOUGHT OF BIG BROTHER THE ENORMOUS FACE
BECAUSE OF CONSTANTLY SEEING IT ON POSTERS HE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS
BEING A METRE WIDE WITH ITS HEAVY BLACK MOUSTACHE AND THE EYES THAT
FOLLOWED YOU TO AND FRO SEEMED TO FLOAT INTO HIS MIND OF ITS OWN ACCORD
WHAT WERE HIS TRUE FEELINGS TOWARDS BIG BROTHER

THERE WAS A HEAVY TRAMP OF BOOTS IN THE PASSAGE THE STEEL DOOR SWUNG OPEN
WITH A CLANG OBRIEN WALKED INTO THE CELL BEHIND HIM WERE THE WAXENFACED
OFFICER AND THE BLACKUNIFORMED GUARDS

GET UP SAID OBRIEN COME HERE

WINSTON STOOD OPPOSITE HIM OBRIEN TOOK WINSTONS SHOULDERS BETWEEN HIS
STRONG HANDS AND LOOKED AT HIM CLOSELY

YOU HAVE HAD THOUGHTS OF DECEIVING ME HE SAID THAT WAS STUPID
STAND UP STRAIGHTER LOOK ME IN THE FACE

HE PAUSED AND WENT ON IN A GENTLER TONE

YOU ARE IMPROVING INTELLECTUALLY THERE IS VERY LITTLE WRONG WITH YOU
IT IS ONLY EMOTIONALLY THAT YOU HAVE FAILED TO MAKE PROGRESS TELL ME
WINSTONAND REMEMBER NO LIES YOU KNOW THAT I AM ALWAYS ABLE TO DETECT
A LIETELL ME WHAT ARE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS TOWARDS BIG BROTHER

I HATE HIM

YOU HATE HIM GOOD THEN THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU TO TAKE THE LAST STEP
YOU MUST LOVE BIG BROTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO OBEY HIM YOU MUST LOVE
HIM

HE RELEASED WINSTON WITH A LITTLE PUSH TOWARDS THE GUARDS

ROOM 101 HE SAID




CHAPTER 5



AT EACH STAGE OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD KNOWN OR SEEMED TO KNOW
WHEREABOUTS HE WAS IN THE WINDOWLESS BUILDING POSSIBLY THERE WERE SLIGHT
DIFFERENCES IN THE AIR PRESSURE THE CELLS WHERE THE GUARDS HAD BEATEN HIM
WERE BELOW GROUND LEVEL THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN INTERROGATED BY
OBRIEN WAS HIGH UP NEAR THE ROOF THIS PLACE WAS MANY METRES UNDERGROUND
AS DEEP DOWN AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GO

IT WAS BIGGER THAN MOST OF THE CELLS HE HAD BEEN IN BUT HE HARDLY NOTICED
HIS SURROUNDINGS ALL HE NOTICED WAS THAT THERE WERE TWO SMALL TABLES
STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM EACH COVERED WITH GREEN BAIZE ONE WAS ONLY A
METRE OR TWO FROM HIM THE OTHER WAS FURTHER AWAY NEAR THE DOOR HE WAS
STRAPPED UPRIGHT IN A CHAIR SO TIGHTLY THAT HE COULD MOVE NOTHING NOT
EVEN HIS HEAD A SORT OF PAD GRIPPED HIS HEAD FROM BEHIND FORCING HIM TO
LOOK STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM

FOR A MOMENT HE WAS ALONE THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND OBRIEN CAME IN

YOU ASKED ME ONCE SAID OBRIEN WHAT WAS IN ROOM 101 I TOLD YOU THAT
YOU KNEW THE ANSWER ALREADY EVERYONE KNOWS IT THE THING THAT IS IN
ROOM 101 IS THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD

THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN A GUARD CAME IN CARRYING SOMETHING MADE OF WIRE
A BOX OR BASKET OF SOME KIND HE SET IT DOWN ON THE FURTHER TABLE BECAUSE
OF THE POSITION IN WHICH OBRIEN WAS STANDING WINSTON COULD NOT SEE WHAT
THE THING WAS

THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD SAID OBRIEN VARIES FROM INDIVIDUAL TO
INDIVIDUAL IT MAY BE BURIAL ALIVE OR DEATH BY FIRE OR BY DROWNING OR
BY IMPALEMENT OR FIFTY OTHER DEATHS THERE ARE CASES WHERE IT IS SOME
QUITE TRIVIAL THING NOT EVEN FATAL

HE HAD MOVED A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE SO THAT WINSTON HAD A BETTER VIEW OF
THE THING ON THE TABLE IT WAS AN OBLONG WIRE CAGE WITH A HANDLE ON TOP
FOR CARRYING IT BY FIXED TO THE FRONT OF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED
LIKE A FENCING MASK WITH THE CONCAVE SIDE OUTWARDS ALTHOUGH IT WAS THREE
OR FOUR METRES AWAY FROM HIM HE COULD SEE THAT THE CAGE WAS DIVIDED
LENGTHWAYS INTO TWO COMPARTMENTS AND THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF CREATURE
IN EACH THEY WERE RATS

IN YOUR CASE SAID OBRIEN THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD HAPPENS TO BE
RATS

A SORT OF PREMONITORY TREMOR A FEAR OF HE WAS NOT CERTAIN WHAT HAD
PASSED THROUGH WINSTON AS SOON AS HE CAUGHT HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE CAGE
BUT AT THIS MOMENT THE MEANING OF THE MASKLIKE ATTACHMENT IN FRONT OF IT
SUDDENLY SANK INTO HIM HIS BOWELS SEEMED TO TURN TO WATER

YOU CANT DO THAT HE CRIED OUT IN A HIGH CRACKED VOICE YOU COULDNT
YOU COULDNT ITS IMPOSSIBLE

DO YOU REMEMBER SAID OBRIEN THE MOMENT OF PANIC THAT USED TO OCCUR
IN YOUR DREAMS THERE WAS A WALL OF BLACKNESS IN FRONT OF YOU AND A
ROARING SOUND IN YOUR EARS THERE WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WALL YOU KNEW THAT YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT YOU DARED NOT DRAG IT
INTO THE OPEN IT WAS THE RATS THAT WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

OBRIEN SAID WINSTON MAKING AN EFFORT TO CONTROL HIS VOICE YOU KNOW
THIS IS NOT NECESSARY WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO

OBRIEN MADE NO DIRECT ANSWER WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS IN THE SCHOOLMASTERISH
MANNER THAT HE SOMETIMES AFFECTED HE LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY INTO THE
DISTANCE AS THOUGH HE WERE ADDRESSING AN AUDIENCE SOMEWHERE BEHIND
WINSTONS BACK

BY ITSELF HE SAID PAIN IS NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHEN
A HUMAN BEING WILL STAND OUT AGAINST PAIN EVEN TO THE POINT OF DEATH
BUT FOR EVERYONE THERE IS SOMETHING UNENDURABLESOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE
CONTEMPLATED COURAGE AND COWARDICE ARE NOT INVOLVED IF YOU ARE FALLING
FROM A HEIGHT IT IS NOT COWARDLY TO CLUTCH AT A ROPE IF YOU HAVE COME UP
FROM DEEP WATER IT IS NOT COWARDLY TO FILL YOUR LUNGS WITH AIR IT IS
MERELY AN INSTINCT WHICH CANNOT BE DESTROYED IT IS THE SAME WITH THE
RATS FOR YOU THEY ARE UNENDURABLE THEY ARE A FORM OF PRESSURE THAT YOU
CANNOT WITHSTAND EVEN IF YOU WISHED TO YOU WILL DO WHAT IS REQUIRED OF
YOU

BUT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT HOW CAN I DO IT IF I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS

OBRIEN PICKED UP THE CAGE AND BROUGHT IT ACROSS TO THE NEARER TABLE
HE SET IT DOWN CAREFULLY ON THE BAIZE CLOTH WINSTON COULD HEAR THE BLOOD
SINGING IN HIS EARS HE HAD THE FEELING OF SITTING IN UTTER LONELINESS
HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT EMPTY PLAIN A FLAT DESERT DRENCHED WITH
SUNLIGHT ACROSS WHICH ALL SOUNDS CAME TO HIM OUT OF IMMENSE DISTANCES
YET THE CAGE WITH THE RATS WAS NOT TWO METRES AWAY FROM HIM THEY WERE
ENORMOUS RATS THEY WERE AT THE AGE WHEN A RATS MUZZLE GROWS BLUNT AND
FIERCE AND HIS FUR BROWN INSTEAD OF GREY

THE RAT SAID OBRIEN STILL ADDRESSING HIS INVISIBLE AUDIENCE
ALTHOUGH A RODENT IS CARNIVOROUS YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT YOU WILL HAVE
HEARD OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE POOR QUARTERS OF THIS TOWN IN SOME
STREETS A WOMAN DARE NOT LEAVE HER BABY ALONE IN THE HOUSE EVEN FOR FIVE
MINUTES THE RATS ARE CERTAIN TO ATTACK IT WITHIN QUITE A SMALL TIME THEY
WILL STRIP IT TO THE BONES THEY ALSO ATTACK SICK OR DYING PEOPLE THEY
SHOW ASTONISHING INTELLIGENCE IN KNOWING WHEN A HUMAN BEING IS HELPLESS

THERE WAS AN OUTBURST OF SQUEALS FROM THE CAGE IT SEEMED TO REACH WINSTON
FROM FAR AWAY THE RATS WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE TRYING TO GET AT EACH
OTHER THROUGH THE PARTITION HE HEARD ALSO A DEEP GROAN OF DESPAIR
THAT TOO SEEMED TO COME FROM OUTSIDE HIMSELF

OBRIEN PICKED UP THE CAGE AND AS HE DID SO PRESSED SOMETHING IN IT
THERE WAS A SHARP CLICK WINSTON MADE A FRANTIC EFFORT TO TEAR HIMSELF
LOOSE FROM THE CHAIR IT WAS HOPELESS EVERY PART OF HIM EVEN HIS HEAD
WAS HELD IMMOVABLY OBRIEN MOVED THE CAGE NEARER IT WAS LESS THAN A
METRE FROM WINSTONS FACE

I HAVE PRESSED THE FIRST LEVER SAID OBRIEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS CAGE THE MASK WILL FIT OVER YOUR HEAD LEAVING NO
EXIT WHEN I PRESS THIS OTHER LEVER THE DOOR OF THE CAGE WILL SLIDE UP
THESE STARVING BRUTES WILL SHOOT OUT OF IT LIKE BULLETS HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN A RAT LEAP THROUGH THE AIR THEY WILL LEAP ON TO YOUR FACE AND BORE
STRAIGHT INTO IT SOMETIMES THEY ATTACK THE EYES FIRST SOMETIMES THEY
BURROW THROUGH THE CHEEKS AND DEVOUR THE TONGUE

THE CAGE WAS NEARER IT WAS CLOSING IN WINSTON HEARD A SUCCESSION OF
SHRILL CRIES WHICH APPEARED TO BE OCCURRING IN THE AIR ABOVE HIS HEAD BUT
HE FOUGHT FURIOUSLY AGAINST HIS PANIC TO THINK TO THINK EVEN WITH A
SPLIT SECOND LEFTTO THINK WAS THE ONLY HOPE SUDDENLY THE FOUL MUSTY
ODOUR OF THE BRUTES STRUCK HIS NOSTRILS THERE WAS A VIOLENT CONVULSION OF
NAUSEA INSIDE HIM AND HE ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS EVERYTHING HAD GONE
BLACK FOR AN INSTANT HE WAS INSANE A SCREAMING ANIMAL YET HE CAME OUT
OF THE BLACKNESS CLUTCHING AN IDEA THERE WAS ONE AND ONLY ONE WAY TO SAVE
HIMSELF HE MUST INTERPOSE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THE BODY OF ANOTHER HUMAN
BEING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE RATS

THE CIRCLE OF THE MASK WAS LARGE ENOUGH NOW TO SHUT OUT THE VISION OF
ANYTHING ELSE THE WIRE DOOR WAS A COUPLE OF HANDSPANS FROM HIS FACE THE
RATS KNEW WHAT WAS COMING NOW ONE OF THEM WAS LEAPING UP AND DOWN THE
OTHER AN OLD SCALY GRANDFATHER OF THE SEWERS STOOD UP WITH HIS PINK
HANDS AGAINST THE BARS AND FIERCELY SNIFFED THE AIR WINSTON COULD SEE
THE WHISKERS AND THE YELLOW TEETH AGAIN THE BLACK PANIC TOOK HOLD OF HIM
HE WAS BLIND HELPLESS MINDLESS

IT WAS A COMMON PUNISHMENT IN IMPERIAL CHINA SAID OBRIEN AS
DIDACTICALLY AS EVER

THE MASK WAS CLOSING ON HIS FACE THE WIRE BRUSHED HIS CHEEK AND THENNO
IT WAS NOT RELIEF ONLY HOPE A TINY FRAGMENT OF HOPE TOO LATE PERHAPS
TOO LATE BUT HE HAD SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IN THE WHOLE WORLD THERE WAS
JUST ONE PERSON TO WHOM HE COULD TRANSFER HIS PUNISHMENTONE BODY THAT HE
COULD THRUST BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE RATS AND HE WAS SHOUTING FRANTICALLY
OVER AND OVER

DO IT TO JULIA DO IT TO JULIA NOT ME JULIA I DONT CARE WHAT YOU DO
TO HER TEAR HER FACE OFF STRIP HER TO THE BONES NOT ME JULIA NOT ME

HE WAS FALLING BACKWARDS INTO ENORMOUS DEPTHS AWAY FROM THE RATS HE WAS
STILL STRAPPED IN THE CHAIR BUT HE HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE FLOOR THROUGH
THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING THROUGH THE EARTH THROUGH THE OCEANS THROUGH
THE ATMOSPHERE INTO OUTER SPACE INTO THE GULFS BETWEEN THE STARSALWAYS
AWAY AWAY AWAY FROM THE RATS HE WAS LIGHT YEARS DISTANT BUT OBRIEN
WAS STILL STANDING AT HIS SIDE THERE WAS STILL THE COLD TOUCH OF WIRE
AGAINST HIS CHEEK BUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS THAT ENVELOPED HIM HE HEARD
ANOTHER METALLIC CLICK AND KNEW THAT THE CAGE DOOR HAD CLICKED SHUT AND
NOT OPEN




CHAPTER 6



THE CHESTNUT TREE WAS ALMOST EMPTY A RAY OF SUNLIGHT SLANTING THROUGH A
WINDOW FELL ON DUSTY TABLETOPS IT WAS THE LONELY HOUR OF FIFTEEN A
TINNY MUSIC TRICKLED FROM THE TELESCREENS

WINSTON SAT IN HIS USUAL CORNER GAZING INTO AN EMPTY GLASS NOW AND AGAIN
HE GLANCED UP AT A VAST FACE WHICH EYED HIM FROM THE OPPOSITE WALL
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU THE CAPTION SAID UNBIDDEN A WAITER CAME AND
FILLED HIS GLASS UP WITH VICTORY GIN SHAKING INTO IT A FEW DROPS FROM
ANOTHER BOTTLE WITH A QUILL THROUGH THE CORK IT WAS SACCHARINE FLAVOURED
WITH CLOVES THE SPECIALITY OF THE CAFE

WINSTON WAS LISTENING TO THE TELESCREEN AT PRESENT ONLY MUSIC WAS COMING
OUT OF IT BUT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT AT ANY MOMENT THERE MIGHT BE
A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM THE MINISTRY OF PEACE THE NEWS FROM THE AFRICAN
FRONT WAS DISQUIETING IN THE EXTREME ON AND OFF HE HAD BEEN WORRYING
ABOUT IT ALL DAY A EURASIAN ARMY OCEANIA WAS AT WAR WITH EURASIA
OCEANIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH EURASIA WAS MOVING SOUTHWARD AT
TERRIFYING SPEED THE MIDDAY BULLETIN HAD NOT MENTIONED ANY DEFINITE
AREA BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT ALREADY THE MOUTH OF THE CONGO WAS A
BATTLEFIELD BRAZZAVILLE AND LEOPOLDVILLE WERE IN DANGER ONE DID NOT HAVE
TO LOOK AT THE MAP TO SEE WHAT IT MEANT IT WAS NOT MERELY A QUESTION OF
LOSING CENTRAL AFRICA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE WHOLE WAR THE TERRITORY
OF OCEANIA ITSELF WAS MENACED

A VIOLENT EMOTION NOT FEAR EXACTLY BUT A SORT OF UNDIFFERENTIATED
EXCITEMENT FLARED UP IN HIM THEN FADED AGAIN HE STOPPED THINKING ABOUT
THE WAR IN THESE DAYS HE COULD NEVER FIX HIS MIND ON ANY ONE SUBJECT FOR
MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS AT A TIME HE PICKED UP HIS GLASS AND DRAINED IT
AT A GULP AS ALWAYS THE GIN MADE HIM SHUDDER AND EVEN RETCH SLIGHTLY
THE STUFF WAS HORRIBLE THE CLOVES AND SACCHARINE THEMSELVES DISGUSTING
ENOUGH IN THEIR SICKLY WAY COULD NOT DISGUISE THE FLAT OILY SMELL AND
WHAT WAS WORST OF ALL WAS THAT THE SMELL OF GIN WHICH DWELT WITH HIM
NIGHT AND DAY WAS INEXTRICABLY MIXED UP IN HIS MIND WITH THE SMELL OF
THOSE

HE NEVER NAMED THEM EVEN IN HIS THOUGHTS AND SO FAR AS IT WAS POSSIBLE
HE NEVER VISUALIZED THEM THEY WERE SOMETHING THAT HE WAS HALFAWARE OF
HOVERING CLOSE TO HIS FACE A SMELL THAT CLUNG TO HIS NOSTRILS AS THE GIN
ROSE IN HIM HE BELCHED THROUGH PURPLE LIPS HE HAD GROWN FATTER SINCE THEY
RELEASED HIM AND HAD REGAINED HIS OLD COLOURINDEED MORE THAN REGAINED
IT HIS FEATURES HAD THICKENED THE SKIN ON NOSE AND CHEEKBONES WAS
COARSELY RED EVEN THE BALD SCALP WAS TOO DEEP A PINK A WAITER AGAIN
UNBIDDEN BROUGHT THE CHESSBOARD AND THE CURRENT ISSUE OF THE TIMES
WITH THE PAGE TURNED DOWN AT THE CHESS PROBLEM THEN SEEING THAT WINSTONS
GLASS WAS EMPTY HE BROUGHT THE GIN BOTTLE AND FILLED IT THERE WAS NO
NEED TO GIVE ORDERS THEY KNEW HIS HABITS THE CHESSBOARD WAS ALWAYS
WAITING FOR HIM HIS CORNER TABLE WAS ALWAYS RESERVED EVEN WHEN THE PLACE
WAS FULL HE HAD IT TO HIMSELF SINCE NOBODY CARED TO BE SEEN SITTING TOO
CLOSE TO HIM HE NEVER EVEN BOTHERED TO COUNT HIS DRINKS AT IRREGULAR
INTERVALS THEY PRESENTED HIM WITH A DIRTY SLIP OF PAPER WHICH THEY SAID
WAS THE BILL BUT HE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ALWAYS UNDERCHARGED HIM
IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE IF IT HAD BEEN THE OTHER WAY ABOUT HE
HAD ALWAYS PLENTY OF MONEY NOWADAYS HE EVEN HAD A JOB A SINECURE MORE
HIGHLYPAID THAN HIS OLD JOB HAD BEEN

THE MUSIC FROM THE TELESCREEN STOPPED AND A VOICE TOOK OVER WINSTON RAISED
HIS HEAD TO LISTEN NO BULLETINS FROM THE FRONT HOWEVER IT WAS MERELY A
BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE MINISTRY OF PLENTY IN THE PRECEDING QUARTER
IT APPEARED THE TENTH THREEYEAR PLANS QUOTA FOR BOOTLACES HAD BEEN
OVERFULFILLED BY 98 PER CENT

HE EXAMINED THE CHESS PROBLEM AND SET OUT THE PIECES IT WAS A TRICKY
ENDING INVOLVING A COUPLE OF KNIGHTS WHITE TO PLAY AND MATE IN TWO
MOVES WINSTON LOOKED UP AT THE PORTRAIT OF BIG BROTHER WHITE ALWAYS
MATES HE THOUGHT WITH A SORT OF CLOUDY MYSTICISM ALWAYS WITHOUT
EXCEPTION IT IS SO ARRANGED IN NO CHESS PROBLEM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF
THE WORLD HAS BLACK EVER WON DID IT NOT SYMBOLIZE THE ETERNAL UNVARYING
TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER EVIL THE HUGE FACE GAZED BACK AT HIM FULL OF CALM
POWER WHITE ALWAYS MATES

THE VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN PAUSED AND ADDED IN A DIFFERENT AND MUCH
GRAVER TONE YOU ARE WARNED TO STAND BY FOR AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT AT
FIFTEENTHIRTY FIFTEENTHIRTY THIS IS NEWS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE
TAKE CARE NOT TO MISS IT FIFTEENTHIRTY THE TINKLING MUSIC STRUCK UP
AGAIN

WINSTONS HEART STIRRED THAT WAS THE BULLETIN FROM THE FRONT INSTINCT
TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS BAD NEWS THAT WAS COMING ALL DAY WITH LITTLE SPURTS
OF EXCITEMENT THE THOUGHT OF A SMASHING DEFEAT IN AFRICA HAD BEEN IN AND
OUT OF HIS MIND HE SEEMED ACTUALLY TO SEE THE EURASIAN ARMY SWARMING
ACROSS THE NEVERBROKEN FRONTIER AND POURING DOWN INTO THE TIP OF AFRICA
LIKE A COLUMN OF ANTS WHY HAD IT NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO OUTFLANK THEM IN
SOME WAY THE OUTLINE OF THE WEST AFRICAN COAST STOOD OUT VIVIDLY IN HIS
MIND HE PICKED UP THE WHITE KNIGHT AND MOVED IT ACROSS THE BOARD THERE
WAS THE PROPER SPOT EVEN WHILE HE SAW THE BLACK HORDE RACING SOUTHWARD HE
SAW ANOTHER FORCE MYSTERIOUSLY ASSEMBLED SUDDENLY PLANTED IN THEIR REAR
CUTTING THEIR COMMUNICATIONS BY LAND AND SEA HE FELT THAT BY WILLING IT HE
WAS BRINGING THAT OTHER FORCE INTO EXISTENCE BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ACT
QUICKLY IF THEY COULD GET CONTROL OF THE WHOLE OF AFRICA IF THEY HAD
AIRFIELDS AND SUBMARINE BASES AT THE CAPE IT WOULD CUT OCEANIA IN TWO IT
MIGHT MEAN ANYTHING DEFEAT BREAKDOWN THE REDIVISION OF THE WORLD THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE PARTY HE DREW A DEEP BREATH AN EXTRAORDINARY MEDLEY
OF FEELINGBUT IT WAS NOT A MEDLEY EXACTLY RATHER IT WAS SUCCESSIVE
LAYERS OF FEELING IN WHICH ONE COULD NOT SAY WHICH LAYER WAS
UNDERMOSTSTRUGGLED INSIDE HIM

THE SPASM PASSED HE PUT THE WHITE KNIGHT BACK IN ITS PLACE BUT FOR THE
MOMENT HE COULD NOT SETTLE DOWN TO SERIOUS STUDY OF THE CHESS PROBLEM
HIS THOUGHTS WANDERED AGAIN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY HE TRACED WITH HIS
FINGER IN THE DUST ON THE TABLE

225

THEY CANT GET INSIDE YOU SHE HAD SAID BUT THEY COULD GET INSIDE YOU
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU HERE IS FOR EVER OBRIEN HAD SAID THAT WAS A TRUE
WORD THERE WERE THINGS YOUR OWN ACTS FROM WHICH YOU COULD NEVER RECOVER
SOMETHING WAS KILLED IN YOUR BREAST BURNT OUT CAUTERIZED OUT

HE HAD SEEN HER HE HAD EVEN SPOKEN TO HER THERE WAS NO DANGER IN IT HE
KNEW AS THOUGH INSTINCTIVELY THAT THEY NOW TOOK ALMOST NO INTEREST IN HIS
DOINGS HE COULD HAVE ARRANGED TO MEET HER A SECOND TIME IF EITHER OF THEM
HAD WANTED TO ACTUALLY IT WAS BY CHANCE THAT THEY HAD MET IT WAS IN THE
PARK ON A VILE BITING DAY IN MARCH WHEN THE EARTH WAS LIKE IRON AND
ALL THE GRASS SEEMED DEAD AND THERE WAS NOT A BUD ANYWHERE EXCEPT A FEW
CROCUSES WHICH HAD PUSHED THEMSELVES UP TO BE DISMEMBERED BY THE WIND HE
WAS HURRYING ALONG WITH FROZEN HANDS AND WATERING EYES WHEN HE SAW HER NOT
TEN METRES AWAY FROM HIM IT STRUCK HIM AT ONCE THAT SHE HAD CHANGED IN
SOME ILLDEFINED WAY THEY ALMOST PASSED ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT A SIGN THEN
HE TURNED AND FOLLOWED HER NOT VERY EAGERLY HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO
DANGER NOBODY WOULD TAKE ANY INTEREST IN HIM SHE DID NOT SPEAK SHE
WALKED OBLIQUELY AWAY ACROSS THE GRASS AS THOUGH TRYING TO GET RID OF HIM
THEN SEEMED TO RESIGN HERSELF TO HAVING HIM AT HER SIDE PRESENTLY THEY
WERE IN AMONG A CLUMP OF RAGGED LEAFLESS SHRUBS USELESS EITHER FOR
CONCEALMENT OR AS PROTECTION FROM THE WIND THEY HALTED IT WAS VILELY
COLD THE WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE TWIGS AND FRETTED THE OCCASIONAL
DIRTYLOOKING CROCUSES HE PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER WAIST

THERE WAS NO TELESCREEN BUT THERE MUST BE HIDDEN MICROPHONES BESIDES
THEY COULD BE SEEN IT DID NOT MATTER NOTHING MATTERED THEY COULD HAVE
LAIN DOWN ON THE GROUND AND DONE THAT IF THEY HAD WANTED TO HIS FLESH
FROZE WITH HORROR AT THE THOUGHT OF IT SHE MADE NO RESPONSE WHATEVER TO
THE CLASP OF HIS ARM SHE DID NOT EVEN TRY TO DISENGAGE HERSELF HE KNEW
NOW WHAT HAD CHANGED IN HER HER FACE WAS SALLOWER AND THERE WAS A LONG
SCAR PARTLY HIDDEN BY THE HAIR ACROSS HER FOREHEAD AND TEMPLE BUT THAT
WAS NOT THE CHANGE IT WAS THAT HER WAIST HAD GROWN THICKER AND IN A
SURPRISING WAY HAD STIFFENED HE REMEMBERED HOW ONCE AFTER THE EXPLOSION
OF A ROCKET BOMB HE HAD HELPED TO DRAG A CORPSE OUT OF SOME RUINS AND
HAD BEEN ASTONISHED NOT ONLY BY THE INCREDIBLE WEIGHT OF THE THING BUT BY
ITS RIGIDITY AND AWKWARDNESS TO HANDLE WHICH MADE IT SEEM MORE LIKE STONE
THAN FLESH HER BODY FELT LIKE THAT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TEXTURE
OF HER SKIN WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT HAD ONCE BEEN

HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO KISS HER NOR DID THEY SPEAK AS THEY WALKED BACK
ACROSS THE GRASS SHE LOOKED DIRECTLY AT HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IT
WAS ONLY A MOMENTARY GLANCE FULL OF CONTEMPT AND DISLIKE HE WONDERED
WHETHER IT WAS A DISLIKE THAT CAME PURELY OUT OF THE PAST OR WHETHER IT
WAS INSPIRED ALSO BY HIS BLOATED FACE AND THE WATER THAT THE WIND KEPT
SQUEEZING FROM HIS EYES THEY SAT DOWN ON TWO IRON CHAIRS SIDE BY SIDE
BUT NOT TOO CLOSE TOGETHER HE SAW THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK SHE MOVED
HER CLUMSY SHOE A FEW CENTIMETRES AND DELIBERATELY CRUSHED A TWIG HER
FEET SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN BROADER HE NOTICED

I BETRAYED YOU SHE SAID BALDLY

I BETRAYED YOU HE SAID

SHE GAVE HIM ANOTHER QUICK LOOK OF DISLIKE

SOMETIMES SHE SAID THEY THREATEN YOU WITH SOMETHING SOMETHING YOU
CANT STAND UP TO CANT EVEN THINK ABOUT AND THEN YOU SAY DONT DO IT
TO ME DO IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT TO SOANDSO AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHT
PRETEND AFTERWARDS THAT IT WAS ONLY A TRICK AND THAT YOU JUST SAID IT TO
MAKE THEM STOP AND DIDNT REALLY MEAN IT BUT THAT ISNT TRUE AT THE TIME
WHEN IT HAPPENS YOU DO MEAN IT YOU THINK THERES NO OTHER WAY OF SAVING
YOURSELF AND YOURE QUITE READY TO SAVE YOURSELF THAT WAY YOU WANT IT TO
HAPPEN TO THE OTHER PERSON YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT THEY SUFFER ALL
YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOURSELF

ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOURSELF HE ECHOED

AND AFTER THAT YOU DONT FEEL THE SAME TOWARDS THE OTHER PERSON ANY
LONGER

NO HE SAID YOU DONT FEEL THE SAME

THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY THE WIND PLASTERED THEIR
THIN OVERALLS AGAINST THEIR BODIES ALMOST AT ONCE IT BECAME EMBARRASSING
TO SIT THERE IN SILENCE BESIDES IT WAS TOO COLD TO KEEP STILL SHE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT CATCHING HER TUBE AND STOOD UP TO GO

WE MUST MEET AGAIN HE SAID

YES SHE SAID WE MUST MEET AGAIN

HE FOLLOWED IRRESOLUTELY FOR A LITTLE DISTANCE HALF A PACE BEHIND HER
THEY DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN SHE DID NOT ACTUALLY TRY TO SHAKE HIM OFF BUT
WALKED AT JUST SUCH A SPEED AS TO PREVENT HIS KEEPING ABREAST OF HER
HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD ACCOMPANY HER AS FAR AS THE TUBE
STATION BUT SUDDENLY THIS PROCESS OF TRAILING ALONG IN THE COLD SEEMED
POINTLESS AND UNBEARABLE HE WAS OVERWHELMED BY A DESIRE NOT SO MUCH TO
GET AWAY FROM JULIA AS TO GET BACK TO THE CHESTNUT TREE CAFE WHICH HAD
NEVER SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE AS AT THIS MOMENT HE HAD A NOSTALGIC VISION
OF HIS CORNER TABLE WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND THE CHESSBOARD AND THE
EVERFLOWING GIN ABOVE ALL IT WOULD BE WARM IN THERE THE NEXT MOMENT
NOT ALTOGETHER BY ACCIDENT HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME SEPARATED FROM
HER BY A SMALL KNOT OF PEOPLE HE MADE A HALFHEARTED ATTEMPT TO CATCH UP
THEN SLOWED DOWN TURNED AND MADE OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHEN HE
HAD GONE FIFTY METRES HE LOOKED BACK THE STREET WAS NOT CROWDED BUT
ALREADY HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH HER ANY ONE OF A DOZEN HURRYING FIGURES
MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERS PERHAPS HER THICKENED STIFFENED BODY WAS NO LONGER
RECOGNIZABLE FROM BEHIND

AT THE TIME WHEN IT HAPPENS SHE HAD SAID YOU DO MEAN IT HE HAD
MEANT IT HE HAD NOT MERELY SAID IT HE HAD WISHED IT HE HAD WISHED THAT
SHE AND NOT HE SHOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE

SOMETHING CHANGED IN THE MUSIC THAT TRICKLED FROM THE TELESCREEN A
CRACKED AND JEERING NOTE A YELLOW NOTE CAME INTO IT AND THENPERHAPS
IT WAS NOT HAPPENING PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY A MEMORY TAKING ON THE SEMBLANCE
OF SOUNDA VOICE WAS SINGING


UNDER THE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREE
I SOLD YOU AND YOU SOLD ME


THE TEARS WELLED UP IN HIS EYES A PASSING WAITER NOTICED THAT HIS GLASS
WAS EMPTY AND CAME BACK WITH THE GIN BOTTLE

HE TOOK UP HIS GLASS AND SNIFFED AT IT THE STUFF GREW NOT LESS BUT MORE
HORRIBLE WITH EVERY MOUTHFUL HE DRANK BUT IT HAD BECOME THE ELEMENT HE
SWAM IN IT WAS HIS LIFE HIS DEATH AND HIS RESURRECTION IT WAS GIN THAT
SANK HIM INTO STUPOR EVERY NIGHT AND GIN THAT REVIVED HIM EVERY MORNING
WHEN HE WOKE SELDOM BEFORE ELEVEN HUNDRED WITH GUMMEDUP EYELIDS AND
FIERY MOUTH AND A BACK THAT SEEMED TO BE BROKEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO RISE FROM THE HORIZONTAL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE
BOTTLE AND TEACUP PLACED BESIDE THE BED OVERNIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDAY
HOURS HE SAT WITH GLAZED FACE THE BOTTLE HANDY LISTENING TO THE
TELESCREEN FROM FIFTEEN TO CLOSINGTIME HE WAS A FIXTURE IN THE CHESTNUT
TREE NO ONE CARED WHAT HE DID ANY LONGER NO WHISTLE WOKE HIM NO
TELESCREEN ADMONISHED HIM OCCASIONALLY PERHAPS TWICE A WEEK HE WENT
TO A DUSTY FORGOTTENLOOKING OFFICE IN THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH AND DID
A LITTLE WORK OR WHAT WAS CALLED WORK HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO A
SUBCOMMITTEE OF A SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH HAD SPROUTED FROM ONE OF THE
INNUMERABLE COMMITTEES DEALING WITH MINOR DIFFICULTIES THAT AROSE IN THE
COMPILATION OF THE ELEVENTH EDITION OF THE NEWSPEAK DICTIONARY THEY WERE
ENGAGED IN PRODUCING SOMETHING CALLED AN INTERIM REPORT BUT WHAT IT WAS
THAT THEY WERE REPORTING ON HE HAD NEVER DEFINITELY FOUND OUT IT WAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER COMMAS SHOULD BE PLACED
INSIDE BRACKETS OR OUTSIDE THERE WERE FOUR OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE ALL
OF THEM PERSONS SIMILAR TO HIMSELF THERE WERE DAYS WHEN THEY ASSEMBLED
AND THEN PROMPTLY DISPERSED AGAIN FRANKLY ADMITTING TO ONE ANOTHER THAT
THERE WAS NOT REALLY ANYTHING TO BE DONE BUT THERE WERE OTHER DAYS WHEN
THEY SETTLED DOWN TO THEIR WORK ALMOST EAGERLY MAKING A TREMENDOUS SHOW
OF ENTERING UP THEIR MINUTES AND DRAFTING LONG MEMORANDA WHICH WERE NEVER
FINISHEDWHEN THE ARGUMENT AS TO WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY ARGUING ABOUT
GREW EXTRAORDINARILY INVOLVED AND ABSTRUSE WITH SUBTLE HAGGLING OVER
DEFINITIONS ENORMOUS DIGRESSIONS QUARRELSTHREATS EVEN TO APPEAL TO
HIGHER AUTHORITY AND THEN SUDDENLY THE LIFE WOULD GO OUT OF THEM AND
THEY WOULD SIT ROUND THE TABLE LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER WITH EXTINCT EYES
LIKE GHOSTS FADING AT COCKCROW

THE TELESCREEN WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT WINSTON RAISED HIS HEAD AGAIN THE
BULLETIN BUT NO THEY WERE MERELY CHANGING THE MUSIC HE HAD THE MAP OF
AFRICA BEHIND HIS EYELIDS THE MOVEMENT OF THE ARMIES WAS A DIAGRAM A
BLACK ARROW TEARING VERTICALLY SOUTHWARD AND A WHITE ARROW HORIZONTALLY
EASTWARD ACROSS THE TAIL OF THE FIRST AS THOUGH FOR REASSURANCE HE
LOOKED UP AT THE IMPERTURBABLE FACE IN THE PORTRAIT WAS IT CONCEIVABLE
THAT THE SECOND ARROW DID NOT EVEN EXIST

HIS INTEREST FLAGGED AGAIN HE DRANK ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF GIN PICKED UP
THE WHITE KNIGHT AND MADE A TENTATIVE MOVE CHECK BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY
NOT THE RIGHT MOVE BECAUSE

UNCALLED A MEMORY FLOATED INTO HIS MIND HE SAW A CANDLELIT ROOM WITH A
VAST WHITECOUNTERPANED BED AND HIMSELF A BOY OF NINE OR TEN SITTING ON
THE FLOOR SHAKING A DICEBOX AND LAUGHING EXCITEDLY HIS MOTHER WAS
SITTING OPPOSITE HIM AND ALSO LAUGHING

IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED IT WAS A MOMENT OF
RECONCILIATION WHEN THE NAGGING HUNGER IN HIS BELLY WAS FORGOTTEN AND HIS
EARLIER AFFECTION FOR HER HAD TEMPORARILY REVIVED HE REMEMBERED THE DAY
WELL A PELTING DRENCHING DAY WHEN THE WATER STREAMED DOWN THE WINDOWPANE
AND THE LIGHT INDOORS WAS TOO DULL TO READ BY THE BOREDOM OF THE TWO
CHILDREN IN THE DARK CRAMPED BEDROOM BECAME UNBEARABLE WINSTON WHINED
AND GRIZZLED MADE FUTILE DEMANDS FOR FOOD FRETTED ABOUT THE ROOM PULLING
EVERYTHING OUT OF PLACE AND KICKING THE WAINSCOTING UNTIL THE NEIGHBOURS
BANGED ON THE WALL WHILE THE YOUNGER CHILD WAILED INTERMITTENTLY IN THE
END HIS MOTHER SAID NOW BE GOOD AND ILL BUY YOU A TOY A LOVELY
TOYYOULL LOVE IT AND THEN SHE HAD GONE OUT IN THE RAIN TO A LITTLE
GENERAL SHOP WHICH WAS STILL SPORADICALLY OPEN NEARBY AND CAME BACK WITH
A CARDBOARD BOX CONTAINING AN OUTFIT OF SNAKES AND LADDERS HE COULD STILL
REMEMBER THE SMELL OF THE DAMP CARDBOARD IT WAS A MISERABLE OUTFIT THE
BOARD WAS CRACKED AND THE TINY WOODEN DICE WERE SO ILLCUT THAT THEY
WOULD HARDLY LIE ON THEIR SIDES WINSTON LOOKED AT THE THING SULKILY AND
WITHOUT INTEREST BUT THEN HIS MOTHER LIT A PIECE OF CANDLE AND THEY SAT
DOWN ON THE FLOOR TO PLAY SOON HE WAS WILDLY EXCITED AND SHOUTING WITH
LAUGHTER AS THE TIDDLYWINKS CLIMBED HOPEFULLY UP THE LADDERS AND THEN
CAME SLITHERING DOWN THE SNAKES AGAIN ALMOST TO THE STARTINGPOINT THEY
PLAYED EIGHT GAMES WINNING FOUR EACH HIS TINY SISTER TOO YOUNG TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GAME WAS ABOUT HAD SAT PROPPED UP AGAINST A BOLSTER
LAUGHING BECAUSE THE OTHERS WERE LAUGHING FOR A WHOLE AFTERNOON THEY HAD
ALL BEEN HAPPY TOGETHER AS IN HIS EARLIER CHILDHOOD

HE PUSHED THE PICTURE OUT OF HIS MIND IT WAS A FALSE MEMORY HE WAS
TROUBLED BY FALSE MEMORIES OCCASIONALLY THEY DID NOT MATTER SO LONG AS
ONE KNEW THEM FOR WHAT THEY WERE SOME THINGS HAD HAPPENED OTHERS HAD NOT
HAPPENED HE TURNED BACK TO THE CHESSBOARD AND PICKED UP THE WHITE KNIGHT
AGAIN ALMOST IN THE SAME INSTANT IT DROPPED ON TO THE BOARD WITH A
CLATTER HE HAD STARTED AS THOUGH A PIN HAD RUN INTO HIM

A SHRILL TRUMPETCALL HAD PIERCED THE AIR IT WAS THE BULLETIN VICTORY
IT ALWAYS MEANT VICTORY WHEN A TRUMPETCALL PRECEDED THE NEWS A SORT OF
ELECTRIC DRILL RAN THROUGH THE CAFE EVEN THE WAITERS HAD STARTED AND
PRICKED UP THEIR EARS

THE TRUMPETCALL HAD LET LOOSE AN ENORMOUS VOLUME OF NOISE ALREADY AN
EXCITED VOICE WAS GABBLING FROM THE TELESCREEN BUT EVEN AS IT STARTED
IT WAS ALMOST DROWNED BY A ROAR OF CHEERING FROM OUTSIDE THE NEWS HAD
RUN ROUND THE STREETS LIKE MAGIC HE COULD HEAR JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT WAS
ISSUING FROM THE TELESCREEN TO REALIZE THAT IT HAD ALL HAPPENED AS HE HAD
FORESEEN A VAST SEABORNE ARMADA HAD SECRETLY ASSEMBLED A SUDDEN BLOW IN

UNDER THE TABLE WINSTONS FEET MADE CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS HE HAD NOT
STIRRED FROM HIS SEAT BUT IN HIS MIND HE WAS RUNNING SWIFTLY RUNNING
HE WAS WITH THE CROWDS OUTSIDE CHEERING HIMSELF DEAF HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
AT THE PORTRAIT OF BIG BROTHER THE COLOSSUS THAT BESTRODE THE WORLD
THE ROCK AGAINST WHICH THE HORDES OF ASIA DASHED THEMSELVES IN VAIN HE
THOUGHT HOW TEN MINUTES AGOYES ONLY TEN MINUTESTHERE HAD STILL BEEN
EQUIVOCATION IN HIS HEART AS HE WONDERED WHETHER THE NEWS FROM THE FRONT
WOULD BE OF VICTORY OR DEFEAT AH IT WAS MORE THAN A EURASIAN ARMY THAT
HAD PERISHED MUCH HAD CHANGED IN HIM SINCE THAT FIRST DAY IN THE MINISTRY
OF LOVE BUT THE FINAL INDISPENSABLE HEALING CHANGE HAD NEVER HAPPENED
UNTIL THIS MOMENT

THE VOICE FROM THE TELESCREEN WAS STILL POURING FORTH ITS TALE OF PRISONERS
AND BOOTY AND SLAUGHTER BUT THE SHOUTING OUTSIDE HAD DIED DOWN A LITTLE
THE WAITERS WERE TURNING BACK TO THEIR WORK ONE OF THEM APPROACHED WITH
THE GIN BOTTLE WINSTON SITTING IN A BLISSFUL DREAM PAID NO ATTENTION
AS HIS GLASS WAS FILLED UP HE WAS NOT RUNNING OR CHEERING ANY LONGER HE
WAS BACK IN THE MINISTRY OF LOVE WITH EVERYTHING FORGIVEN HIS SOUL WHITE
AS SNOW HE WAS IN THE PUBLIC DOCK CONFESSING EVERYTHING IMPLICATING
EVERYBODY HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE WHITETILED CORRIDOR WITH THE FEELING
OF WALKING IN SUNLIGHT AND AN ARMED GUARD AT HIS BACK THE LONGHOPEDFOR
BULLET WAS ENTERING HIS BRAIN

HE GAZED UP AT THE ENORMOUS FACE FORTY YEARS IT HAD TAKEN HIM TO LEARN
WHAT KIND OF SMILE WAS HIDDEN BENEATH THE DARK MOUSTACHE O CRUEL NEEDLESS
MISUNDERSTANDING O STUBBORN SELFWILLED EXILE FROM THE LOVING BREAST
TWO GINSCENTED TEARS TRICKLED DOWN THE SIDES OF HIS NOSE BUT IT WAS ALL
RIGHT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT THE STRUGGLE WAS FINISHED HE HAD WON
THE VICTORY OVER HIMSELF HE LOVED BIG BROTHER



THE END



APPENDIX

THE PRINCIPLES OF NEWSPEAK



NEWSPEAK WAS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF OCEANIA AND HAD BEEN DEVISED TO MEET
THE IDEOLOGICAL NEEDS OF INGSOC OR ENGLISH SOCIALISM IN THE YEAR 1984
THERE WAS NOT AS YET ANYONE WHO USED NEWSPEAK AS HIS SOLE MEANS OF
COMMUNICATION EITHER IN SPEECH OR WRITING THE LEADING ARTICLES IN
THE TIMES WERE WRITTEN IN IT BUT THIS WAS A TOUR DE FORCE WHICH COULD
ONLY BE CARRIED OUT BY A SPECIALIST IT WAS EXPECTED THAT NEWSPEAK WOULD
HAVE FINALLY SUPERSEDED OLDSPEAK OR STANDARD ENGLISH AS WE SHOULD
CALL IT BY ABOUT THE YEAR 2050 MEANWHILE IT GAINED GROUND STEADILY ALL
PARTY MEMBERS TENDING TO USE NEWSPEAK WORDS AND GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTIONS
MORE AND MORE IN THEIR EVERYDAY SPEECH THE VERSION IN USE IN 1984 AND
EMBODIED IN THE NINTH AND TENTH EDITIONS OF THE NEWSPEAK DICTIONARY WAS
A PROVISIONAL ONE AND CONTAINED MANY SUPERFLUOUS WORDS AND ARCHAIC
FORMATIONS WHICH WERE DUE TO BE SUPPRESSED LATER IT IS WITH THE FINAL
PERFECTED VERSION AS EMBODIED IN THE ELEVENTH EDITION OF THE DICTIONARY
THAT WE ARE CONCERNED HERE

THE PURPOSE OF NEWSPEAK WAS NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE A MEDIUM OF EXPRESSION
FOR THE WORLDVIEW AND MENTAL HABITS PROPER TO THE DEVOTEES OF INGSOC
BUT TO MAKE ALL OTHER MODES OF THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS INTENDED THAT
WHEN NEWSPEAK HAD BEEN ADOPTED ONCE AND FOR ALL AND OLDSPEAK FORGOTTEN
A HERETICAL THOUGHTTHAT IS A THOUGHT DIVERGING FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF
INGSOCSHOULD BE LITERALLY UNTHINKABLE AT LEAST SO FAR AS THOUGHT IS
DEPENDENT ON WORDS ITS VOCABULARY WAS SO CONSTRUCTED AS TO GIVE EXACT AND
OFTEN VERY SUBTLE EXPRESSION TO EVERY MEANING THAT A PARTY MEMBER COULD
PROPERLY WISH TO EXPRESS WHILE EXCLUDING ALL OTHER MEANINGS AND ALSO THE
POSSIBILITY OF ARRIVING AT THEM BY INDIRECT METHODS THIS WAS DONE PARTLY
BY THE INVENTION OF NEW WORDS BUT CHIEFLY BY ELIMINATING UNDESIRABLE
WORDS AND BY STRIPPING SUCH WORDS AS REMAINED OF UNORTHODOX MEANINGS AND
SO FAR AS POSSIBLE OF ALL SECONDARY MEANINGS WHATEVER TO GIVE A SINGLE
EXAMPLE THE WORD FREE STILL EXISTED IN NEWSPEAK BUT IT COULD ONLY BE
USED IN SUCH STATEMENTS AS THIS DOG IS FREE FROM LICE OR THIS FIELD IS
FREE FROM WEEDS IT COULD NOT BE USED IN ITS OLD SENSE OF POLITICALLY
FREE OR INTELLECTUALLY FREE SINCE POLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM NO
LONGER EXISTED EVEN AS CONCEPTS AND WERE THEREFORE OF NECESSITY NAMELESS
QUITE APART FROM THE SUPPRESSION OF DEFINITELY HERETICAL WORDS REDUCTION
OF VOCABULARY WAS REGARDED AS AN END IN ITSELF AND NO WORD THAT COULD BE
DISPENSED WITH WAS ALLOWED TO SURVIVE NEWSPEAK WAS DESIGNED NOT TO EXTEND
BUT TO DIMINISH THE RANGE OF THOUGHT AND THIS PURPOSE WAS INDIRECTLY
ASSISTED BY CUTTING THE CHOICE OF WORDS DOWN TO A MINIMUM

NEWSPEAK WAS FOUNDED ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AS WE NOW KNOW IT THOUGH
MANY NEWSPEAK SENTENCES EVEN WHEN NOT CONTAINING NEWLYCREATED WORDS
WOULD BE BARELY INTELLIGIBLE TO AN ENGLISHSPEAKER OF OUR OWN DAY NEWSPEAK
WORDS WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE DISTINCT CLASSES KNOWN AS THE A VOCABULARY
THE B VOCABULARY ALSO CALLED COMPOUND WORDS AND THE C VOCABULARY
IT WILL BE SIMPLER TO DISCUSS EACH CLASS SEPARATELY BUT THE GRAMMATICAL
PECULIARITIES OF THE LANGUAGE CAN BE DEALT WITH IN THE SECTION DEVOTED TO
THE A VOCABULARY SINCE THE SAME RULES HELD GOOD FOR ALL THREE CATEGORIES


THE A VOCABULARY THE A VOCABULARY CONSISTED OF THE WORDS NEEDED FOR THE
BUSINESS OF EVERYDAY LIFEFOR SUCH THINGS AS EATING DRINKING WORKING
PUTTING ON ONES CLOTHES GOING UP AND DOWN STAIRS RIDING IN VEHICLES
GARDENING COOKING AND THE LIKE IT WAS COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF WORDS
THAT WE ALREADY POSSESS WORDS LIKE HIT RUN DOG TREE SUGAR HOUSE
FIELDBUT IN COMPARISON WITH THE PRESENTDAY ENGLISH VOCABULARY THEIR
NUMBER WAS EXTREMELY SMALL WHILE THEIR MEANINGS WERE FAR MORE RIGIDLY
DEFINED ALL AMBIGUITIES AND SHADES OF MEANING HAD BEEN PURGED OUT OF
THEM SO FAR AS IT COULD BE ACHIEVED A NEWSPEAK WORD OF THIS CLASS WAS
SIMPLY A STACCATO SOUND EXPRESSING ONE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD CONCEPT IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THE A VOCABULARY FOR LITERARY
PURPOSES OR FOR POLITICAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION IT WAS INTENDED
ONLY TO EXPRESS SIMPLE PURPOSIVE THOUGHTS USUALLY INVOLVING CONCRETE
OBJECTS OR PHYSICAL ACTIONS

THE GRAMMAR OF NEWSPEAK HAD TWO OUTSTANDING PECULIARITIES THE FIRST OF
THESE WAS AN ALMOST COMPLETE INTERCHANGEABILITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF
SPEECH ANY WORD IN THE LANGUAGE IN PRINCIPLE THIS APPLIED EVEN TO VERY
ABSTRACT WORDS SUCH AS IF OR WHEN COULD BE USED EITHER AS VERB NOUN
ADJECTIVE OR ADVERB BETWEEN THE VERB AND THE NOUN FORM WHEN THEY WERE
OF THE SAME ROOT THERE WAS NEVER ANY VARIATION THIS RULE OF ITSELF
INVOLVING THE DESTRUCTION OF MANY ARCHAIC FORMS THE WORD THOUGHT FOR
EXAMPLE DID NOT EXIST IN NEWSPEAK ITS PLACE WAS TAKEN BY THINK WHICH
DID DUTY FOR BOTH NOUN AND VERB NO ETYMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE WAS FOLLOWED
HERE IN SOME CASES IT WAS THE ORIGINAL NOUN THAT WAS CHOSEN FOR RETENTION
IN OTHER CASES THE VERB EVEN WHERE A NOUN AND VERB OF KINDRED MEANING
WERE NOT ETYMOLOGICALLY CONNECTED ONE OR OTHER OF THEM WAS FREQUENTLY
SUPPRESSED THERE WAS FOR EXAMPLE NO SUCH WORD AS CUT ITS MEANING BEING
SUFFICIENTLY COVERED BY THE NOUNVERB KNIFE ADJECTIVES WERE FORMED BY
ADDING THE SUFFIX FUL TO THE NOUNVERB AND ADVERBS BY ADDING WISE THUS
FOR EXAMPLE SPEEDFUL MEANT RAPID AND SPEEDWISE MEANT QUICKLY CERTAIN
OF OUR PRESENTDAY ADJECTIVES SUCH AS GOOD STRONG BIG BLACK SOFT
WERE RETAINED BUT THEIR TOTAL NUMBER WAS VERY SMALL THERE WAS LITTLE
NEED FOR THEM SINCE ALMOST ANY ADJECTIVAL MEANING COULD BE ARRIVED AT BY
ADDING FUL TO A NOUNVERB NONE OF THE NOWEXISTING ADVERBS WAS RETAINED
EXCEPT FOR A VERY FEW ALREADY ENDING IN WISE THE WISE TERMINATION WAS
INVARIABLE THE WORD WELL FOR EXAMPLE WAS REPLACED BY GOODWISE

IN ADDITION ANY WORDTHIS AGAIN APPLIED IN PRINCIPLE TO EVERY WORD IN
THE LANGUAGECOULD BE NEGATIVED BY ADDING THE AFFIX UN OR COULD BE
STRENGTHENED BY THE AFFIX PLUS OR FOR STILL GREATER EMPHASIS
DOUBLEPLUS THUS FOR EXAMPLE UNCOLD MEANT WARM WHILE PLUSCOLD AND
DOUBLEPLUSCOLD MEANT RESPECTIVELY VERY COLD AND SUPERLATIVELY COLD
IT WAS ALSO POSSIBLE AS IN PRESENTDAY ENGLISH TO MODIFY THE MEANING OF
ALMOST ANY WORD BY PREPOSITIONAL AFFIXES SUCH AS ANTE POST UP DOWN
ETC BY SUCH METHODS IT WAS FOUND POSSIBLE TO BRING ABOUT AN ENORMOUS
DIMINUTION OF VOCABULARY GIVEN FOR INSTANCE THE WORD GOOD THERE WAS NO
NEED FOR SUCH A WORD AS BAD SINCE THE REQUIRED MEANING WAS EQUALLY
WELLINDEED BETTEREXPRESSED BY UNGOOD ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY IN ANY
CASE WHERE TWO WORDS FORMED A NATURAL PAIR OF OPPOSITES WAS TO DECIDE
WHICH OF THEM TO SUPPRESS DARK FOR EXAMPLE COULD BE REPLACED BY UNLIGHT
OR LIGHT BY UNDARK ACCORDING TO PREFERENCE

THE SECOND DISTINGUISHING MARK OF NEWSPEAK GRAMMAR WAS ITS REGULARITY
SUBJECT TO A FEW EXCEPTIONS WHICH ARE MENTIONED BELOW ALL INFLEXIONS
FOLLOWED THE SAME RULES THUS IN ALL VERBS THE PRETERITE AND THE PAST
PARTICIPLE WERE THE SAME AND ENDED IN ED THE PRETERITE OF STEAL WAS
STEALED THE PRETERITE OF THINK WAS THINKED AND SO ON THROUGHOUT THE
LANGUAGE ALL SUCH FORMS AS SWAM GAVE BROUGHT SPOKE TAKEN ETC BEING
ABOLISHED ALL PLURALS WERE MADE BY ADDING S OR ES AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
THE PLURALS OF MAN OX LIFE WERE MANS OXES LIFES COMPARISON OF
ADJECTIVES WAS INVARIABLY MADE BY ADDING ER EST GOOD GOODER GOODEST
IRREGULAR FORMS AND THE MORE MOST FORMATION BEING SUPPRESSED

THE ONLY CLASSES OF WORDS THAT WERE STILL ALLOWED TO INFLECT IRREGULARLY
WERE THE PRONOUNS THE RELATIVES THE DEMONSTRATIVE ADJECTIVES AND THE
AUXILIARY VERBS ALL OF THESE FOLLOWED THEIR ANCIENT USAGE EXCEPT THAT
WHOM HAD BEEN SCRAPPED AS UNNECESSARY AND THE SHALL SHOULD TENSES HAD
BEEN DROPPED ALL THEIR USES BEING COVERED BY WILL AND WOULD THERE WERE
ALSO CERTAIN IRREGULARITIES IN WORDFORMATION ARISING OUT OF THE NEED FOR
RAPID AND EASY SPEECH A WORD WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO UTTER OR WAS LIABLE
TO BE INCORRECTLY HEARD WAS HELD TO BE IPSO FACTO A BAD WORD OCCASIONALLY
THEREFORE FOR THE SAKE OF EUPHONY EXTRA LETTERS WERE INSERTED INTO A WORD
OR AN ARCHAIC FORMATION WAS RETAINED BUT THIS NEED MADE ITSELF FELT
CHIEFLY IN CONNEXION WITH THE B VOCABULARY WHY SO GREAT AN IMPORTANCE WAS
ATTACHED TO EASE OF PRONUNCIATION WILL BE MADE CLEAR LATER IN THIS ESSAY


THE B VOCABULARY THE B VOCABULARY CONSISTED OF WORDS WHICH HAD BEEN
DELIBERATELY CONSTRUCTED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES WORDS THAT IS TO SAY
WHICH NOT ONLY HAD IN EVERY CASE A POLITICAL IMPLICATION BUT WERE INTENDED
TO IMPOSE A DESIRABLE MENTAL ATTITUDE UPON THE PERSON USING THEM WITHOUT
A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF INGSOC IT WAS DIFFICULT TO USE
THESE WORDS CORRECTLY IN SOME CASES THEY COULD BE TRANSLATED INTO
OLDSPEAK OR EVEN INTO WORDS TAKEN FROM THE A VOCABULARY BUT THIS USUALLY
DEMANDED A LONG PARAPHRASE AND ALWAYS INVOLVED THE LOSS OF CERTAIN
OVERTONES THE B WORDS WERE A SORT OF VERBAL SHORTHAND OFTEN PACKING
WHOLE RANGES OF IDEAS INTO A FEW SYLLABLES AND AT THE SAME TIME MORE
ACCURATE AND FORCIBLE THAN ORDINARY LANGUAGE

THE B WORDS WERE IN ALL CASES COMPOUND WORDS COMPOUND WORDS SUCH AS
SPEAKWRITE WERE OF COURSE TO BE FOUND IN THE A VOCABULARY BUT THESE WERE
MERELY CONVENIENT ABBREVIATIONS AND HAD NO SPECIAL IDEOLOGICAL COLOUR
THEY CONSISTED OF TWO OR MORE WORDS OR PORTIONS OF WORDS WELDED TOGETHER
IN AN EASILY PRONOUNCEABLE FORM THE RESULTING AMALGAM WAS ALWAYS A
NOUNVERB AND INFLECTED ACCORDING TO THE ORDINARY RULES TO TAKE A SINGLE
EXAMPLE THE WORD GOODTHINK MEANING VERY ROUGHLY ORTHODOXY OR IF
ONE CHOSE TO REGARD IT AS A VERB TO THINK IN AN ORTHODOX MANNER THIS
INFLECTED AS FOLLOWS NOUNVERB GOODTHINK PAST TENSE AND PAST PARTICIPLE
GOODTHINKED PRESENT PARTICIPLE GOODTHINKING ADJECTIVE GOODTHINKFUL
ADVERB GOODTHINKWISE VERBAL NOUN GOODTHINKER

THE B WORDS WERE NOT CONSTRUCTED ON ANY ETYMOLOGICAL PLAN THE WORDS OF
WHICH THEY WERE MADE UP COULD BE ANY PARTS OF SPEECH AND COULD BE PLACED
IN ANY ORDER AND MUTILATED IN ANY WAY WHICH MADE THEM EASY TO PRONOUNCE
WHILE INDICATING THEIR DERIVATION IN THE WORD CRIMETHINK THOUGHTCRIME
FOR INSTANCE THE THINK CAME SECOND WHEREAS IN THINKPOL THOUGHT POLICE
IT CAME FIRST AND IN THE LATTER WORD POLICE HAD LOST ITS SECOND SYLLABLE
BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN SECURING EUPHONY IRREGULAR FORMATIONS
WERE COMMONER IN THE B VOCABULARY THAN IN THE A VOCABULARY FOR EXAMPLE
THE ADJECTIVE FORMS OF MINITRUE MINIPAX AND MINILUV WERE RESPECTIVELY
MINITRUTHFUL MINIPEACEFUL AND MINILOVELY SIMPLY BECAUSE TRUEFUL
PAXFUL AND LOVEFUL WERE SLIGHTLY AWKWARD TO PRONOUNCE IN PRINCIPLE
HOWEVER ALL B WORDS COULD INFLECT AND ALL INFLECTED IN EXACTLY THE
SAME WAY

SOME OF THE B WORDS HAD HIGHLY SUBTILIZED MEANINGS BARELY INTELLIGIBLE TO
ANYONE WHO HAD NOT MASTERED THE LANGUAGE AS A WHOLE CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE
SUCH A TYPICAL SENTENCE FROM A TIMES LEADING ARTICLE AS OLDTHINKERS
UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC THE SHORTEST RENDERING THAT ONE COULD MAKE OF THIS
IN OLDSPEAK WOULD BE THOSE WHOSE IDEAS WERE FORMED BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
CANNOT HAVE A FULL EMOTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ENGLISH
SOCIALISM BUT THIS IS NOT AN ADEQUATE TRANSLATION TO BEGIN WITH IN
ORDER TO GRASP THE FULL MEANING OF THE NEWSPEAK SENTENCE QUOTED ABOVE
ONE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT IS MEANT BY INGSOC AND IN
ADDITION ONLY A PERSON THOROUGHLY GROUNDED IN INGSOC COULD APPRECIATE
THE FULL FORCE OF THE WORD BELLYFEEL WHICH IMPLIED A BLIND ENTHUSIASTIC
ACCEPTANCE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE TODAY OR OF THE WORD OLDTHINK WHICH WAS
INEXTRICABLY MIXED UP WITH THE IDEA OF WICKEDNESS AND DECADENCE BUT THE
SPECIAL FUNCTION OF CERTAIN NEWSPEAK WORDS OF WHICH OLDTHINK WAS ONE
WAS NOT SO MUCH TO EXPRESS MEANINGS AS TO DESTROY THEM THESE WORDS
NECESSARILY FEW IN NUMBER HAD HAD THEIR MEANINGS EXTENDED UNTIL THEY
CONTAINED WITHIN THEMSELVES WHOLE BATTERIES OF WORDS WHICH AS THEY WERE
SUFFICIENTLY COVERED BY A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE TERM COULD NOW BE SCRAPPED
AND FORGOTTEN THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY FACING THE COMPILERS OF THE NEWSPEAK
DICTIONARY WAS NOT TO INVENT NEW WORDS BUT HAVING INVENTED THEM TO MAKE
SURE WHAT THEY MEANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS TO SAY WHAT RANGES OF WORDS
THEY CANCELLED BY THEIR EXISTENCE

AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE CASE OF THE WORD FREE WORDS WHICH HAD
ONCE BORNE A HERETICAL MEANING WERE SOMETIMES RETAINED FOR THE SAKE OF
CONVENIENCE BUT ONLY WITH THE UNDESIRABLE MEANINGS PURGED OUT OF THEM
COUNTLESS OTHER WORDS SUCH AS HONOUR JUSTICE MORALITY INTERNATIONALISM
DEMOCRACY SCIENCE AND RELIGION HAD SIMPLY CEASED TO EXIST A FEW BLANKET
WORDS COVERED THEM AND IN COVERING THEM ABOLISHED THEM ALL WORDS
GROUPING THEMSELVES ROUND THE CONCEPTS OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY FOR
INSTANCE WERE CONTAINED IN THE SINGLE WORD CRIMETHINK WHILE ALL WORDS
GROUPING THEMSELVES ROUND THE CONCEPTS OF OBJECTIVITY AND RATIONALISM
WERE CONTAINED IN THE SINGLE WORD OLDTHINK GREATER PRECISION WOULD HAVE
BEEN DANGEROUS WHAT WAS REQUIRED IN A PARTY MEMBER WAS AN OUTLOOK SIMILAR
TO THAT OF THE ANCIENT HEBREW WHO KNEW WITHOUT KNOWING MUCH ELSE THAT
ALL NATIONS OTHER THAN HIS OWN WORSHIPPED FALSE GODS HE DID NOT NEED TO
KNOW THAT THESE GODS WERE CALLED BAAL OSIRIS MOLOCH ASHTAROTH AND THE
LIKE PROBABLY THE LESS HE KNEW ABOUT THEM THE BETTER FOR HIS ORTHODOXY
HE KNEW JEHOVAH AND THE COMMANDMENTS OF JEHOVAH HE KNEW THEREFORE THAT
ALL GODS WITH OTHER NAMES OR OTHER ATTRIBUTES WERE FALSE GODS IN SOMEWHAT
THE SAME WAY THE PARTY MEMBER KNEW WHAT CONSTITUTED RIGHT CONDUCT AND IN
EXCEEDINGLY VAGUE GENERALIZED TERMS HE KNEW WHAT KINDS OF DEPARTURE FROM
IT WERE POSSIBLE HIS SEXUAL LIFE FOR EXAMPLE WAS ENTIRELY REGULATED BY
THE TWO NEWSPEAK WORDS SEXCRIME SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND GOODSEX CHASTITY
SEXCRIME COVERED ALL SEXUAL MISDEEDS WHATEVER IT COVERED FORNICATION
ADULTERY HOMOSEXUALITY AND OTHER PERVERSIONS AND IN ADDITION NORMAL
INTERCOURSE PRACTISED FOR ITS OWN SAKE THERE WAS NO NEED TO ENUMERATE
THEM SEPARATELY SINCE THEY WERE ALL EQUALLY CULPABLE AND IN PRINCIPLE
ALL PUNISHABLE BY DEATH IN THE C VOCABULARY WHICH CONSISTED OF SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNICAL WORDS IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO GIVE SPECIALIZED NAMES TO
CERTAIN SEXUAL ABERRATIONS BUT THE ORDINARY CITIZEN HAD NO NEED OF THEM
HE KNEW WHAT WAS MEANT BY GOODSEXTHAT IS TO SAY NORMAL INTERCOURSE
BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF BEGETTING CHILDREN AND
WITHOUT PHYSICAL PLEASURE ON THE PART OF THE WOMAN ALL ELSE WAS SEXCRIME
IN NEWSPEAK IT WAS SELDOM POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW A HERETICAL THOUGHT FURTHER
THAN THE PERCEPTION THAT IT WAS HERETICAL BEYOND THAT POINT THE NECESSARY
WORDS WERE NONEXISTENT

NO WORD IN THE B VOCABULARY WAS IDEOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL A GREAT MANY WERE
EUPHEMISMS SUCH WORDS FOR INSTANCE AS JOYCAMP FORCEDLABOUR CAMP OR
MINIPAX MINISTRY OF PEACE IE MINISTRY OF WAR MEANT ALMOST THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY APPEARED TO MEAN SOME WORDS ON THE OTHER HAND
DISPLAYED A FRANK AND CONTEMPTUOUS UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL NATURE OF
OCEANIC SOCIETY AN EXAMPLE WAS PROLEFEED MEANING THE RUBBISHY
ENTERTAINMENT AND SPURIOUS NEWS WHICH THE PARTY HANDED OUT TO THE MASSES
OTHER WORDS AGAIN WERE AMBIVALENT HAVING THE CONNOTATION GOOD WHEN
APPLIED TO THE PARTY AND BAD WHEN APPLIED TO ITS ENEMIES BUT IN
ADDITION THERE WERE GREAT NUMBERS OF WORDS WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARED
TO BE MERE ABBREVIATIONS AND WHICH DERIVED THEIR IDEOLOGICAL COLOUR NOT
FROM THEIR MEANING BUT FROM THEIR STRUCTURE

SO FAR AS IT COULD BE CONTRIVED EVERYTHING THAT HAD OR MIGHT HAVE
POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ANY KIND WAS FITTED INTO THE B VOCABULARY THE
NAME OF EVERY ORGANIZATION OR BODY OF PEOPLE OR DOCTRINE OR COUNTRY OR
INSTITUTION OR PUBLIC BUILDING WAS INVARIABLY CUT DOWN INTO THE FAMILIAR
SHAPE THAT IS A SINGLE EASILY PRONOUNCED WORD WITH THE SMALLEST NUMBER
OF SYLLABLES THAT WOULD PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL DERIVATION IN THE MINISTRY
OF TRUTH FOR EXAMPLE THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT IN WHICH WINSTON SMITH
WORKED WAS CALLED RECDEP THE FICTION DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED FICDEP THE
TELEPROGRAMMES DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TELEDEP AND SO ON THIS WAS NOT
DONE SOLELY WITH THE OBJECT OF SAVING TIME EVEN IN THE EARLY DECADES OF
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TELESCOPED WORDS AND PHRASES HAD BEEN ONE OF THE
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF POLITICAL LANGUAGE AND IT HAD BEEN NOTICED
THAT THE TENDENCY TO USE ABBREVIATIONS OF THIS KIND WAS MOST MARKED IN
TOTALITARIAN COUNTRIES AND TOTALITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS EXAMPLES WERE SUCH
WORDS AS NAZI GESTAPO COMINTERN INPRECORR AGITPROP IN THE BEGINNING
THE PRACTICE HAD BEEN ADOPTED AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY BUT IN NEWSPEAK
IT WAS USED WITH A CONSCIOUS PURPOSE IT WAS PERCEIVED THAT IN THUS
ABBREVIATING A NAME ONE NARROWED AND SUBTLY ALTERED ITS MEANING BY
CUTTING OUT MOST OF THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CLING TO IT
THE WORDS COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL FOR INSTANCE CALL UP A COMPOSITE
PICTURE OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN BROTHERHOOD RED FLAGS BARRICADES KARL MARX
AND THE PARIS COMMUNE THE WORD COMINTERN ON THE OTHER HAND SUGGESTS
MERELY A TIGHTLYKNIT ORGANIZATION AND A WELLDEFINED BODY OF DOCTRINE
IT REFERS TO SOMETHING ALMOST AS EASILY RECOGNIZED AND AS LIMITED IN
PURPOSE AS A CHAIR OR A TABLE COMINTERN IS A WORD THAT CAN BE UTTERED
ALMOST WITHOUT TAKING THOUGHT WHEREAS COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL IS A PHRASE
OVER WHICH ONE IS OBLIGED TO LINGER AT LEAST MOMENTARILY IN THE SAME WAY
THE ASSOCIATIONS CALLED UP BY A WORD LIKE MINITRUE ARE FEWER AND MORE
CONTROLLABLE THAN THOSE CALLED UP BY MINISTRY OF TRUTH THIS ACCOUNTED NOT
ONLY FOR THE HABIT OF ABBREVIATING WHENEVER POSSIBLE BUT ALSO FOR THE
ALMOST EXAGGERATED CARE THAT WAS TAKEN TO MAKE EVERY WORD EASILY
PRONOUNCEABLE

IN NEWSPEAK EUPHONY OUTWEIGHED EVERY CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN EXACTITUDE
OF MEANING REGULARITY OF GRAMMAR WAS ALWAYS SACRIFICED TO IT WHEN IT
SEEMED NECESSARY AND RIGHTLY SO SINCE WHAT WAS REQUIRED ABOVE ALL FOR
POLITICAL PURPOSES WAS SHORT CLIPPED WORDS OF UNMISTAKABLE MEANING WHICH
COULD BE UTTERED RAPIDLY AND WHICH ROUSED THE MINIMUM OF ECHOES IN THE
SPEAKERS MIND THE WORDS OF THE B VOCABULARY EVEN GAINED IN FORCE FROM
THE FACT THAT NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE VERY MUCH ALIKE ALMOST INVARIABLY
THESE WORDSGOODTHINK MINIPAX PROLEFEED SEXCRIME JOYCAMP INGSOC
BELLYFEEL THINKPOL AND COUNTLESS OTHERSWERE WORDS OF TWO OR THREE
SYLLABLES WITH THE STRESS DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE FIRST SYLLABLE
AND THE LAST THE USE OF THEM ENCOURAGED A GABBLING STYLE OF SPEECH AT
ONCE STACCATO AND MONOTONOUS AND THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS AIMED AT THE
INTENTION WAS TO MAKE SPEECH AND ESPECIALLY SPEECH ON ANY SUBJECT NOT
IDEOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE INDEPENDENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS
FOR THE PURPOSES OF EVERYDAY LIFE IT WAS NO DOUBT NECESSARY OR SOMETIMES
NECESSARY TO REFLECT BEFORE SPEAKING BUT A PARTY MEMBER CALLED UPON TO
MAKE A POLITICAL OR ETHICAL JUDGEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPRAY FORTH THE
CORRECT OPINIONS AS AUTOMATICALLY AS A MACHINE GUN SPRAYING FORTH BULLETS
HIS TRAINING FITTED HIM TO DO THIS THE LANGUAGE GAVE HIM AN ALMOST
FOOLPROOF INSTRUMENT AND THE TEXTURE OF THE WORDS WITH THEIR HARSH SOUND
AND A CERTAIN WILFUL UGLINESS WHICH WAS IN ACCORD WITH THE SPIRIT OF
INGSOC ASSISTED THE PROCESS STILL FURTHER

SO DID THE FACT OF HAVING VERY FEW WORDS TO CHOOSE FROM RELATIVE TO OUR
OWN THE NEWSPEAK VOCABULARY WAS TINY AND NEW WAYS OF REDUCING IT WERE
CONSTANTLY BEING DEVISED NEWSPEAK INDEED DIFFERED FROM MOST ALL OTHER
LANGUAGES IN THAT ITS VOCABULARY GREW SMALLER INSTEAD OF LARGER EVERY
YEAR EACH REDUCTION WAS A GAIN SINCE THE SMALLER THE AREA OF CHOICE
THE SMALLER THE TEMPTATION TO TAKE THOUGHT ULTIMATELY IT WAS HOPED TO
MAKE ARTICULATE SPEECH ISSUE FROM THE LARYNX WITHOUT INVOLVING THE HIGHER
BRAIN CENTRES AT ALL THIS AIM WAS FRANKLY ADMITTED IN THE NEWSPEAK WORD
DUCKSPEAK MEANING TO QUACK LIKE A DUCK LIKE VARIOUS OTHER WORDS IN
THE B VOCABULARY DUCKSPEAK WAS AMBIVALENT IN MEANING PROVIDED THAT THE
OPINIONS WHICH WERE QUACKED OUT WERE ORTHODOX ONES IT IMPLIED NOTHING BUT
PRAISE AND WHEN THE TIMES REFERRED TO ONE OF THE ORATORS OF THE PARTY
AS A DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER IT WAS PAYING A WARM AND VALUED COMPLIMENT


THE C VOCABULARY THE C VOCABULARY WAS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE OTHERS AND
CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TERMS THESE RESEMBLED THE
SCIENTIFIC TERMS IN USE TODAY AND WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM THE SAME ROOTS
BUT THE USUAL CARE WAS TAKEN TO DEFINE THEM RIGIDLY AND STRIP THEM OF
UNDESIRABLE MEANINGS THEY FOLLOWED THE SAME GRAMMATICAL RULES AS THE
WORDS IN THE OTHER TWO VOCABULARIES VERY FEW OF THE C WORDS HAD ANY
CURRENCY EITHER IN EVERYDAY SPEECH OR IN POLITICAL SPEECH ANY SCIENTIFIC
WORKER OR TECHNICIAN COULD FIND ALL THE WORDS HE NEEDED IN THE LIST DEVOTED
TO HIS OWN SPECIALITY BUT HE SELDOM HAD MORE THAN A SMATTERING OF THE
WORDS OCCURRING IN THE OTHER LISTS ONLY A VERY FEW WORDS WERE COMMON TO
ALL LISTS AND THERE WAS NO VOCABULARY EXPRESSING THE FUNCTION OF SCIENCE
AS A HABIT OF MIND OR A METHOD OF THOUGHT IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS PARTICULAR
BRANCHES THERE WAS INDEED NO WORD FOR SCIENCE ANY MEANING THAT IT
COULD POSSIBLY BEAR BEING ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY COVERED BY THE WORD INGSOC

FROM THE FOREGOING ACCOUNT IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN NEWSPEAK THE EXPRESSION
OF UNORTHODOX OPINIONS ABOVE A VERY LOW LEVEL WAS WELLNIGH IMPOSSIBLE
IT WAS OF COURSE POSSIBLE TO UTTER HERESIES OF A VERY CRUDE KIND A
SPECIES OF BLASPHEMY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE TO SAY
BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD BUT THIS STATEMENT WHICH TO AN ORTHODOX EAR MERELY
CONVEYED A SELFEVIDENT ABSURDITY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED BY
REASONED ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE NECESSARY WORDS WERE NOT AVAILABLE IDEAS
INIMICAL TO INGSOC COULD ONLY BE ENTERTAINED IN A VAGUE WORDLESS FORM
AND COULD ONLY BE NAMED IN VERY BROAD TERMS WHICH LUMPED TOGETHER AND
CONDEMNED WHOLE GROUPS OF HERESIES WITHOUT DEFINING THEM IN DOING SO
ONE COULD IN FACT ONLY USE NEWSPEAK FOR UNORTHODOX PURPOSES BY
ILLEGITIMATELY TRANSLATING SOME OF THE WORDS BACK INTO OLDSPEAK FOR
EXAMPLE ALL MANS ARE EQUAL WAS A POSSIBLE NEWSPEAK SENTENCE BUT ONLY
IN THE SAME SENSE IN WHICH ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED IS A POSSIBLE OLDSPEAK
SENTENCE IT DID NOT CONTAIN A GRAMMATICAL ERROR BUT IT EXPRESSED
A PALPABLE UNTRUTHIE THAT ALL MEN ARE OF EQUAL SIZE WEIGHT OR
STRENGTH THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL EQUALITY NO LONGER EXISTED AND THIS
SECONDARY MEANING HAD ACCORDINGLY BEEN PURGED OUT OF THE WORD EQUAL
IN 1984 WHEN OLDSPEAK WAS STILL THE NORMAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION
THE DANGER THEORETICALLY EXISTED THAT IN USING NEWSPEAK WORDS ONE MIGHT
REMEMBER THEIR ORIGINAL MEANINGS IN PRACTICE IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR
ANY PERSON WELL GROUNDED IN DOUBLETHINK TO AVOID DOING THIS BUT WITHIN
A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A LAPSE WOULD HAVE
VANISHED A PERSON GROWING UP WITH NEWSPEAK AS HIS SOLE LANGUAGE WOULD NO
MORE KNOW THAT EQUAL HAD ONCE HAD THE SECONDARY MEANING OF POLITICALLY
EQUAL OR THAT FREE HAD ONCE MEANT INTELLECTUALLY FREE THAN FOR
INSTANCE A PERSON WHO HAD NEVER HEARD OF CHESS WOULD BE AWARE OF THE
SECONDARY MEANINGS ATTACHING TO QUEEN AND ROOK THERE WOULD BE MANY
CRIMES AND ERRORS WHICH IT WOULD BE BEYOND HIS POWER TO COMMIT SIMPLY
BECAUSE THEY WERE NAMELESS AND THEREFORE UNIMAGINABLE AND IT WAS TO BE
FORESEEN THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS
OF NEWSPEAK WOULD BECOME MORE AND MORE PRONOUNCEDITS WORDS GROWING
FEWER AND FEWER THEIR MEANINGS MORE AND MORE RIGID AND THE CHANCE OF
PUTTING THEM TO IMPROPER USES ALWAYS DIMINISHING

WHEN OLDSPEAK HAD BEEN ONCE AND FOR ALL SUPERSEDED THE LAST LINK WITH
THE PAST WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVERED HISTORY HAD ALREADY BEEN REWRITTEN
BUT FRAGMENTS OF THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST SURVIVED HERE AND THERE
IMPERFECTLY CENSORED AND SO LONG AS ONE RETAINED ONES KNOWLEDGE OF
OLDSPEAK IT WAS POSSIBLE TO READ THEM IN THE FUTURE SUCH FRAGMENTS EVEN
IF THEY CHANCED TO SURVIVE WOULD BE UNINTELLIGIBLE AND UNTRANSLATABLE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSLATE ANY PASSAGE OF OLDSPEAK INTO NEWSPEAK UNLESS
IT EITHER REFERRED TO SOME TECHNICAL PROCESS OR SOME VERY SIMPLE EVERYDAY
ACTION OR WAS ALREADY ORTHODOX GOODTHINKFUL WOULD BE THE NEWSPEAK
EXPRESSION IN TENDENCY IN PRACTICE THIS MEANT THAT NO BOOK WRITTEN BEFORE
APPROXIMATELY 1960 COULD BE TRANSLATED AS A WHOLE PREREVOLUTIONARY
LITERATURE COULD ONLY BE SUBJECTED TO IDEOLOGICAL TRANSLATIONTHAT IS
ALTERATION IN SENSE AS WELL AS LANGUAGE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE WELLKNOWN
PASSAGE FROM THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE


WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELFEVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS
THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN
DERIVING THEIR POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED THAT WHENEVER
ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS IT IS THE RIGHT
OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT


IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO RENDER THIS INTO NEWSPEAK WHILE
KEEPING TO THE SENSE OF THE ORIGINAL THE NEAREST ONE COULD COME TO DOING
SO WOULD BE TO SWALLOW THE WHOLE PASSAGE UP IN THE SINGLE WORD CRIMETHINK
A FULL TRANSLATION COULD ONLY BE AN IDEOLOGICAL TRANSLATION WHEREBY
JEFFERSONS WORDS WOULD BE CHANGED INTO A PANEGYRIC ON ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENT

A GOOD DEAL OF THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST WAS INDEED ALREADY BEING
TRANSFORMED IN THIS WAY CONSIDERATIONS OF PRESTIGE MADE IT DESIRABLE TO
PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF CERTAIN HISTORICAL FIGURES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
BRINGING THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS INTO LINE WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF INGSOC
VARIOUS WRITERS SUCH AS SHAKESPEARE MILTON SWIFT BYRON DICKENS AND
SOME OTHERS WERE THEREFORE IN PROCESS OF TRANSLATION WHEN THE TASK HAD
BEEN COMPLETED THEIR ORIGINAL WRITINGS WITH ALL ELSE THAT SURVIVED OF
THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST WOULD BE DESTROYED THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE
A SLOW AND DIFFICULT BUSINESS AND IT WAS NOT EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD
BE FINISHED BEFORE THE FIRST OR SECOND DECADE OF THE TWENTYFIRST
CENTURY THERE WERE ALSO LARGE QUANTITIES OF MERELY UTILITARIAN
LITERATUREINDISPENSABLE TECHNICAL MANUALS AND THE LIKETHAT HAD TO
BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY IT WAS CHIEFLY IN ORDER TO ALLOW TIME FOR
THE PRELIMINARY WORK OF TRANSLATION THAT THE FINAL ADOPTION OF NEWSPEAK
HAD BEEN FIXED FOR SO LATE A DATE AS 2050
