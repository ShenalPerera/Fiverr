Hi, I was wondering if it was possible to go over a coding project on GitHub to help break it down in-depth so I can understand the thought process and sequence behind it? 
Or if you would be able to review the code according to the guidelines and comment what order each function should be done so it can be recreated.
Guidelines:

Actual Code:
