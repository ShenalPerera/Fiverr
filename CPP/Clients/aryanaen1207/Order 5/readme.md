## Code reflecting

##### 1.How did you approach the problem?
_According to the description there is a requirement sorting and print the results. In other words courses should be sorrted before printing.When courses are grwoing complexcities of the sorting algorithm is also growing. Therefore,decided to use BST to solve this. It will soring and printing but preserve the order. Therefore, selecting a better data structure will solve most of the problems._

##### 2. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
_Breakdown the problem into small parts called building blocks. Then integrate that pasrts together. In this project readline of the files and update relevant fields of the node is very hard at the same time. Therefore, there is a seperate function to parse the line into tokens. The other roadblock is to sort and printing. Todo this task with less memory and runtime decied to choose Binary search tree. There are prerequisite for each course. To hlod that only a vector use that holds only the name. by doing that we can save the lot of memory._

##### 3. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
_This project has several areas that a programmer should focus when designing. In here it improves how to analyze the problem bofore it implements. By doing these runtime and memroy analyzing we can improve our approach to design better  softwares._

##### 4.How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
_In here before implementing the code we did a analyze. By doing we can have an abstract level coding blocks that can be used for any data structure. To code to be a readable code should devided into seperate parts. Each unit should do an unqiue task. By doing that we can preserve the "Do not repeat yourself". In this project there was chanse to handle that skills when wrting the program._
